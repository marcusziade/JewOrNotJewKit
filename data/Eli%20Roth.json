  "description": "Don't get us wrong, Quentin Tarantino's films are awesome. Every single one of them. Alright, maybe not Death Proof. But all the others: awesome.\n\nBut if we are to nitpick... well, some of Tarantino's casting choices are not exactly ideal. Oh, sure, sometimes he strikes gold (thank you for introducing Christoph Waltz to the American audience, Quentin), but sometimes...\n\nAnd it's not just shoehorning himself into every movie. (Give it up, Quentin. You're a great director. You just might be the worst actor in the world.) It's casting choices such as Eli Roth as the baseball-bat-wielding Bear Jew in Inglourious Basterds.\n\nAgain, don't get us wrong, Basterds is awesome. But upon re-watching it, we couldn't help but cringe every time Roth hammed it up on the screen. He's a horror film director, Quentin! Why did you ever think he could act?\n\nBut here's the thing: Roth wasn't even Tarantino's first choice for the role. It was...\n\nAdam Sandler.\n\nCasting, Quentin. Casting.",
