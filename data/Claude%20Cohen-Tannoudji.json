  "description": "How should we say this nicely... Africans don't win too many Nobels. There have been some winners in Literature and Peace, but those are far and between. Scientific Nobels? We've counted a total of six. In fact, only two Africans have ever won the Nobel for Physics.\n\nWould you believe that BOTH of those Africans were Jewish!\n\nAlright, perhaps calling them Africans is a tad of a stretch, since each has been living in France for more than half a century. And yet, \nClaude Cohen-Tannoudji, laureate in 1997, was born in Algeria. Serge Haroche, laureate in 2012 (and Cohen-Tannoudji's student!), was born in Morocco.\n\nWe're not saying that being more open to Jews will help African countries win more Nobels...\n\nBut it can't hurt?",
