  "description": "Nazis. We hate those guys.\n\nOf course, today's Nazis are a shadow of their 1930s and 40s brethren. Today's Nazis spew their hate not on the streets, but over the internet. Stupid, stupid Nazis.\n\nPart of that internet hate-mongering? Made-up Jewish rumors. Like the one about Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThat's right, FDR. You see, the rumor says that his great-great-great-great-great grandfather might have been Jewish. Not WAS Jewish. MIGHT have been Jewish. Not his grandfather. His great-great-great-great-great grandfather. So, according to the internet Nazis, that makes FDR a Jew.\n\nAnd you know what, internet Nazis? Fine. Great! We'll take FDR! How could we say no to the man who kicked your ass so hard it's been hurting for over 60 years? FDR, Jew? Yes!\n\nSigh.\n\nOh, why do we run such an honest website? FDR's ancestors were not Jewish. There were Dutch and French, of various Christian denominations. There are rumors that he had Jewish roots on his maternal site, but there is absolutely no confirmation. He himself was Episcopal. So no, FDR, not a Jew.\n\nStupid, stupid Nazis.",
