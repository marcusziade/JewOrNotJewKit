  "description": "We're so used to sports announcers, but do we really need them?\n\nBack in the days of radio, we definitely did. In fact, have you ever tried to listen to a game on the radio without an announcer? It's just not gonna work. Alright, no one who is reading this ever listened to a game on a radio. Moving on.\n\nSay you watch a game live at the stadium. There is no one out there explaining what's happening on the field and regurgitating the minutia of \"fun\" player facts and statistics. (That's not exactly true; some people like that sit in the stands. They usually wear vintage jerseys. You try to move as far from them as possible.)\n\nSo why is it different when watching on television? Are we just conditioned to announcers as background noise?\n\nWhich brings us to Steve Levy, who parlayed two decades on ESPN into that supposedly-coveted Monday Night Football gig. Good for him!",
