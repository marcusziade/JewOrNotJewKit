  "description": "In 1939, Joe Greenstein, an unassuming, short man in his 40s, was walking in New York City when he saw a sign \"No dogs and Jews allowed\". So he went to a sporting goods store, bought a baseball bat, and proceeded to kick the shit out of 18 Nazis. True story.\n\nFor Joe Greenstein was not just a man, he was \"The Mighty Atom\", a strongman whose lithe build hid the power within. When he was in his 20s, a man who was in love with Joe's wife shot him between the eyebrows. The bullet was flattened by Joe's head. True story.\n\nAmong the strongmen feats performed by Joe were biting nails and quarters in half, pulling a truck with his HAIR, hammering nails with his bare hands, and lying on a bed of nails (again with the nails!) while a 14-man Dixieland band played on his chest (that must have been one large chest or 14 very, very tiny people). All true stories.\n\nBack to 1939. Greenstein was arrested for his actions, and had to appear in court to face the Nazis that he maimed. But as soon as the truth came out â€” that the Nazis first attacked Joe, and that they were, in fact, NAZIS, the judge immediately dismissed the case.\n\nTrue story!",
