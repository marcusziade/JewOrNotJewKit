That's 20 whole episodes.\n\nDid you like it?\n\nThen why did you keep watching it?\n\nYou watched it for me, didn't you?\n\nYou watched it because I'm such an enigma, such a cipher...\n\n\"Is he?\", you asked. \"Is this abhorrent character Jewish?\"\n\nDo you truly think I'm abhorrent? And if so, why did you keep watching?\n\nI kept you guessing, didn't I? Like that time when someone asked me if I was a self-loathing Jew...\n\nYour ears perked up, didn't they? And when I didn't respond, what did you do?\n\nYou still kept watching.\n\nYou thought you could solve my mystery?\n\nDid you?",
