  "description": "You don't know Ethan Zuckerman, but you should. He's the inventor of one of the most important, impactful creations of the last 30 years. Sadly, that invention was the pop-up ad.\n\nZuckerman attended Williams College, where he received a degree in philosophy which should have informed him that what he did after was morally reprehensible. As part of one of the first successful dot coms, he invented a way to associate an ad with a user's page without actually attaching it to the page.\n\nY'know, a pop-up ad.\n\nvar cur = 0;\ninterval = 1200;\nfunction hidePic() {\n  if (cur \u003e= 5) return;\n  show('pic'+cur, 'none');\n  setTimeout('showPic()', interval);\n}\nfunction showPic() {\n  cur++;\n  show('pic'+cur, 'inline');\n}\nfunction show(d, b) {\n  var dd = document.getElementById(d);\n  dd.style.display = b;\n}\nsetTimeout('showPic()', interval);",
