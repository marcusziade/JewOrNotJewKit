  "description": "Vidal Sassoon has been called \"the father of modern hairdressing\". He popularized the bob cut and styled stars from Goldie Hawn to Cameron Diaz. Whatever; hair, shmair. Let's talk about what Sassoon did before he entered the world of barbery.\n\nWhen World War II ended, fascism was defeated in Continental Europe. Alas, in England, the powerful force of far right ideology started to rise. Men like Oswald Mosley became more and more influential, and budding fascists started to take out their anger on Jews. (We are talking about late 1940s England here. Any similarities to other countries and times are completely intentional.)\n\nEngland's Jews wouldn't stand for it. The 43 Group was formed, made for the most part from those who served in World War II. Those Jews, who fought fascism on the continent, now did so in their own country.\n\nVidal Sassoon was too young to go to war, but he did join the 43 Group. He helped break up fascist meetings, making sure their message of hate stopped spreading. Yes, Vidal Sassoon fought for antifa. (He also served in the Israeli Army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.)\n\nAnd you thought this profile was going to be about hair!",
