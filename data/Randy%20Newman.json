  "description": "A lot of people are upset with the hippie generation of the 1960s and 70s, especially the artists. These were people truly bucking the system, breaking with tradition to create a new, transgressive medium that was intended to change the way people thought.\n\nBut then the 1990s came and they all sold out.\n\nWell, we would respectfully disagree. Many of these amazing creators stuck with their creative vision and continued to do truly revolutionary work.\n\nTake singer/songwriter/composer Randy Newman, he of the nasal voice and the love for LA.\n\n1977: Short People. \"Short people got no reason to live.\"\n\n1995: Toy Story. \"You've got a friend in me.\"\n\nOh. Never mind.",
