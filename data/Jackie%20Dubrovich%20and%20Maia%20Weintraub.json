  "description": "\"Dubrovich and Weintraub\" sounds like a law firm, doesn't it?\n\n(We must have made a similar joke before. Let's check. Yes, we have. 3500 profiles, what are you gonna do. Let's continue.)\n\nSo, yeah, we don't usually do this, but we couldn't pick one of Jackie Dubrovich or Maia Weintraub to profile. So here they are together, biting their gold metals. Two Jewish women, one from New Jersey and the other from Philadelphia, on the American champion foil team!\n\nThey couldn't do it alone, of course. The foil team is made up of four fencers, so Dubrovich and Weintraub were joined by the Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs. Considering that Kiefer just repeated as the individual gold medalist and Scruggs got the individual silver, not a bad pair of goyim to team up with!\n\nWhat about \"Dubrovich, Weintraub, Kiefer, and Scruggs\"?",
