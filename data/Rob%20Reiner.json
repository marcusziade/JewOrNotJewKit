  "description": "Romantic comedies are neither romantic nor comedies. Discuss.\n\nEvery year, Hollywood churns out dozens of films of the supposed genre. You know the drill: guy meets girl, guy likes girl, girl likes guy, a lie keeps them apart, they come together at the end. True love! Katherine Heigl may be involved. There are variations, of course, but the template is clear.\n\nThese movies are not romantic; more often than not, there is no chemistry between the two leads. These movies are not comedic, unless you can find laughter in a non-stop array of cliches supplied by the wise-cracking best friend. We can't.\n\nAre there exceptions?\n\nSure. \"When Harry Met Sally\", romantic and comedic. Can we count \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\"? That's British, it's not really Hollywood. So is \"Love Actually\". Anything else? We can't really think of it at the moment.\n\nCome on, Rob Reiner! You have it in you, we know! Harry and Sally was great, you can recapture the magic! What have you done since then, anyway?\n\nOh. Make terrible romantic comedies. Figures.",
