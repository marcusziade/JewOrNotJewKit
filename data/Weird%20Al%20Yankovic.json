  "description": "There are actually a lot of Jewich rockers out there. Some are cooler than others, but they've all been considered successful at some point in their careers and they're all Jews. \n\nSome are cool, like Gene Simmons, Joey Ramone, or the Beastie Boys. Others had peaks, but fell from grace, like David Lee Roth. Most seem to not be observant, or even openly Jewish. Certainly they wouldn't do something like sing about rabbis or use Yiddish lyrics.\n\nY'know who would?\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic, parodist of everyone from rockers to rappers. Player of polkas. Discoverer of Michael Richards (remember when that was a good thing?)\n\nAnd no, he may not be the coolest guy around (and rumor has it, his die hard fans are even worse). But we're not ashamed to say we've enjoyed his work. Heck, his success has outlasted a lot of other so-called musicians we've profiled. \n\nThere's just one problem:\n\n(ohhhhh, you peeked!)",
