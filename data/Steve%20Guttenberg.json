  "description": "If aliens came down on Earth on December 31, 1989, and asked who the biggest comedy star on this planet is (although it's hard to imagine aliens who are so interested in comedy, but allow us this hypothesis), one would be hard pressed to select someone other than Steve Guttenberg.\n\n\"Diner\". \"Police Academy\". \"Three Men and a Baby\". \"Police Academy 2\". \"Short Circuit\". \"Police Academy 4\". These movies, for better or worse, defined the American comedy film of the 1980s, and all were headlined by Steve Guttenberg. All hail Guttenberg!\n\nAlas, as the 80s departed us, so did Guttenberg's success. And now he is supposed to be involved in some cable TV project where he is going to play... a Jewish alien. Shrug. Seriously, Steve. If you are doing that to raise your Jew Score on this website, that's not helping. We expect better from you.\n\nOh, whom do we kid! We should expect nothing. Underneath that tidy Jewfro and that smirk is not an ounce of talent. Oh well. At least he was smart enough to stay out of \"Police Academy 5\".",
