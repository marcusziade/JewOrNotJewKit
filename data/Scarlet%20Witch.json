  "description": "You are really, really good it your job. It doesn't matter what it is: computer programming, lumberjacking, supervillainy. You're great at it.\n\nYou meet a woman, roughly half your age, who seems good at that job too! Terrific, you think. Nothing like a protege in your field! (Which, face it, doesn't have too many women: computer programming, lumberjacking, supervillainy.)\n\nAnd then — bombshell — that woman turns out to be your daughter! You see, your beloved wife did die, but not before giving birth to twins. You are overjoyed. You and your newfound daughter can work together, reaching new heights in whatever field you are in (computer programming, lumberjacking, supervillainy)!\n\nBut then, something happens. Your daughter becomes disillusioned (with  computer programming, lumberjacking, supervillainy). She no longer wants to work beside you. She leaves. In fact, she starts working for the other side.\n\nYou feel terrible. You didn't even have a chance to tell her that she is Jewish!",
