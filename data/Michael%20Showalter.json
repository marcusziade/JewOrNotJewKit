  "description": "The words \"cult classic\" get thrown a lot a lot, but, when you get down to it, \"Wet Hot American Summer\" is one that fits the bill. Virtually ignored when it came out in 2001, it rose from obscurity to an immense following.\n\nWHAS, co-created by Jews David Wain and Michael Showalter, parodies the story of a summer camp â€” not, not a Jewish summer camp, but a JEWY summer camp. Have fun tagging along and play either \"Spot the Jew\" (Hey! That's Paul Rudd!) or \"Spot the Jewish joke\" (Showalter as \"Coop\" Cooperberg, when calling his parents after finally talking to his dream girl: \"Well, she might be. She's got a pretty big nose.\")\n\nMany of the stars of WHAS have gone on to greater things: the aforementioned Rudd, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Bradley Cooper... This culminated with Netflix making not one, but two series: a prequel (Where the now-40-year-olds play teenagers. That's the joke, but Rudd actually pulls it off; it's as if he has a portrait decaying in his attic.), and a sequel.\n\nSo now, after all these years, \"Wet Hot American Summer\" is popular. Can it still be considered a cult classic?",
