  "description": "In the Baseball Hall of Fame, Mike Mussina's enshrinement is a rarity. While almost every player is shown wearing a cap of their primary team, Mussina's plaque is logo-less. (To do so, he is pictured sideways.) Half of Mussina's career was spent with the Orioles, half with the Yankees, he couldn't choose between the two, so without a logo he went.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Jew or Not Jew? Well, we often profile people of mixed Jewish and goyishe heritage, and have to make a hard decision on the verdict. (Hence the intermediate \"Borderline Jew\" and \"Barely a Jew\" options.) Somewhat like the Hall of Fame's selction of caps. Sort of.\n\nAlas, as far as Jew or Not Jew is concern, Mussina does not really present us with a dilemma. He is 1/64th, even if that one great-great-great-great-grandfather, the one where the Mussina name came from, was a son of a Polish rabbi. So, he qualifies as \"Barely a Jew\". Barely.\n\nNow, for the important choice... which hat do we go with for the picture? As you see, we chose the Yankees. Not like there is a picture of Mussina in a yarmulke!",
