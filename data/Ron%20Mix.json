  "description": "What was the profession of Ron Mix, the man known as the \"Intellectual Assassin\"?\n\nWas he an erudite Talmudic scholar, who doubled as an underground boxing champion?\n\nWas he a brilliant surgeon, who became a lethal fighter pilot during the war?\n\nWas he a secret agent, who took out heads of state by day, and by night, filled up steamy boudoirs not only with ecstasy-filled screams of fallen damsels, but also with readings from Kant and Nietzsche?\n\nOh! The real Ron Mix had a Juris Doctor degree while playing for the San Diego Chargers in the 1960s, on the way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nWell, that makes sense too.",
