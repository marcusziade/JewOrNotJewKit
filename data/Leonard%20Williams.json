  "description": "In our other hobby as sports bloggers, we sometimes talk to non-American athletes. Some of them express bewilderment at the trade system prevalent in American sports. The ability for teams to control the lives of players at will... (Compared to the rest of the world, where they just sell players?)\n\nIn any case, the trade system is a tad absurd. Let's escape the sports world; say you work for... Microsoft. You're a good, experienced software developer (to pick a random job). At some point, your boss decides that you're not good enough and trades you to... oh, we don't know, Coca-Cola for a fancy college graduate and future considerations. And you know to move cross-country from Seattle to Atlanta, ruing the day that you decided to go into software. It's not like you have a choice. What are you gonna do, retire?\n\nSeems absurd, but it happens in American sports all the time. Players (and their families) are uprooted on management's whim, often without any indication that something is afoot. Sometimes it works out, for the player or the team. Sometimes not.\n\nWhich brings us to NFL defensive end Leonard Williams, who is Halachically Jewish. He was once a highly-touted Pro Bowler who was stuck on the dead-end New York Jets. They recently traded him... to the dead-end New York Giants.\n\nAt least he didn't have to move!",
