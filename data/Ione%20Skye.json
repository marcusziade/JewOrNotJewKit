  "description": "We watched \"Say Anything...\" the other day (mainly for the surprisingly Jewish Ione Skye, whose career pretty much began and ended with that 80s teen classic).\n\nLet us quickly rehash: Lloyd (John Cusack) is in love with Diane (Skye). He is an underachiever with no life goals. She is pretty, super-smart, and kind (if she has a flaw, it's that she is introverted). Somehow, the two click. Her father (John Mahoney) does not approve. There is a giant boombox. That's pretty much it.\n\nBut here is the thing that got us: we should have identified with Lloyd. After all, here's someone trying to obtain — and then does obtain — that impossible dream girl. Yet, we identified with... Diane's father.\n\nTo see the young lovers stay out all night. To see the precious daughter go out with someone so clearly beneath her. To see everything she worked for crumble in a heap of hormones... The poor, poor father...\n\nClearly, this can only mean one thing:\n\nWe're old.",
