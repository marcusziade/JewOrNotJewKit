  "description": "Seth Green's first major role was as a young Woody Allen (\"Joe\") in Radio Days. Since then, few actors have had as wide a variety of roles:\n\nPatrick Dempsey's younger brother in Can't Buy Me Love\nDr. Evil's estranged son in the Austin Powers films\nA pathetic hip-hop wannabe in Can't Hardly Wait\nA witch-dating werewolf in Buffy the Vampire Slayer\nA hotshot starship pilot in the video game classic Mass Effect\nPeter Griffin's idiot son on Family Guy\n\nAnd yet, the Jew-dometer is stuck at 1.\n\nThis is a travesty. How can you have a name like Seth Benjamin Gesshel-Green (with parents Herb and Barbara for Hashem's sake), and choose all these vildechayas over nice Jewish roles.\n\nNormally, this is the kind of snub we'd go all K2 over, but since Robot Chicken is all kinds of awesome (and there isn't a character in that list above that we didn't enjoy) we're letting it go.\n\nThis time.",
