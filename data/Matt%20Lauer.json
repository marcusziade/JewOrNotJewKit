  "description": "We didn't go to a diverse high school. In our class, even all the Asian kids were Christian. But, as any high school, we had our share of cliques. The jocks. The nerds. The cheerleaders. The goths. The visigoths. The choir.\n\nAnd they all swooned over Matt Lauer. Even some of the teachers. And  the gay guys. Of course, since the school wasn't diverse, there weren't any gay guys... Officially. But we had our hunches.\n\nWe had no hunch about Lauer. He seemed to be a perfect specimen of WASPy female worship.\n\nOf course, back in high school, we didn't run JONJ. We didn't try to find out whether everyone is Jewish. We had bigger problems. Like, having one of those girls look at us for a change.\n\nBut why harp on about our high school years? They are long gone. And, perhaps, one of those girls who gave us the cold shoulder back then will visit JONJ and find out that the object of their affection was really half Jewish.\n\nOr maybe they won't. We honestly don't care. It's high school. We're long over it.\n\nClearly.",
