  "description": "We've profiled a Jewish snowboarder and (somehow) not one, not two, but three Jewish surfers. A Jewish skateboarder? It's about time!\n\nIt can't be just any Jewish skateboarder, of course. Plenty of Jewish kids have taken to the streets without achieving much. (We might even be related to some of them...)\n\nWell, Alan Gelfand was not just any skateboarder. He invented a rather famous foundational trick, when the rider and the board go airborne without the use of hands. It pretty much laid down the groundwork for modern skateboarding. The trick is even named after him; no, it's not \"the Alan\" or \"the Gelfand\". (That last one doesn't exactly flow off the tongue.)\n\nIt's named after Gelfand's nickname... The ollie.\n\n\nfunction flip() { setTitleOnly('Ollie Gelfand'); }",
