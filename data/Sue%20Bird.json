  "description": "Now HERE'S the Jewish women's basketball player.\n\nOur Rebecca Lobo flub was clearly the result of too many late night pastrami binges. After all, how can one confuse the wonderfully named Ms. Lobo with the also wonderfully named Ms. Bird?\n\nOf course, there's tradeoffs. Sue's only half Jewish, thanks to her father. She doesn't exactly identify as Jewish, thanks to her Christian mother. She's an Israeli citizen, but only to circumvent Russian basketball's stringent foreigner requirements for team rosters.\n\nBut she is sort of a Jew... and one of the greatest women's basketball players of all time.\n\nHere's to that.",
