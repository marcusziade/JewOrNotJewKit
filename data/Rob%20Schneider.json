  "description": "To say Rob Schneider is ugly is an understatement.\n\nTo say Rob Schneider is funny is an exaggeration.\n\nTo say Rob Schneider is the most unlikely leading man in America today is spot on.\n\nSo if you're a Hollywood producer, and you can't get Ben Stiller, and you can't get Adam Sandler, and you keep sliding down on the Jewish actor/comedian scale, and you're wise to stay away from Pauly Shore, you get Schneider. And then you try to convince yourself that he is gritty if not ugly, and that he is amusing if not funny. And then you get \"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo\".\n\nBut we are not Hollywood producers here. And if Schneider is good enough to headline movies of dubious quality, he is good enough to be on this website... of dubious quality. Even with part-Filipino roots. Hell, we've already profiled Ben Stiller, we're soon gonna tackle Adam Sandler, and so far we've been wise enough to stay away from Pauly Shore.\n\n(Editor's update: The male gigolo has discovered Jesus...)",
