  "description": "Who created G-d? Certainly a question pondered in many college dorms during smoke-filled nights.\n\nJust don't ask the Catholics. We just did (through Google), and the first response, via catholic.com, said \"the question 'Who created God?' is nonsensical\". Stop asking, inquisitive minds! He was always there! Yeah, but... Didn't you hear?! Stop asking!\n\nThis brings us to Henri Bergson, a Jewish French philosopher and Nobel laureate in Literature, who dared to ask. According to Bergson, G-d created himself during the process of creation. As good an answer as any, if you ask us (or stoned college students).\n\nJust don't ask the Catholics! They banned Bergson's books because of blasphemy. Lame, lame, lame.\n\nMan. The answer is man.",
