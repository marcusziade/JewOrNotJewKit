  "description": "The mid-1920s into the late 1930s is considered the Golden Age of Grand Prix Racing. Automobile technology exited its infancy and started to be built for speed. Just take look at that car! Isn't it adorable?\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind that wheel is Rene Dreyfus, a Frenchman who was quite a star on the circuit. Some of his success was due to a rather simple innovation: Dreyfus outfitted his car with extra fuel tanks so he could race without stopping. Competitors could not comprehend that one man could stay in one car for such a long time. (Those who have been on family cross-country road trips are probably agreeing...)\n\nIn the late 1930s, the Nazis began to take over the circuit, with Dreyfus one of the few challengers to their dominance. When World War II came, he became a truck driver (what else!) in the French Army. In 1940, the French sent him to the US to compete in the Indy 500, and advised him to stay. Dreyfus did, and then joined the American Army to go back to Europe and fight the Nazis.\n\nBesting Nazis on the racetrack and the battlefield...\n\nThat was one bad ass Jew.",
