  "description": "Can we trust Fidel Castro?\n\nYes, this is what this comes down to. Can we trust Fidel Castro?\n\nHe sure looks trustworthy, doesn't he? With that grandfatherly beard and that spark in his eyes... Tell us a story, uncle Fidel. Will you?\n\nWell, one story uncle Fidel might tell is of his ancestry. You see, he says that he is descendant from marranos: Spanish Jews who converted to escape persecution. So if you go back, back, back,... back, back, back in Castro's family tree, you might just find a Jew. Who converted. But a Jew nonetheless.\n\nSounds plausible, be it a tad far-fetched. So should we trust Castro? What if he doesn't agree with the verdict? We don't live in Cuba, so it's not like he can throw us in jail...\n\nCan you trust us, Fidel?",
