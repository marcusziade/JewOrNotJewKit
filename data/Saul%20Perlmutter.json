  "description": "The universe is expanding. We knew that. We were fine with it.\n\nHere's something we didn't know: the universe's expansion is accelerating. All the time. By the time you finish reading this sentence, the rate has increased already. Granted, it was a long sentence.\n\nThe world of science didn't know this either, until it was proven by Nobel Prize winners Saul Perlmutter (Jew), Adam Riess (Jew), and Brian  Schmidt (they can't all be Jews). They got the Physics Nobel for it in 2011.\n\nSo where does this lead us? How long will this go on? If the universe expands faster and faster, when will it all end? Will it never end? Or will it reach some critical point where it can no longer expand, and then... what? WHAT?\n\nWhat's next, universe?",
