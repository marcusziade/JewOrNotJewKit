  "description": "Elissa Slotkin, freshman congresswoman from Michigan, is supposedly one of the bright new voices in the House. She worked for the CIA and the Department of Defense under Bush and Obama, she speaks Swahili and Arabic, she served three tours in Iraq and was the senior advisor for US's Iraq policy. Representing a very purple district, where she lives on a 400-acre family farm, she is doing her best to bridge her diverse constituents. And, yes, she is Jewish.\n\nWait... 400-acre family farm? Jewish? That's a strange combination!\n\nJewish farmers might seem oxymoronic, but they do exist. Elissa's grandfather, Hugo Slotkin, moved from New York to Michigan and bought the farm (literally, not figuratively). Hugo was probably better known as the head of Hygrade Food Corporation, the meatpacking company that  introduced Ball Park hot dogs to Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers, and then to the rest of America. It is not clear if Hugo's farm was used to source the hot dogs. (Surely, he did not raise pigs?)\n\nJewish farmers: almost as common as Jewish congresswomen!",
