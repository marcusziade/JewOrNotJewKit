  "description": "Salamo Arouch's boxing record was approximately 238 wins, two draws, and one loss. We say \"approximately\", because no one can say for sure how many bouts Arouch fought.\n\nIn his youth, Arouch was a Greek middleweight champion. When World War II came, he enlisted in the Greek Army, was captured by Nazis, and, as a Jew, was taken to Auschwitz. There, Arouch fought.\n\nHe fought fight after fight, to the delight of the German guards. He fought, knocking out fellow prisoners, knowing that a win would mean some rations, while a loss would mean certain death. He fought... over 200 times. He never lost.\n\nArouch survived Auschwitz, immigrated to Israel, where he finally suffered his one and only loss. Thankfully, the consequences of that defeat were not as dire. His life was even made into a movie, starring Willem Dafoe.\n\nArouch lived a long life, dying at the age of 86. And while as fantastic as his story sounds, it leaves us sad. Arouch might have won those 200 fights in Auschwitz...\n\n200 Jews lost.",
