In my day...\n\nSo the Golf Hall of Fame took subjectivity out of the way. If you won 30 tournaments, including two majors, you were in. If you didn't... tough luck!\n\nAmy Alcott had the majors part easily covered: in 1991, she won her fifth. That was also her 29th win of all time, meaning she was one away. For a close to a decade, she chased that elusive 30th title, but her age and the increased quality of competition made it an impossibility.\n\nDon't fret, dear readers! In 1999, the rules were changed, replacing wins with a point-based system. Alcott easily qualified, making her the first (and only) Jewish Golf Hall of Famer.\n\nYou know who is also in the Golf Hall of Fame? Somehow, George H. W. Bush! Wake up the decrepit sportswriters...",
