  "description": "Jewish opera fans, have we got a treat for you!\n\nTired of all the goyishe operas? Then take a look at \"The Jewess\" by Fromental Halevy! Jewish themes, Jewish composer, and yes, oh so Jewish title!\n\nAnd it's not just some opera; \"The Jewess\" is one of the most proclaimed operas in history! It has been produced all over the world for close to 200 years!\n\nThe opera tells of the impossible love between the title Jewess and a goyishe prince. The woman's Shylockian father, Eleazar, condemns the love, but when the tryst is revealed, both are arrested by the Cardinal. They can be saved by only one thing: conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe two refuse and are led to their death. After the Jewess is executed, Eleazar reveals the terrible truth: the Cardinal was the woman's real father. He is then executed. The chorus sings, \"We are avenged on the Jews!\". That's your Jewish opera!\n\nThat's your Jewish opera? With a Jewish composer? He didn't convert or anything? Really? We are avenged on the Jews? \n\nMaybe you should stick to the goyishe ones, Jewish opera fans.",
