  "description": "The Star-Ledger is dead.\n\nAs of February of next year, the print edition of Tony Soprano's once-favorite paper will cease. Established as the Newark Daily Advertiser in 1832, it will not quite make it to 200, moving its operation fully online.\n\nIt's not alone, of course. Countless newspapers across the world are reducing print days at best, or shutting down at worst. Well, not at worst. (Spewing political propaganda and/or being written by bot farms is the worst, which is what many still-alive newspapers are doing.)\n\nSome will rue the demise of newspapers, but we're not exactly shedding a tear. There is absolutely no way anyone born in this century will ever purchase one, much less have it delivered to their house. News has evolved to move online, and that's mostly for the best. (Again, propaganda and bot farms.)\n\nStill, let's pour one out for our Star-Ledger, here represented by its columnist emeritus, Jerry Izenberg. The esteemed writer covered over 53 Super Bowls, wrote 13 books, and is considered one of the biggest boxing authorities in the country. (Muhammad Ali was one of his closest friends.) Izenberg continues to write to this day...\n\nIt will just no longer be for the Star-Ledger.",
