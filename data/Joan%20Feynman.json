  "description": "Last year (that would be 2021), scientists finally discovered what causes the Northern Lights, also known as aurora borealis. It was in the news and everything. \"Physicists discover origins of Northern Lights\": can't argue with that headline.\n\nExcept... didn't Joan Feynman do the very same thing, all the way back in the 1970s? Last we checked, that's a tad earlier than 2021?\n\nJoan, sister of Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman, deduced that Northern Lights were the result of solar wind coupled with electromagnetic activity. It's right there in her obit: \"Joan Feynman (1927-2020), astrophysicist who explained the aurora borealis\", if you want to go by headlines!\n\nApparently, last year's scientists actually simulated auroras in a lab. Fine, we'll admit, that's pretty darn cool, but doesn't Joan deserve some credit?\n\n\"Scientists prove Joan Feyman's theory about the origins of Northern Lights.\"\n\nIsn't that a better headline?",
