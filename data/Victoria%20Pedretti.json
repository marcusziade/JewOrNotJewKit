  "description": "We were watching the new season of \"You\", because that's pretty much what we do nowadays (in case you can't tell with profile after profile written about yet another show on whatever the streaming service d'jour is), when we wanted to look up if the lovely actress playing Love Quinn was Jewish. One problem: we did not know what her real life name was.\n\nWell, duh, we can google it, of course, but here lies a problem. SPOILERS! We start typing in \"you love quinn actress\" and next think we know, Google will try to autocomplete it with something that foretells her fate on the show, such as \"you love quinn dead\". (We've been burned by this.) So that's no good.\n\nWe can go to IMDB or Wikipedia, of course, and quickly navigate to the page for \"You\", and see who Love is played by, but we must be very careful to not see more details. Even the number of episodes she appears in might be a clue! (We've been burned by this.) So that's no good.\n\nWe can just binge the rest of the show and then no spoilers can harm us. Sure, but how long is that gonna take? All we want to know is the name of the actress who plays Love! If only she had a Jew or Not Jew profile!\n\nIt's Victoria Pedretti, and she is Jewish, even bat mitzvahed! Sorry for the spoilers.",
