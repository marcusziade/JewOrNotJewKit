  "description": "The Cleveland Browns just had their best season in recent history (they were under .500, but when you've won a grand total of one game the previous two years, it doesn't take much), and quarterback Baker Mayfield is collecting all of the accolades. Sure, he was good, but there was another major factor in the Browns' turnaround.\n\nThe kicker!\n\nSure, the Browns started winning in 2018 when Mayfield entered the lineup in week 3, but, coincidentally or not (we're gonna say \"not\", for reasons that will become abundantly clear if they aren't already), that was also the week they got a new kicker. The incumbent managed to miss five kicks in the first two games, costing Cleveland victories in both.\n\nIn came Greg Josesph, a Jew from South Africa, and the Browns started to win. (Well, they continued to lose a bunch too, but at least they were respectable the rest of the way.) He acquitted himself well, hitting over 85% of his kicks, including an overtime winner versus Baltimore.\n\nSo, step aside, Mayfield, and share the glory! We guess firing that idiot head coach helped too...",
