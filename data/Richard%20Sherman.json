  "description": "Let us guess. You've come to our website to find out if Richard Sherman is Jewish. Of course, he is!\n\nSherman was born in New York City. His parents were Al and Rosa Sherman, Russian Jewish immigrants. Al was a composer and songwriter who worked alongside the likes of George Gershwin.\n\nRichard and brother Robert followed in their father's footsteps and became songwriters in their own right. The Sherman Brothers were long-time collaborators with Walt Disney, penning the scores for Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and others. \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", \"It's a Small World After All\"? That's the Sherman Brothers for you.\n\nIn fact, we're rather confused how can anyone think that Richard Sherman is NOT Jewish.\n\nOh... This was published during the Super Bowl. You mean this Richard Sherman. Duh.\n\nnfl = false;\nfunction flip() {\nnfl = !nfl;\nif (nfl) {\n memorize();\n setImage('richard_sherman');\n setRatings(0, 0, 4);\n setVerdict('Not a Jew');\n setSubhead('March 30, 1988 \u0026mdash;');\n} else {\n remember();\n}\n}",
