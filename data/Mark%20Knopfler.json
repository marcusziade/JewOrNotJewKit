  "description": "Over the years, Mark Knopfler has been one of the most requested profiles. According to our readers, he's \"one of the finest guitarists of our time\", a \"great musician, songwriter and composer\", a \"music legend\", and just plain \"awesome\". Oh, and \"a proud Scot... who happens to be Jewish\". Can't forget that.\n\nThat is all terrific, and doesn't even mention Knopfler's authorship of \"The Princess Bride\" score... but neither of those are the reasons we're profiling him today.\n\nMark Knopfler has a dinosaur named after him!\n\nThe Masiakasaurus, species name masiakasaurus knopfleri, is a small (about the height of an adult human!) predatory theropod dinosaur, whose remains were found on Madagascar and named after Knopfler. No, he didn't discover him. The name was given by the expedition crew who enjoyed Knopfler's music.\n\nAny other Jews with dinosaurs named after them? Send it in, dear readers, and you wouldn't have to wait years for a profile!",
