  "description": "We've spent a lot of time defending various fictional characters and their creators at this site. Characters like, say, Watto or Dr. Zoidberg aren't anti-Semitic unless we allow them to be. And we're more than happy to have our (only slightly above average) noses tweaked by the Mort Goldmans of this world.\n\nAfter all, laughing at ourselves is part of what fuels this site in the first place (that and about six rods of weapons-grade, Glatt kosher plutonium).\n\nSo does that mean Howard Wolowitz from The Big Bang Theory gets the ol' free pass? Please. We're soft touches, not soft in the head.\n\nUnlike the big blue bug or the pink squid/lobster thing, Howard is confirmed, locked-in Jewish. And, oy, does he wallow-itz in his own filthy stereotype. Lives with his mother, perverted, geeky, lonely, disgusting... He's even the dumb one â€” the other characters are all doctors while Wolowitz must settle for a masters degree.  \n\nThis is not someone joking around, making fun of Jews, ha ha. This is someone who is propagating that this is who Jews are and (sorry kids) that is a load of complete and utter bullshit.\n \nThat Howie was created by a Jew so self-hating (Chuck Lorre) that he can't even bear to have his real name (Charles Michael Levine. Come get some) spoken in public? \n\nYeah, that just says it all, doesn't it?\n\nFeh.",
