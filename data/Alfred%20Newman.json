  "description": "The Newmans are a very musical family. The three brothers, Lionel, Emil, and Alfred, were all incredibly prolific.\n\nLionel was a conductor, pianist, film and TV composer, 11-time Oscar nominee, one-time winner. Emil was a renowned music director and conductor. Alfred was the most prominent: he scored over 200 movies, and was nominated for 45 Oscars. FORTY-FIVE. Until John Williams passed it in 2006, that was the all-time record. From 1938 to 1957, Alfred scored at least one nomination every year, including four in 1940 alone.\n\nAlfred wasn't just nominated: he won. He took home nine Oscars in total, the third highest number of all time.\n\nIt doesn't end with the three brothers. Their nephew, Randy (his father, Irving, was the only Newman not to go into music; he was a doctor), is a favorite of Pixar (and beyond), and has multiple Emmys, Grammys, and Oscars to his name. And then there are Alfred's children: David, who scored over 100 films and has an Oscar nomination, Maria, a critically-acclaimed classical composer, and Thomas, with 75 films, 13 Oscar nominations... but no wins.\n\nJews?\n\nLionel, Emil, Alfred, Randy: yes. David, Maria, and Thomas: raised in their mother's Christian faith.\n\nCan't win them all...",
