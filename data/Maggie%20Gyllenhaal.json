  "description": "Ah, Sweden. The land of Bjorn Borg, lingonberries, Pippi Longstocking, and easy-to-assemble furniture.\n\nAnd, apparently, Swedenborgianism.\n\nNow, don't ask us what exactly Swedenborgianism is. It's hard enough for us to tell the difference between Baptists and Anabaptists. But, apparently it has about 30,000 members around the world. We wonder how many of them can spell \"Swedenborgianism\". Thank G-d for the handy copy-and-paste feature.\n\nAnyway, those 30,000 Swedenborgians include director Stephen Gyllenhaal, the father of Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal. However, Maggie's (and Jake's) mother is a Jew, which makes them half-Jewish, half-Swedenborgians.\n\nJewdenborgians?\n\nHmmmm.",
