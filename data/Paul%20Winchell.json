  "description": "Take a look at the \"See Also\" section below, specifically: Robert Jarvik, Alexandre Horowitz, Shari Lewis, and Gargamel. How do they connect to Paul Winchell?\n\nJarvik is best known as the inventor of the artificial heart. However, Winchell can lay claim to the invention himself, even holding a patent before Jarvik did.\n\nHorowitz invented the electric razor. Winchell invented its counterpart, the disposable razor, back in 1963.\n\nLewis was one of the best-known puppeteers and ventriloquists in America. So was Winchell, who hosted numerous kid TV shows through the 1950s and 60s.\n\nGargamel needs no introduction. Winchell provided our favorite animated villain's voice. He also voiced Tigger of Winnie-the-Pooh fame.\n\nWinchell also invented something called the \"invisible garter belt\"... Alas, we couldn't find any links to go with that one.",
