  "description": "The woman pictured on the left lived a life of many twists and turns. She was known by many names: Ursula Kuczynski, Ursula Beurton, Ursula Hamburger, Sonja Schultz, Ruth Werner...\n\nBorn in Berlin, Ursula Kuczynski started out as a librarian before a change in careers saw her traverse the world: China, Russia, Switzerland, England. She eventually returned to Germany... make that East Germany. Ursula/Sonja/Ruth was a spy.\n\nHer biggest claim to fame came during her residence in London. The renamed Ruth Werner was the handler of scientist Klaus Fuchs, a member of the Manhattan Project and a key contributor to the creation of the hydrogen bomb. With Ursula's/Sonja's/Ruth's help, he sold his knowledge to the Soviets.\n\nBy the time Fuchs was outed, Ursula/Sonja/Ruth returned to her now-communist homeland and became a... children's author.\n\nBet you didn't see that twist coming.",
