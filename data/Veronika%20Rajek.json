We don't have to zoom in, do we? Because we can zoom in! Anyway, we'll get back to that.\n\nVeronika is a Slovak model who has a rather large... following on various social media platforms. Unfortunately, some of her profiles keep getting deleted. We'll let her explain:\n\n\nPeople don't even believe I exist. It's pretty discriminatory that other women can do the same thing as me and I can't, and I just get deleted because of my looks. They think I'm an AI robot or a catfish online. People say beautiful people have it easy, but I have it worse as people make it harder for me because I'm beautiful.\n\n\nHorrible problems, we know. The only way to prove she is real is to meet in person! Veronika, our email is at the bottom of the page. Please reach out and schedule a meeting at your convenience. We'll even travel to Slovakia!\n\nHowever, we're pretty sure that Veronika is real. No AI robot would ever be created with a Star of David around its neck!\n\ncp = 1;\nfunction loadPic(x) {\n y = x;\n if (x == null) {\n  cp++;\n  if (cp \u003e 5) cp = 1;\n  y = cp;\n }\n document.getElementById(\"vr\").src = 'img/other/vr/vr'+y+'.jpg';\n}",
