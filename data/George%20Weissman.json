  "description": "\"The Man Who Invented Miller Lite Was a Communist\", the headline said. If that was clickbait, consider us fish.\n\nThe man is question is George Weissman. In 1972, he was visiting Munich, and, obviously, wanted a beer. Unfortunately, he was on a diet, so a waiter recommended a diet pilsner. \"Why don't we have that in America?\", thought Weissman.\n\nSome people would have just let the thought fly by, but not Weissman. It helped that he was the chairman of Philip Morris (his other contribution: the Marlboro Man), who just acquired the Miller Brewing Company three years earlier. So back to the America Weissman went, and soon Miller Lite was born. Hooray for tasteless beer!\n\nAs for the communist part, starting in the 1940s, Weissman was investigated by the FBI for his ties to various party members. It even continued into the 1970s... perhaps the Nixon administration saw light beer as a communist menace?\n\nWell, we can't say for sure that Weissman was a communist. So let's see if \"The Man Who Invented Miller Lite Was a Jew\" will serve as good clickbait for us...",
