  "description": "Don't look now, but there might be a new Jewish soccer star on the horizon.\n\nYeah, we know, we always get our hopes up when Jews and soccer mix, and it almost always fails to live up to expectations. (Once again, a quarter of David Beckham does not really count.) But Oscar Gloukh? Maybe?\n\nGloukh, who was born in Israel from Russian Jewish parents, was scouted as a teenager by the one and only Barcelona. Unlike many in his situation, Oscar decided not to rot on Barca's bench. Instead, he chose to sign with Red Bull Sazlburg, a known pathway club to further glory. (If only Red Bull paid similar attention to its New Jersey-based team.) Gloukh played so well that he has now attracted interest from Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal... and he is barely 20.\n\nGloukh will now have a chance to show his skills for Israel at the Paris Olympics. If that goes well, who knows what the limit is.\n\nAre we getting our hopes up?",
