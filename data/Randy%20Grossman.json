  "description": "What's the secret to building an NFL dynasty? No, it's not drafting well, managing the salary cap, or avoiding injuries.\n\nJews.\n\nYes, that's right, the secret is Jews. Don't believe us?\n\nIn the Super Bowl era, two teams can lay claim to being dynasties: the Steelers of the 1970s and the 49ers of the 1980s and early 90s. Two others come close, and we'll get to them.\n\nThe Steelers had a Jew on its four championship teams: tight end Randy Grossman. The 49ers five titles were spread over the longer period, but Jewish tight end John Frank got two rings and Jewish tackle Harris Barton followed up with three. Seeing a trend?\n\nBut what about the Cowboys of the 90s and the Patriots of the 2000s? Close, but no cigar. Three titles for each, and failure at more. The Cowboys did have Alan Veingrad, a backup offensive lineman, for one title... Maybe if they kept him, they would have gotten to four. The Patriots? They had a Jew on the 2005 champions, punter Josh Miller, but let him go soon after. The best they can do since then is Julian Edelman, and he isn't exactly helping.\n\nSo, NFL general managers, now that the secret is out there, you know what to do. Better snap up Sage Rosenfels, we're telling you...",
