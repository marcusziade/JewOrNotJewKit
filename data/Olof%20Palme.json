  "description": "On a cold winter night in 1986, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme was walking home with his wife from an evening at the movies. Someone emerged from the shadows and fatally shot Palme from close range. Nobody knows who or why.\n\nThat's right; the identity of Palme's murderer remains a mystery even today. And so do the reasons behind the killing. Years and millions have been spent trying to figure it out... The investigators are as clueless now as they were in 1986.\n\nTheories? Theories are many. They range from South African racists to Kurdish communists to Chilean fascists to Swedish drug addicts to Yugoslav secret service. And, if you really want to scrape the bottom of the barrel...\n\nDepending on what nonsense you want to believe, Palme was either killed by Israelis for his pro-Palestinian stance, or... he was secretly Jewish himself, killed by... Palestinians? Antisemites?\n\nYeah, that's just pure hogwash. That we know.",
