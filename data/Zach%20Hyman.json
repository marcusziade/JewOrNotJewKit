  "description": "Zach Hyman just made his NHL debut recently, so we have no idea how his career will go. As far as Jewish hockey players go, the sky is the limit, right?\n\nIn any case, Hyman had a very respectful time in college, was named University of Michigan's athlete of the year across all sports, and did well enough in his first professional season in the minors to earn a call-up to the Toronto Maple Leafs. But if his NHL career doesn't go according to plan, Hyman will always have a backup option.\n\nHe is a successful children's author.\n\nHyman has a deal with Random House, and managed to publish a children's book at the age of 20. Another one followed, and he has two more in the pipeline.\n\nProfessional athlete? That dream died a long time ago.\n\nPublished author? Some of us are jealous...\n\n(Editor's update, 2024: Since moving to Edmonton, Hyman became a star, the first Jew to score 50 goals in an NHL season! He no longer needs that backup option...)",
