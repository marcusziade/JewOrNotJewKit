  "description": "Tonight, on When Good Surgeries Go BAD!\n\nA young actress coming off a string of successful films. A promising career ready for liftoff. A nose that speaks a bit too much of her Jewish heritage...\n\nA trigger-happy surgeon! A rhinoplasty going horribly wrong! A second surgery needed to fix the first!\n\n\"I went in the operating room a celebrity â€” and came out anonymous. It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible.\"\n\nA transformed young woman. An unrecognizable face. Friends are shocked. Family is appalled!\n\n\"I remember going to a restaurant where I had been going for years. I ran into people I knew and would say, 'Hey.' Nothing.\"\n\nA life altered. A career ruined. A lifetime of regrets.\n\n\"I'll always be this once-famous actress nobody recognizes... because of a nose job.\"\n\nA beauty... Or a beast?\n\nafter = false;\nfunction loadPic() {\nafter = !after;\nif (after) setImage('grey');\nelse setImage('j/jennifer_grey');\no = after ? 2 : 4;\nsetRatings(4, o, 3);\n}",
