In Europe!)\n\nThat being said, the history of Jews in San Marino dates back to the 14th century. They were allowed to live there (which can't be said about other European countries), but were subject to various restrictions.\n\nSo based on all of the above, it wasn't exactly easy to find a notable Jew from San Marino. Well, Angelo Donati wasn't from San Marino per se, but he did serve as the country's general council for seven years. Born into a prominent Italian family, he spent World War II in Vichy France, helping to save Jews from the Nazis.\n\nSome of those Jews ended up in San Marino, which served as a harbor during the war for both Jews and anti-fascist Italians.\n\nMost have left since, be it by bus or taxi...",
