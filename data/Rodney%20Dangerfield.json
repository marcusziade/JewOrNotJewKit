  "description": "For the life of us, we don't understand why any Jew would want to join a country club.\n\nJews don't play golf. Jews don't own yachts. Jews don't spent thousands of dollars a year for the privilege of eating brunch in a pristine setting.\n\nIs it to wear pastel colors in public? Unlikely.\n\nNo, we can think of only one reason for Jews to join a country club: to annoy its goyishe members.\n\nSo when they give you no respect, and try to ostracize you, and make you hang out with Chevy Chase, you know you have succeeded.\n\nSo throw down your golf clubs, scream \"We're all gonna get laid!\", and get out of there.\n\nAnd don't come back for the sequel.",
