  "description": "As one of the unwritten rules on our little website, no athlete can ever get an O Score of 5. As a reminder, the O Score rates how Jewish people look and act. And no athlete — especially a successful one — fits that Jewish stereotype.\n\nWell, we might have a case with US Olympian Aly Raisman.\n\nFirst of all, she is a gymnast, and there is definite precedence with successful Jews there, from Agnes Keleti to Kerri Strug.\n\nSecond of all, she looks rather unmistakeably Jewish, and has a Jewish name to boot.\n\nThird of all, outside of sport, she is your classic overachiever in school... making her Jewish parents oh so proud.\n\nFinally, she does her floor routine to \"Hava Nagila\".\n\nYep... As you watch Aly perform in these Olympics, she'll be on the floor to the sounds of the most Jewish of all music.\n\nSo, could this be it? Our first athlete to get an O Score of 5?\n\nNah. Who are we to break our own unwritten rules...",
