  "description": "We've been watching the 1990s X-Men animated series recently (because that's what we do now, watch decades-old cartoons), and must say that it's pretty fantastic. Its depiction of anti-mutant sentiment eerily parallels the current anti-immigrant sentiment... but we digress. We're going to talk about two episodes we DIDN'T like.\n\nThe first episode stars Mojo, an alien who kidnaps the X-Men to star in a television show. Mojo is an utterly disgusting, ginormous space slug. \nHe is so fat that he can't walk, instead relying on robotic spider legs. \n\nAnd then he says: \"Bubbale.\"\n\nWe thought we misheard, so we rewound, and there it was:\n\n\"Bubbale.\" Is the disgusting, ginormous space slug Jewish?\n\nClearly, we have to use the Gargamel Law here, as outside of that word, no other evidence exists. So we are gonna rule Not a Jew: Mojo, who is his planet's top TV producer, is just imitating Earth's best producers... who are obviously all Jewish.\n\nThe other episode we didn't like?\n\nThe one where Wolverine learns the spirit of Christmas.",
