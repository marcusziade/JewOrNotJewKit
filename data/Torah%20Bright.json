TORAH!\n\nThat's Torah Bright, Australia's snowboarding sensation, flying to an Olympic gold medal.\n\nTORAH! TORAH! TOR...\n\nAh?\n\nNo... not Jewish. Not even with that name. Devout Mormon. No alcohol, smoking, or even drinking tea or coffee. And no sex before marriage, of course.\n\nSo much for getting us so excited.",
