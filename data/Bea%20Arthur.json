  "description": "For years, Bea Arthur, star of \"The Golden Girls\", harbored a secret.\n\nA secret so terrible that she denied it every time she was asked.\n\nA secret so awful... Well, let's get straight to it.\n\nAnd no, the secret wasn't that she was Jewish. Everyone knew that. Her birth name was Bernice Frankel, and she was the original Yente in Broadway's \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nNo, the secret was... She was a truck driver in the marines.\n\nYep. The truth came out after her death, when military records were uncovered. Then-Bernice was actually one of the first women to enlist. In the records, she was called \"over aggressive\" and \"argumentative\" (we already mentioned that she was Jewish, right?) and listed her hobbies as \"piano\" and \"bow hunting\".\n\nAn over aggressive, argumentative, piano playing, bow hunting, truck driving Jewish marine... Come to think of it, it kinda makes sense that she kept it a secret.",
