  "description": "Dear angry feminists,\n\nPlease stop writing our website.\n\nWe know there are many Jewish women who have had a much larger impact on the world at large than, say, Alicia Silverstone or Sarah Michelle Gellar. \n\nBut whenever we get the urge to profile one of them, an even stronger urge points us towards yet another Jewish starlet. In fact, as early as this morning we were looking at Jewish Playboy centerfolds. Purely for research purposes, we swear.\n\nWell, no more. Thanks to your letters, we are turning over a new leaf. We will be serious from this point on. We will give Jewish women their due. Important Jewish women! Jewish women that matter! And no one associated with Playboy will ever appear on our website again.\n\nAfter this profile.\n\nThanks for voicing your concerns,\n\nJew or Not Jew",
