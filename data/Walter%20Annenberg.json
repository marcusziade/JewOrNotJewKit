  "description": "Television is getting ridiculous nowadays. We have no idea where to find anything!\n\nOh, sure, everyone knows \"Stranger Things\" is on Netflix and \"Ted Lasso\" is on Apple, but what if you want to find something a tad more obscure? Perhaps a film you missed and want to know what service it's on? Or maybe you're out of things to watch and want a recommendation?\n\nDon't be dense! There are numerous websites which help with such a thing!\n\nOh, sure, there are, but how do we know which of those websites to visit? There are so many of them...\n\nWell, back in the day, there was the beacon that was TV Guide. (Walter Annenberg, the newspaper publisher who started the magazine, is profiled here. He also served as US ambassador to the UK under Nixon.) That's right, to find out what was on TV, you had to purchase an actual magazine! (Or, failing that, hope for one of those folded-in attachments in your Sunday paper... Oh, and Sunday papers were... Anyway, where were we!?)\n\nAs absurd as that sounds, how about this one: TV Guide is still printed to this day. Yes, in the year 2022, some people actually pay money for a paper copy.\n\nTalk about ridiculous...",
