  "description": "Here at JONJ, we strive to bring out the hilarity of Jewish obscurity. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we don't. And all is well. For on what other site will you see back-to-back discussions of Dr. Seuss and Bejamin Disraeli? Yakov Smirnoff and Sarah Jessica Parker? Gargamel and Fidel Castro? Jesus Christ and Leonard Nimoy? Well, maybe that last pair...\n\nYet sometimes, it's wise to take a step back from the uproarious laughter and supposed creativity and be serious, if only for a moment.\n\nAnne Frank. The girl and the diary.\n\nIt's been over 60 years. She is long gone, so is the war, and soon everyone who experienced it will be gone too. But memories remain. And the diary remains. And if... if there is just one person who picks it up and starts thinking, and understanding, as we know thousands and thousands have already done... We can't think of anyone more deserving of the perfect JONJ rating.\n\nWe can now go back to our regularly scheduled programming. Paula Abdul, anyone?",
