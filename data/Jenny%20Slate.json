  "description": "It's been a long time since we had a Jewish leading lady on Saturday Night Live. Not since the days of Gilda Radner; all the women who could claim the \"leading\" title, from the terribly unfunny Molly Shannon to the delightful Amy Poehler, were all goyim.\n\nToday's leading lady is one-note goy Kristen Wiig, who apparently can do no wrong. Kristen gets choice role after choice role, does her stupid voices, rolls her eyes, and poor Jenny Slate stays in the background.\n\nYes, poor Jenny Slate. The same Jenny Slate who wrote her name into SNL annals by saying \"fuck\" on her first show. IN HER FIRST SKETCH. The same Jenny Slate who has more talent in the tip of her oh-so-Jewish nose than Wiig has in her entire body. And no, we're not just saying that just because Slate is Jewish.\n\nBut it doesn't hurt.",
