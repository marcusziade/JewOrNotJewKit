  "description": "In the Elisabeth Shue profile, we joked about the old ESPN commercial in which Shue's brother was traded for Charley Steiner. How silly is that!\n\nWell, Al Michaels was traded for a rabbit.\n\nMichaels (yes, Jewish) is quite possibly the best sportscaster in the country. He will forever be remembered for calling the Miracle on Ice game, and his steady presence in the Monday Night booth brought gravitas to the NFL's weekly showcase (which is rather hard to do when a large chunk of that time was shared with the buffoonish Dan Dierdorf).\n\nIn 2006, Michaels decided to follow then-partner John Madden to NBC, leaving Monday Night Football behind. But he was still under contract with ABC, so the deal had to be struck. In the end, Disney, who owned ABC, received broadcast rights to a golf tournament... and a rabbit.\n\nBut not just a rabbit. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, created by Walt Disney himself, but whose rights belonged to NBC.\n\nThe trade worked out for both sides. Michael continued to call football, and even got back into the Olympics, now controlled by NBC. Disney got back a part of their heritage, which they immediately put on t-shirts and made into toys.\n\nYou can't do that with a sportscaster, can you?",
