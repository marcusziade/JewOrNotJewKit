  "description": "Here's something very frightening you don't ever expect to see:\n\nThe Hitler mustache.\n\nWe saw one the other day. Yes, a real Hitler mustache on a real human being. It was really scary.\n\nNot because we thought the guy wearing it was some kind of a Nazi. It was because it proved that an actual human being made the decision to grow one! (Yes, we know that Michael Jordan was wearing one recently. He was probably trying to start some kind of fad.)\n\nNo, this was no fad... This man actually came to the conclusion that the Hitler mustache was the way to go. How? Why? It's called the HITLER mustache, for crying out loud!\n\nOf course, prior to Hitler's rise to power, the mustache was pretty popular. Heck, the one-time Prime Minister of Israel, one of people responsible for the creation of the Jewish state, Levi Eshkol, had one! But to grow one today?\n\nFrightening.",
