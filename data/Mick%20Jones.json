  "description": "Punctuality. It's something we've tried to instill in our children from day 1. And... it's difficult.\n\nHow does one explain to a five-year-old that one has to be on time? We're five minutes late for kindergarten, so what? The teacher will still welcome the kid with open arms. Meanwhile, the poor parent must make the mad dash up the highway to make that early morning meeting...\n\nMaybe we need to use real-world examples. Take Mick Jones, a founding member of The Clash. He was fired from his own band. The major reason? He wasn't punctual!\n\nOf course, then we would have to explain who Mick Jones is (probably mention that he is Jewish), and what The Clash was. That will lead to us explaining punk rock, and turn into a never-ending conversation that all these chats with a five-year-old tend to become...\n\nLet's just hope this discussion doesn't make us late for something!",
