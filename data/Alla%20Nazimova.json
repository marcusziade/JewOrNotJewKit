  "description": "Did you know that in the 1920s, the Garden of Allah was the center of Hollywood debauchery? Wait, \"Allah\"? Is that right?\n\nMake that the Garden of ALLA. Russian-born actress Alla Nazimova turned her residence into a hotel, which became the place to be for the Hollywood elite. What happened in the Garden, stayed in the Garden... and much happened. It wasn't for the meek.\n\nNazimova was more than just an actress. First a top draw on Broadway, with a namesake theater, she then became one of Hollywood's early women pioneers. On one film, she served as a director, producer, editor, lightning and costume designer (as well as acting, of course). Her most famous role was as the titular Salome in a 1923 adaptation of an Oscar Wilde play.\n\nThe Garden of Alla was somewhat a misnomer, actually. Nazimova's real name was Marem-Ides Leventon; her parents were Jewish merchants. Of course, the Garden of Marem-Ides doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.\n\nNazimova eventually sold off her hotel, and it was renamed... the Garden of Allah. Is that right?",
