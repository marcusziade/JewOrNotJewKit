  "description": "Let's get this straight: Perdue has nothing to do with polluting the nation with its addictive product. Its product is actually not addictive at all.\n\nBefore the angry emails: don't be confused. We're talking about Perdue, not Purdue. Oh.\n\nPerdue, not Purdue, with a \"E\" (we swear we corrected this mistake twice in this profile already), is a family-run company. You might remember Frank Perdue, pictured here, for his television ads. (The baton has since passed to son Jim, who is sadly not as memorable.) Perdue, AKA Perdue Farms, makes chicken products. (Also turkey and pork?) And, regardless how you feel about its flavor-induced chicken (it's a thing!), is not addictive at all.\n\nPurdue, not Perdue, with a \"U\", is also a family-run company. You might remember... no, not anyone named Purdue, which was apparently a middle name of some long-forgotten doctor who founded it. The Sackler family has owned Purdue, AKA Purdue Pharma, since 1952. It is greatly responsible for America's opioid epidemic due to its production of highly-addictive OxyContin. Apparently, the company is now bankrupt and is trying to rebrand itself Knoa Pharma, which is too little, too late.\n\nAnd, sadly, while Frank Perdue and his family are not Jewish, the Purdue... err, Sackler family is. We got that right? No mix-up?\n\nDammit.",
