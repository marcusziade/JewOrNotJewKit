  "description": "We jest about the French a lot on this website, but it's all in good fun. They are so fascinating! After all, how can one not be intrigued by people who wear berets, enjoy mimes, and eat frogs. Frogs! Oops, here we go again.\n\nThe recent French presidential election was quite fascinating as well. In it, socialist Francois Hollande defeated incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. And to win his party's nomination, Hollande trumped Segolene Royal, who lost to Sarkozy four years ago... and was Hollande's wife for 30 years.\n\nYes, you heard that right. In France, the current president won an election over his ex-wife. (Actually, they were never officially married. Despite living together for three decades and having four children, they considered marriage too \"bourgeois\". Oh, the French!)\n\nIn any case, you're probably wondering if Hollande is Jewish. No, he isn't, even though there are rumors to the contrary. Of course, the French are a tad sensitive about Jewish rumors. Recently, a French anti-discrimination organization sued Google for trying to append the word for \"Jew\" — \"Juif\" — as search suggestions.\n\nThey should stick to eating frogs.",
