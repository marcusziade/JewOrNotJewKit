  "description": "A horse is a horse, of course of course, but how do you know if he's Jewish?\n\nIt's fairly easy, actually. What you need to do is manually check for circumcision. Start by kneeling down next to a calm, male horse. Then, using your left hand, reach for the shaft and...\n\nNAH, we're just kidding. The real way to find out if a horse is Jewish is to ask him. Well, that's what works in Mr. Ed's case anyway. Sort of.\n\nYou see, Mr. Ed was voiced by Allan \"Rocky\" Lane, who was not a Jew. But, Ed's singing voice was Sheldon Allman, who was Jewish (unless you're talking about Ed's singing voice in the opening theme which was voiced by a different person altogether... G-d, this is complicated).\n\nAnyhoo, since Ed was kinda sorta voiced by someone Jewish we're more than happy to agree that Mr. Ed was kinda sorta Jewish, himself. Kinda.\n\nMore importantly, though, we have to feel for poor Sheldon. Really, having to put \"Mr. Ed's Singing Voice\" on a resume? That can't be good for one's ego.",
