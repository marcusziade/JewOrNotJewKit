  "description": "Dear Ann Landers,\n\nWe are the writers of a semi-popular website entitled JewOrNotJew.com in which we rate the Jewishness of various celebrities and historical figures. It's a good time.\n\nIn any case, we're not writing you to ask if you are Jewish.  Nor are we curious about your twin sister and competitor Abby, nor her daughter who replaced her. We know that you are all Jews and we're proud to have you.\n\nNo, you see, recently we've been wondering something about our chosen profession/obsession: Is it polite for us to be doing this? After all, whether someone is Jewish or not really is none of our business. Are we being rude for pointing it out? By searching the Internet for evidence of Jewishness are we, in fact, doing something improper? \n\nPlease let us know at your earliest convenience. We could not continue without your sage advice. â€” Guilty in Greenwich\n\n\nCan you believe she never wrote us back? How rude.",
