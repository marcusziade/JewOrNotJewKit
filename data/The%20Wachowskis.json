  "description": "Can we all just agree that the Wachowskis are... not that good?\n\nSure, they had The Matrix, which is beloved by most (some of us do not rate it, but, fine, we'll let it be). But what about the sequels? It's just best to pretend those never happened.\n\nV for Vendetta was pretty cool, sure. Yet you will note that was one movie of theirs that the Wachowskis did NOT direct (they did screenwrite and produce).\n\nOnce we get past that, what do we have? The unremarkable, inane Speed Racer? The incomprehensible, boring Cloud Atlas? Their newest, the convoluted, derivative Jupiter Ascending?\n\nLots of ambition, but rather meek results. Oh well. We wouldn't even defend them if they were Jewish... they are just not that good.",
