And, no, he is not Jewish... but why does someone who looks like THAT have such a high O Score?\n\nIt has to do with his nickname: Paul \"Bearjew\" Craig. What gives?\n\nWe see two options here: either Paul picked the nickname as homage to Eli Roth's character, the baseball-bat-wielding soldier from Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglorious Basterds\", who was nicknamed \"Bear Jew\"... or because he resembles a giant Jewish bear.\n\nFrankly, we just don't see it.\n\nfunction flip() { setTitleOnly('Paul \"Bearjew\" Craig'); }\nfunction loadPic() { showDiv(null, 'bear'); }",
