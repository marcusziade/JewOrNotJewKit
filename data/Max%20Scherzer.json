  "description": "\"Max\" is not exactly a Jewish first name. Sure, there are many Jews named Max, but there are many goyim with that name as well.\n\n\"Scherzer\" is not exactly a Jewish last name. Sure, there are many Jews named Scherzer, but it comes from German for \"jester\", so it could be goyishe as well as Jewish.\n\nNow put it together and you get \"Max Scherzer\", and...\n\n WHAT IS IT WITH THOSE EYES?!?!?!\n\nAh. Scherzer was born with heterochromia, which means his eyes are of different color. Another famous person with the condition is Elizabeth Berkley of Saved By The Bell fame. Now where were we...\n\nPut it together and you get \"Max Scherzer\", who sounds like a Jewish professional accountant, not a goyishe professional baseball player.\n\nMaybe if he went by his full first name, Maxwell, we wouldn't be fooled so easily.",
