  "description": "Internazionale Milan, Inter for short, has been one of Italy's famed soccer clubs for over a century. Their first title win came in 1910; their last, in 2010. Good symmetry.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 30s, Inter was managed by Arpad Weisz. A former Hungarian national player, he finished his career with the club and switched to coaching. Weisz led Inter to the title in 1930.\n\nThat time proved turbulent for Inter; for one, it was forced to change its name. With Mussolini rising to power in Italy, the name of the club was deemed too communistic, and was changed to Ambrosiana. (It was restored after the war.)\n\nWeisz then switched to Bologna, winning two championships, before being forced to leave Italy because he was a Jew. He went to the Netherlands, got a job there, and then the Nazis came, and that was that. Weisz perished in Auschwitz.\n\nToday, those who remember Weisz think of him as one of the great innovators of early soccer. As for Inter Milan, some of their supporters are among the worst in Italy, filling the stadium with racist and antisemitic chants and banners.\n\nThis story is just sad.",
