  "description": "Ah, the perfect 15. So hard to get. So elusive. We last awarded one three years ago, when Herman Wouk was a sprightly 101 years old.\n\nWelcome to the club, Herman! The Pulitzer Prize winner for his famed opus, \"The Caine Mutiny\", he is one of the most celebrated American authors of all time.\n\nHow can we even think of denying him the perfect score? Wouk is undoubtedly Jewish, penning novels about the Holocaust, as well as books designed to explain Judaism to the fickle goyim.\n\nAnd, yes, still kicking it. Now at 103, he is three years removed from publishing his last book. If that's not worth the perfect score, we don't know what is...\n\n(Editor's update, May 17, 2019: No longer kicking it. RIP, Herman.)",
