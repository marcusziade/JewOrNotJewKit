  "description": "According to some, gymnast Elena Shushunova had a disappointing Olympic career.\n\nYou see, she was one of favorites in 1984, but the Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles Olympic precluded her from competing.\n\nAnd then, in 1988, she was the favorite on both vault and floor exercise, and faulted on both.\n\nSo, Shushunova had to settle. She got the silver on the balance beam, and a bronze on uneven bars. Oh, and a team gold. Oh, and the all-around gold as well.\n\nYes, a Russian Jewish girl became the Olympic all-around gymnastic champion.\n\nNot disappointing at all.",
