  "description": "If you look closely, our site is full of Jewish Buddhists, from Leonard Cohen to Allen Ginsberg to... Jeremy Piven. But then there are Jewish Buddhists, and Jewish BUDDHISTS, those who truly seek the life of peace and enlightenment.\n\nSiegmund Feniger was born in Germany in 1901. In his twenties, he began to study Buddhism. In his thirties, when the Nazis came, he emigrated, but not to another European country or to America. Feniger went to Sri Lanka, took the name Nyanaponika, and became a Buddhist monk. During World War II, the British interned him in camps, because of his German birth. So much for peace and enlightenment.\n\nAfter the war, Nyanaponika embraced himself in Buddhism, rising to the rank of Mahathera (Great Elder). He taught numerous followers and wrote multiple books, including \"The Heart of Buddhist Meditation\". Nyanaponika passed away in 1994 at the age of 93 after a life of peace and enlightenment.\n\nYour move, Jeremy Piven.",
