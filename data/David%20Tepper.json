  "description": "Daniel Snyder was finally forced to sell his NFL team. So who has taken over as the worst owner in the league?\n\n(The answer, of course, is Jerry Jones. Pictures don't lie, Jerry! But Jerry will forever wear the crown, so let's find someone new to challenge for it...)\n\nIt all started pretty well for David Tepper. All he had to do was be better than the Carolina Panthers' old owner, Jerry Richardson, the asshole who was forced to sell due to racist and sexist behavior. (Again, Jerry Jones... let's just move along.) Tepper's first move as new owner was to remove a statue of Richardson from the team's stadium... and that might be the only good thing he did.\n\nTepper's tenure as Panthers owner has been an outright disaster, and we're not just talking about on the field, where he has churned coaches and turned losing record after losing record. We don't have the time or the desire to delve into his infractions, but when pouring beer on a fan is the least of your transgressions, then you have David Tepper.\n\nOf course, if Tepper ever does something so egregious that the NFL forces him to sell, like they did with Snyder and Richardson (and yet, never with Jones!), he will just become richer in the process.\n\nAnd, yes, the worst owner in the NFL is Jewish. (Can't we just go with the goyishe Jerry Jones?!)",
