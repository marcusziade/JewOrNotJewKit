  "description": "You gotta hand it to Richard Kind. When you say that one has a face for radio, well...\n\nOf course, to be on radio, you need to have a voice. And Richard Kind's voice is, well...\n\nUnique? Distinctive? Unmistakable?\n\nSeriously, name one other voice that can be identified from a single syllable! Regardless of what cartoon character is voiced by Kind, all you need is one drop of that nasal drawling cackle to know: yep, that's him!\n\nSo, we're handing it to Kind. He made it work, again again and again, be it in front of the camera or in the recording room, despite the face, despite the voice.\n\nBecause of the face. Because of the voice.",
