  "description": "So, it looks like New Girl is the new hit of the fall television season (thus shattering the inverse hype law in the process). Well you know what that means: time to make sure one of the characters is Jewish! Cause Hashem knows you can't have a successful TV show without a Jewish character in there, right?\n\nSo, who should it be, hm? Well, Zooey Deschanel's Jess is out cause, well, let's be clear — we'll have a black, female unicorn president before that kind of character is made a Jew. \n\nAnd obviously, the black roommate isn't Jewish. So that leaves us with the good looking dumb one and the shlubby former lawyer who yearns for the girl but never gets her. And we all know where this is going. So congrats you paunchy bast...\n\nWaitaminute. They chose the other guy? Yes, Schmidt — chiseled like a rock and dumb as one as well — was revealed to be Jewish in a recent episode. Bar mitzvahed and all. And we wish him a hearty l'chaim on it. That's how you explode some stereotypes, gosh darn it!\n\nOf course, he's also the rich one. So, ummmm, yeah. Guess we still have a ways to go. Small steps, people. Small steps.",
