  "description": "If you were a child in the late 1990s (we weren't, but we heard stories), you couldn't escape the phenomenon that was Air Bud. Oh? You don't know Air Bud? He is the dog who played basketball!\n\nThe setup is simple: Josh sucks at basketball. But his dog, Buddy, is really good at it! (No, Buddy doesn't palm the ball, don't be ridiculous! He uses his nose to loop it into the hoop.) You see, Buddy was previously owned by a clown... the details are not really important. What you need to know is that because there are no rules preventing dogs from suiting up for middle school basketball, Buddy joins the team and helps them win the championship. (If you're really curious, the full movie is freely available on YouTube. You're probably not curious.)\n\nThe movie proved so popular that there were sequels made where Buddy played football, soccer, baseball and, somehow, volleyball. (But not hockey, because putting a dog on skates would just be a tad too silly.) One would think that the adults in the Air Bud universe would be aware of canine prowess and amend the rule books to prevent cross-species involvement in athletic activity. Apparently, not.\n\nIn any case, Kevin Zegers, who played Josh, was... not Jewish. But he is Jewish now, converting after marriage. In the past two decades, he's been in a bunch of movies and TV shows, but...\n\nNone of it compares to the phenomenon of Air Bud?",
