  "description": "Lilly King, Lilly King, Lilly King, Lilly King! This is all we heard at the women's 100 meter breaststroke at the Tokyo Olympics. Lilly King!\n\nIt made sense, of course. King is the world and Olympic record holder, and the defending gold medalist. And she is American, so NBC latched on to her like a bloodthirsty leach. Lilly King!\n\nLydia Jacoby?\n\nWhen the dust... err... waves settled, it wasn't King who won the gold; she settled for the bronze. It was Jacoby. NBC was surprised as well; Jacoby, even though she is also an American, was such an afterthought that her name wasn't mentioned until she came from the back to pull off the massive upset.\n\nAnd with the medal came the questions. Jacoby... could she be?\n\nShe isn't. And, just so we got it covered: Lilly King isn't either.",
