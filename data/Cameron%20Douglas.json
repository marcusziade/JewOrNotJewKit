  "description": "In our recent foray to profile three generation of Jews, we settled on the Katzes... Greys... Katz-Greys: Mickey Katz, Joel and Jennifer Grey. But wasn't there an even more famous Jewish Hollywood dynasty? We distinctly remember watching a movie with three generation of Douglases...\n\n\"It Runs in the Family\", 2003! (Apparently, they play Jews in the movie as well: the Grombergs.) Just like in real life, Kirk is the grandfather, Michael the father, and Cameron the son. (The other son is played not by a Douglas, but by a Culkin; not that Culkin or that other Culkin, but Rory Culkin.) In the film, Michael is following Kirk's footsteps (not as an actor, but as a lawyer). Cameron is struggling with a drug problem. The movie bombed.\n\n\nWhat happened to Cameron after that? Well, if you look at his IMDB page, you will see a decade-long gap between 2009 and 2019... because, as life imitated art, he spent seven years in prison for drugs. He emerged with two giant tattoos on his torso: the faces of Kirk and Michael.\n\nIt runs in the family!",
