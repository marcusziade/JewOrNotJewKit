  "description": "Ten years ago, one penalty kick goal, one thrown jersey, one black sports bra, and US women's soccer player Brandi Chastain became a household name.\n\nAnd so did her World Cup-winning teammates: Mia Hamm, already with a major following among the nation's young girls, became a national brand. Julie Foudy was now in TV commercials, selling piss water known as Bud Light.\n\nBut what about Sara Whalen (that was her hugging Chastain on the cover of Time)?\n\nFor Sara, there were no line of sports bras, no big advertising dollars, and no beer commercials.\n\nAnd why exactly is that? She was as much a part of that team as the aforementioned trio!\n\nNow, to be fair, even though Whalen played in that World Cup final, she wasn't a starter. But who do you expect us to defend, the team's token Jew, or someone like Kristine Lilly?",
