For example, back in 2008 we kvelled over a Jew that married Christina Aguilera... well, they are now divorced, so that whole profile is pretty much moot.

Well, soon after writing that, the number dropped all the way to zero. (We hope none of you became Cowboys fans.)\n\nSo, what's the Jewiest team in the NFL as of this writing?\n\nWell, it's Chicago! The Bears now lead the pack with two NFL Jews, lineman Gabe Carimi and punter Adam Podlesh. Actually... make that three.\n\nHe might not be a player, but we have to count the head coach, right? The Bears just hired Marc Trestman, the NFL's first Jewish head coach since Marv Levy retired in 1997.\n\nBut we're not kvelling over Trestman just yet. We don't want another Aguilera...",
