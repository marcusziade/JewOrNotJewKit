  "description": "The first movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Heathers\". Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, teenage angst, and murder. A terrific start, isn't it?\n\nThe second movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Meet the Applegates\". No one has ever heard of it, so let's move on.\n\nThe third movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Hudson Hawk\". Oh boy... Bruce Willis as a singing cat burglar. The CIA is involved. It's... not good.\n\nThe fourth movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Airheads\". Brendan Fraser, Adam Sandler, and Steve Buscemi as failed musicians. Alright. Could be worse.\n\nThe fifth movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"The Truth About Cats \u0026 Dogs\", a modern Cyrano de Bergerac adaptation with Uma Thurman and Janeane Garofalo. Uninspiring.\n\nThe sixth movie Michael Lehmann directed was... \"My Giant\"! This is not going well for Mr. Lehmann.\n\nThe seventh movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"40 Days and 40 Nights\", where Josh Hartnett swears off sex for, well, 40 days and 40 nights. What a tragedy, right? Moving on.\n\nThe eighth movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Because I Said So\", an awful family drama in which Diane Keaton raises three daughters... The end is in sight.\n\nThe ninth movie Michael Lehmann directed was \"Flakes\". Apparently, Zooey Deschanel plays someone named \"Pussy Katz\". Ahem.\n\nThat was Michael Lehmann's last movie.",
