  "description": "Dear writers of \"Cobra Kai\",\n\nAdmit it. You read Jew or Not Jew. You want us to write profiles of your characters. How else do you explain it?\n\nFirst, you introduced Eli Moskowitz: clearly, obviously Jewish. But he was not exactly a very important character, at least in the early seasons, so we didn't profile him. You had to get more clever.\n\nThen, you made Johnny Lawrence have a Jewish stepfather. Fine! Johnny Lawrence, the goyiest of the goys. Fine! We profiled Johnny Lawrence!\n\nBut did you have to convert Terry Silver? Terry Silver, the diabolical villain of \"Karate Kid 3\" who now sneers his way through the latest two seasons of your series. Terry Silver, who is told by another sensei — word for word — \"This is not the deal we made at Shabbat services\". Terry freakin' Silver is a Jew? Fine! Here is your profile! We hope you're satisfied!\n\nNext season, can you just get it over with and have Daniel LaRusso finally discover that his mother was secretly Jewish?",
