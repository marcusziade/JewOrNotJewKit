  "description": "If you were going to imagine a Jewish football player, what position would he play? Of course, Jews can play anywhere, be anyone, but if you were thinking in a stereotypical sense, what would you choose?\n\nQuarterback, with the image of the Jewish intellectual certainly fits, but there's only two right now (Jay Fiedler, Sage Rosenfels).\n\nHard to picture a Jewish running back or wide receiver. And just about any position on defense seems to require a certain viciousness not commonly associated with Moishes and Mordecais.\n\nWhich leaves us with only one choice. Offensive Lineman. \n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, there's actually a good number of them. Including the large mensch pictured here, currently with the Cleveland Browns, former Viking Mike Rosenthal, and several others.\n\nYes, it may be hard to picture such a lumbering lineman as a landsman, but apparently it's where we belong. Protecting the better known, goyishe quarterback from getting thrown down on his little toosh and hurting himself. No, it's not glamorous, but it's admirable. So it kind of fits in a weird way. If you squint really hard. Kind of.\n\nOh, and punter Josh Miller is also Jewish. So there ya go.",
