  "description": "The Great American Novel of the 20th Century.\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\", by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\", by J.D. Salinger.\n\"Catch-22\", by Joseph Heller.\n\nThat's pretty much the short list. One might add Ernest Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\", or our personal choice, Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five\", but you can't go wrong with the original trio.\n\nWell, we have no chance with Fitzgerald. We had Salinger, but lost him to a mixture of Scientology, Buddhism, and urine therapy. Heller, on the other hand, is all Jew.\n\nOne small bone to pick with Heller, however. How come he didn't make John Yossarian Jewish? Here was his chance to finally create a memorable Jewish protagonist, and he blew it.\n\nBut that's all right. Yossarian might be Armenian, but \"Catch-22\" is still an all-time classic. And we promise that when we write the Great American Novel of this Century, we'll make the protagonist Jewish.\n\nDon't think we have it in us?\n\nJust you wait.",
