  "description": "Who should be considered Jewish, British actor Ben Kingsley or British actor Kingsley Ben? (Make that Kingsley Ben-Adir.)\n\nAs profiled years ago, Ben Kingsley has mixed ancestry. It's possible, although hasn't been proven, that his mother was part Jewish. It seems incredibly unlikely that he considers himself Jewish.\n\nAs profiled today, Kingsley Ben(-Adir) has mixed ancestry. His Black English mother converted to Judaism,  even changing their surname to something Hebrew. Supposedly, but not proven, Kingsley followed suit.  So it seems incredibly likely that he considers himself Jewish.\n\nBut JONJ! If Ben Kingsley has Jewish ancestry, especially on his mother's side, you must consider him a Jew! You can't put converts like Kingsley Ben-Adir on the same level!\n\nSure, but...\n\nBut JONJ! If Kingsley Ben-Adir converted to Judaism, you must consider him a Jew! Who cares if he doesn't have Jewish ancestry, you can't put obvious goyim like Ben Kingsley on the same level!\n\nIf you don't think we'll get emails like these, then you haven't followed this website for the last 18 years.",
