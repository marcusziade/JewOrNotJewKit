  "description": "The Winter Olympics are upon us! So, just like we did for the Summer Games two years ago, get ready for a week full of Olympic Jews to be profiled! And here we go!...\n\nWinter Olympic Jews, Winter Olympic Jews... Let's see... Hmmm. Oh boy.\n\nDo Jews play ANY of these sports? Biathlon? Nothing with guns, thank you. Skeleton? Freestyle skiing? Curling? Nordic combined... what the hell is combined? Oh, it's cross country skiing with ski jumping. Terrific. Just another weekend outing in the Katz household. NOT.\n\nAh, here we go. Figure skating. Gotta have some nice Jewish children who got pushed by parents into figure skating. But we already profiled Sasha Cohen, and... hmmmm... well...\n\nOh come on! Winter Olympic Jews???\n\nHere, got one. Ice dancer Benjamin Agosto, half Jewish. That's ice DANCER. Ballet on ice. Yes, they actually give medals for this. He and his beautiful-but-not-Jewish partner, Tanith Belbin, got a silver in Turin for years ago and are favored to medal again in Vancouver.\n\nHmmmm. On second thought, we might have to scrap Winter Olympics Week. Let's call it Winter Olympics Day and leave it at that.",
