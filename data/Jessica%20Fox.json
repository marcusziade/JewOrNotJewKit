  "description": "A year ago, it was reported that hockey player Andre Burakovsky is Jewish. So we profiled him, thinking we have a Jewish hockey dynasty: Andre's father also played in the NHL.\n\nWell, it turned out that the Burakovskys are just barely Jewish, meaning we had to look elsewhere for Jewish sports dynasties: canoeing!\n\nWe have to look at a different gender as well. Jessica Fox of Australia has multiple world championships and two Olympic medals: silver from London and bronze from Rio. Her mother, Myriam Fox-Jerusalmi, who competed for France, has multiple world championships as well, and an Olympic bronze, from Atlanta.\n\nJessica's father and Myriam's husband, Richard Fox of Britain, brings even more world championships to the family table, although he just missed on his own Olympic medal. But he isn't Jewish, so we just have to settle for the mother-daughter pair.\n\nNow we just need for Jessica to settle down and give birth to a canoeing child to give us a multi-generational Jewish athletic dynasty. Surely, that's not too much to ask?\n\n(Editor's update, July 29, 2021: And now a gold and a bronze from Tokyo for Jessica!)\n\n(Editor's update, August 5, 2024: Another two golds in Paris! She is the first one ever, woman or man, with six canoe/kayak medals. And then, sister Noemie won kayak cross to further the family legacy!)",
