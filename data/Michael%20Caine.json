  "description": "Our grandparents spoke fluent Yiddish to each other.\n\nOur parents could understand it.\n\nWe know a few words.\n\nOur children... we doubt it.\n\nYiddish is certainly a dying language. Sure, we have Hebrew, but it just can't match Yiddish's grotesque beauty. Schmendrik. Schmaltz. Schnorrer. Schmutz.\n\nOf course, speaking Yiddish doesn't make one Jewish. Take two-time Oscar-winning British actor Sir Michael Caine. Grew up in a Jewish neighborhood. Fluent in Yiddish. Yet, not a Jew.\n\nWell, at least he could tell grandpa to pass the gefilte fish.",
