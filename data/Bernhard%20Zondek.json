  "description": "Say you need to figure out if you are pregnant. (Half of our reader base is shaking their head.) Alright, say someone needs to figure out they are pregnant! You (someone) head to a pharmacy and buy a pregnancy test. Then you (someone) urinate on that test and it tells you (someone) if you (someone) are pregnant or not. Easy peasy! At least that's how they do it in the movies.\n\nThe pregnancy test has been around since the late 1920s, when it was first developed by German Jewish gynecologists Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek. (Americans Maurice Friedman and Maxwell Lampham often get the credit, but come on! German Jews FTW!)\n\nOf course, back then it wasn't as simple as heading to a pharmacy to buy a pee stick. Aschheim and Zondek injected urine into mice, and if the woman was pregnant, the mouse's ovary got enlarged. Obviously, not something you (someone) can easily do at home, and yet, the groundwork of a world-changing invention!\n\nHow did they figure out if you (someone) were pregnant before Aschheim and Zondek? You (someone) know... better not to think about it.\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nif (x) {\n remember();\n} else {\n memorize();\n setImage('selmar_aschheim');\n setSubhead('October 4, 1878 \u0026mdash; February 15, 1965');\n setVerdict('Jew');\n setTitle('Selmar Aschheim');\n}\n}",
