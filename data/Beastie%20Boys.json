  "description": "We owe some people an apology.\n\nIn a number of profiles, we've been complaining about the lack of cool Jewish rock stars. Madonna doesn't count. Lenny Kravitz is sort of OK. Dylan converted. David Lee Roth would have been great 20 years ago. Barbra Streisand is so abhorrent we haven't even bothered to profile her yet... \n\nWell, we'll be the first to admit it: we blew it. Because mensches and mamales, we forgot all about the Beastie Boys.\n\nIn every way we could have wished — talented, popular, controversial —\nthe Beasties make the grade. And boy oh boy are these boys Jewish. Oh, sure, you're not gonna bump into one of them at oneg, but otherwise these are no-doubters. \n\nWe're just sorry we didn't notice them until now.\n\nNo! Sleep! Till Temple!!!",
