  "description": "Have you ever wondered why they don't give the Nobel in mathematics? It seems to be such an obvious omission.\n\nWell, it's because Alfred Nobel's wife had an affair with a mathematician. This was his way to pay back the lot.\n\nSo what are poor mathematicians to do? Forever doomed because of one indiscretion?\n\nWell, some luck out, and, because of crossover of disciplines, get the Nobel in Economics or Physics. Most have to settle for various other accolades.\n\nSo no, Benoit Mandelbrot, the man pretty much responsible for fractal geometry (heck, he coined the word \"fractal\"!) never won the Nobel. Oh sure, he received numerous other awards, but the big one forever eluded him. Thanks, Alfred Nobel's wife's lover!\n\nWait a second! Turns out that whole rumor is bogus. Alfred Nobel never had a wife.\n\nSo why the heck is there no Nobel in mathematics?",
