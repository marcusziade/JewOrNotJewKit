  "description": "Tutta Jew is not really a Jew. She is a Tuttujew? We're confused already.\n\nRaili Marjatta Pekkala was born in Finland, in the delightful-spelled city of Pieks\ufffdm\ufffdki. She came from a family of singers, with younger sister Rauni rising to fame in the 1960s. Not to be outdone, Raili performed herself, and even toured the United States... under the name Tutta Jew. We're still confused.\n\nAs far as we can understand, Raili got the name Tuttujew through marriage, and then decided to split it up as her performing pseudonym. Obviously, \"Jew\" in Finnish doesn't mean what it does in English. It's even pronounced differently (to our best comprehension, something close to \"Yev\").\n\nAnd yet, she toured America in the 60s with the name Tutta Jew. Did she visit any southern states?\n\nHer audience might have been mightily confused!",
