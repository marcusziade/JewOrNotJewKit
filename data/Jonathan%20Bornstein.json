  "description": "When Mexican businessman Jorge Vergara bought a team in Major League Soccer, he did so with a boast.\n\nHe would fill a team with Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, and they will show Americans how to play f\ufffdtbol.\n\nA year, three head coaches, and one of the worst records in league history later, Vergara was no longer boasting.\n\nSo Chivas USA, as they were regrettably called, scrapped the original plan. They've had a bit more success since then, but it's not so easy to find a Mexican on their roster.\n\nExcept for Jonathan Bornstein. You wouldn't know it from his name:  Bornstein is Jewish on his father's side. But his mother is indeed Mexican. And now with Jonathan playing a major role not just with Chivas but with the US national team...\n\nWhat's that? Bornstein converted to Christianity? Ay, qu\ufffd l\ufffdstima!",
