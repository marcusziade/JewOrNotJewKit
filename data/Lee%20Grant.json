We know that she was born on October 31, but the year — 1925? 1927? 1929? — differs depending on the source. Lee tried to keep the real age hidden as she tried to keep working in Hollywood.\n\nSpeaking of working in Hollywood, that close-to-ten-year gap on her resume is not a mystery. After being nominated for an Oscar for her first movie role, in 1951's \"Detective Story\", Lee was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee.

She starred on \"Peyton Place\", for which she won an Emmy, and got that Oscar a decade later for \"Shampoo\".\n\nJewish?
