  "description": "The NFL season is about to begin, so let's profile Bears running back Tarik Cohen. In his own words:\n\n\"I'm not Jewish necessarily, but I do feel accepted by the Jewish community.\"\n\nBoy, that's a lot to dissect in such a short sentence...\n\n\"Necessarily\": Why did Tarik feel the need to add that? Is he hinting at Jewish ancestry? Or just attempting to please the interviewer? Who knows.\n\n\"Accepted\": Now, regardless of what is claimed about our website, we don't claim to speak for the Jewish community, but... who is accepting Tarik? Could you let us know, please? We'll gladly amend this profile.\n\nLet's just emphasize \"I'm not Jewish\".",
