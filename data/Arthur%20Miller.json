  "description": "We've really gotten to appreciate Arthur Miller.\n\nSTOP! Says faithful reader. What do you mean... \"gotten to\". This is\nArthur Miller! The man who bagged Marilyn Monroe, possibly the top\nshiksa of all time! The man who proved that smart Jewish boys\ncan get that impossible dream girl!\n\nDon't worry, faithful reader. We've always appreciated Arthur Miller\nthe man. It's Arthur Miller the playwright that we have newfound\nadmiration for.\n\nYou see, our first encounter with his works came in high school\nEnglish and \"Death of a Salesman\". Can a bunch of bored teenagers really appreciate the poignancy of a story about the death of hope? High school is about youth and possibility, not dead ends and regrets. \n\nBut as we've gotten older, and life has had its way with us, we've come to appreciate the emotional complexity of Miller's work and understand why Miller deserves our highest respect.\n\nOn the other hand, Thornton Wilder and \"Our Town\"? We still think that's lame.",
