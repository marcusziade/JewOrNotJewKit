  "description": "There are a few phrases to describe actress Meagan Good. One is \"scream queen\": she has appeared in numerous horror movies, where, she, well, screams.\n\nWe don't watch horror (our encounter with Meagan comes from her playing Will Ferrell's boss/love interest in \"Anchorman 2\"), so let's move on to the next phrase: \"sexy Christian\". You see...\n\nHold on for a minute here. \"Sexy Christian\"? Probably pioneered by Mary Magdalene, right? Talk about an oxymoron...\n\nYet, this is how Meagan refers to herself, so let's move on to the next phrase: \"Puerto Rican, Cherokee, Jewish and African\". This is how her ancestry is described. Now, research hasn't shown any Jews on her family tree (no Cherokee either, for what's that worth), so what do we do about the verdict? Do we trust her words or genealogy?\n\n\"Sexy Christian\", right? Well, that settles it.",
