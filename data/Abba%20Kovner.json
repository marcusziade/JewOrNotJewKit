  "description": "Have you heard of The Avengers? No, not Marvel's superhero team.\n\nPerhaps we should call these Avengers by their Hebrew name, Nokmim? Does that ring a bell?\n\nPerhaps at should. The Nokmim were a group of Jews detained in the Vilnius Ghetto. Led by Abba Kovner, they were an underground organization that tried to undermine the Nazis. When Kovner and his associates escaped the ghetto, they kept up the resistance, hiding in forests and engaging in anti-Nazi sabotage and guerrilla attacks.\n\nAfter World War II, Kovner went to Israel. There, the remains of the Nokmim reorganized into a group that hunted Nazi war criminals. And if his life wasn't full already, Kovner also became an award-winning poet.\n\nHow is that for a real-life superhero?",
