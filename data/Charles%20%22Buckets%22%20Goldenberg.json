  "description": "Charles Goldenberg was a football pioneer.\n\nA star at the University of Wisconsin, he moved on to the Green Bay Packers in 1933, where he started at running back and led the NFL in touchdowns.\n\nLater in his career, Goldenberg switched to lineman (such shifts were common at the time). As a guard, he was named to the Packers all-time team, as well as the NFL all-decade team of the 1930s. Goldenberg led Green Bay to three league championships.\n\nOn defense, he played guard and linebacker, and helped originate the draw play when Bears quarterback and fellow Jew Sid Luckman got tired of getting sacked by Goldenberg and decided to hand off the ball instead.\n\nWhat's more, Goldenberg was actually born in the Russian Empire, one of the few NFL players who can lay claim to that origin.\n\nBut, face it, if Goldenberg's nicknamed wasn't \"Buckets\", we probably wouldn't be profiling him...",
