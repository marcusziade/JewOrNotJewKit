  "description": "Ever since we started this site, one profile has been the most requested. One name has been searched for the most.\n\nAdolf Hitler.\n\nAnd for years, we resisted. Seeing Hitler's mug splashed all over our website just seems wrong. And our lowest possible score of zero just seems... too high.\n\nBut the requests keep on coming.\n\nAnd you know what? Why shouldn't we profile Hitler? After all, we're here to address Jewish rumors. And yes, one of the biggest Jewish rumors out there is that Hitler had Jewish blood.\n\nWell, those rumors are totally and completely false. Yes, there are some theories that Adolf's father wasn't his father. Or that his grandmother got impregnated by a Jew. Or that his mother had an affair with Jewish aliens from the future.\n\nAnd then there are the studies that \"concluded\" that Hitler might have had Jewish DNA. \"Might have\". Just like, according to the very same studies, he might have had African DNA. Or Spanish DNA. Or alien DNA? Yawn.\n\nIt's all such ridiculous BS. But that hasn't stopped people from trying. Repeat after us: there is nothing there.\n\nWe hope you're happy, JONJ readers. And to think, we could have spent all this time profiling Zac Efron or Darth Vader or someone else worthwhile...",
