Sure, there are many prominent, brilliant scientific Jews, and sure, Jews have won dozens of scientific Nobel Prizes, and sure,\n\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\n\nOh, it's you? Did we just drift off? Sorry, but all this science talk doesn't really get the blood pumping. Instead, it makes us think back to high school chemistry class,\n\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\n\nSorry! Sorry! Where were we? Oh yes, scientist profiles. Little did we know that one of the most requested profiles would be that of a scientist â€” Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman. Feynman was... a little eccentric, to say the least. His hobbies included juggling,  playing the bongo, and... safecracking. He frequented topless bars, and was proud of it. He became quite successful as an artist under the name \"Ofey\".\n\nAs for his contributions to science?\n\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",
