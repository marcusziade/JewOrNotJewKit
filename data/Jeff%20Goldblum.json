Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I just got prescribed glasses. They make me look like such a NERD! Girls will never talk to me... Please help!!! â€” Aaron Rubinstein, 13, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nDear Aaron,\n\nWho says looking like a nerd is so bad?\n\nLook at actor Jeff Goldblum; whenever he puts on those thick black-rimmed glasses, he either figures out how to defeat dinosaurs (\"Jurassic Park\") or save the world (\"Independence Day\"). Take the glasses away, and he either mutates himself (\"The Fly\"), or stars in unwatchable dreck (\"Holy Man\").\n\nAs for girls never talking to you... well, Goldblum did get Geena Davis, but we're pretty sure he did not wear glasses back then. So... ummm... we'll get back to you on that one.\n\nYours in prescription eyewear,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
