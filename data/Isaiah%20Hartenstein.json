  "description": "People have asked us if Isaiah Hartenstein of the New York Knicks is Jewish. Duh, no! Just take a look at his tattoo: Jesus H. Christ in all his supposed glory.\n\nHuh. You don't say? Apparently, that's not Jesus, that's Zeus. Huh.\n\nWell... first of all, isn't it quite odd that Jebus and Zeus share much of the same iconography? (Let's answer that: it's not odd at all.) And second of all, would having a Zeus tattoo preclude Hartenstein from being Jewish?\n\nWell, he is not Jewish. Goyishe German-American... and, according to himself, a \"follower of Jesus Christ\".\n\nAre we still sure that's Zeus?",
