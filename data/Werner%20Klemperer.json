  "description": "If you were to create a sitcom, what would be the LAST location you'd pick to stage it at?\n\nA nudist colony? A morgue? An old folks home? How about a Nazi POW camp?\n\nAnd if you were to cast actors to portray Nazis in that POW camp, who would be the LAST people you choose?\n\nWe'll get right to this one. Jews. You wouldn't want Nazis to be played by Jews.\n\nYet it all happened. And it wasn't just a fly-by sitcom; \"Hogan's Heroes\" ran for six years, won numerous awards, and even gave Homer Simpson a guardian angel in the form of Colonel Klink.\n\nLet's get to it: Klink, the Nazi who ran the camp, was played by a German-born Jew, Werner Klemperer. In fact, the four major Nazi characters on \"Hogan's Heroes\" were all played by Jews.\n\nHow did Klemperer reconcile the role? \"I am an actor,\" he said. \"If I can play Richard III, I can play a Nazi.\"\n\nA sitcom set in Richard III's England?\n\nNow that we'd watch.",
