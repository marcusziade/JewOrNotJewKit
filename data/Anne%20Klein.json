  "description": "If you ever watch a television show or a movie that depicts American women prior to 1970, you will notice dresses, in home or in the office. In fact, that's how you immediately know that it's a period piece: women wear dresses.\n\nStop, JONJ! Who are you to make a such a blanket statement on women's fashion! American women still wear dresses, at home and at work! You really need to stop making these generalizations!\n\nFine, you got us. Women still wear dresses... but it's less common for women to wear dresses. Can we move on, please?\n\nWhat do you mean, less common? You need to stay in your lane, JONJ, and profile some random hockey player!\n\nG-d damn it! All we want to do here is laud fashion designer Anne Klein (born Hannah Golofsky; she changed her name to Anne because she thought it was more... pleasing) is largely responsible for the female fashion revolution of the 60s. She introduced \"separates\", which... separated the dress into a top and a bottom. As fashion entered the 70s, dresses became much less the norm, especially in the workspace.\n\nYou know, Anne Klein is not the only...\n\nWe need to stop having these dialogues!",
