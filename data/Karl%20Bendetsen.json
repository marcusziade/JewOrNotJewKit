  "description": "Dear Jew or Not Jew,\n\nWe are your friends at DanishOrNotDanish.com (the country, not the pastry)!\n\nUnfortunately, we are not writing to you to revel in our common appreciation for Niels Bohr or half of Scarlett Johansson (there will always be time for that). We're writing to you about American colonel and politician Karl Bendetsen... or should we say Karl Bendetson (we'll explain soon).\n\nBendetsen is known as an architect of Japanese interment camps during World War II. He ordered anyone with \"one drop of Japanese blood\" to be rounded up. Truly, one of the worst crimes in American history!\n\nAccording to him, Bendetsen was a descendant of Danish farmers... that is simply not true. His parents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants. He changed his name from Bendetson to Bendetsen (it doesn't seem one letter will make a difference, but here we are).\n\nWe're so sorry to inform you that, our Jewish friends! This monster was not a Dane... just a self-loathing Jew.\n\nTo better times and herring,\n\nDanishOrNotDanish.com",
