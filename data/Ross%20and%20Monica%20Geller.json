  "description": "Have you ever wondered, why on Friends, Ross Geller is super Jewish, while his sister Monica is a Jew in name only?\n\nYou remember our famous James Wilson Law, right? To reiterate, it says:\n\nIf thou hast an ensemble cast of characters, one of them MUST be Jewish.\n\nBut what if somehow the creators of the show painted themselves into a corner? What if they somehow created TWO Jewish characters? Then you have a problem.\n\nYou see, middle America can't exactly take too many Jews on its television programs (this is similar to the Seinfeld \"too New York\" comment we previously discussed). Having the possibly Jewish Rachel doesn't exactly help either. So you try to play down the Jewishness (it's helps if you have a goy playing one of the Jews, like Courteney Cox and Monica).\n\nWhere does it leave us? Clearly, a high O Score for Ross, but a low one for Monica. Averaged, it all works out!\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nif (x == 1) {\n memorize();\n setImage('ross_geller');\n setTitle('Ross Geller');\n setRatings(3, 5, 3);\n} else if (x == 2) {\n memorize();\n setImage('monica_geller');\n setTitle('Monica Geller');\n setRatings(3, 1, 3);\n} else {\n remember();\n}\n}",
