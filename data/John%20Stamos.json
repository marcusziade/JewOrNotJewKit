  "description": "We love yogurt here at Jew or Not Jew. We eat it daily.\n\nWe are also men.\n\nWhy is that important? According to advertisers, yogurt in America is only eaten by women.\n\nThink about it: every single yogurt commercial features an nonthreatening, middle-aged woman. (We're looking at you, Jamie Lee Curtis!) Often, there are multiple nonthreatening, middle-aged women. They sure love their yogurt! Why don't they let their husbands try it?\n\nThere are two exceptions, both from Dannon. First, the Greek yogurt craze had them call on the Greekest of American Greeks, John Stamos (Well, the Greekest on paper; he is actually 1/8 Jewish, believe it or not.) to peddle Oikos. However, in that case the yogurt was clearly still being sold to women, who presumably would get lost in Stamos' dreamy Greek eyes... Where were we? We're men!\n\nDannon's newest attempt is to sell its protein-full Triple Zero brand through NFL star Cam Newton. So, apparently, now it's alright for men to eat yogurt...\n\nAlas, Triple Zero tastes like chalk. We'll stick with feminine yogurt brands, advertisers be damned!",
