  "description": "It's time for our first two-headed JONJ article. And after closely beating out Sonny and Cher for that prestigious title (we kid), the honor goes to the Coen Brothers: the team of Joel and Ethan Coen. So how do you tell them apart?\n\nJoel is older, Ethan is younger. Joel directs, but also produces, Ethan produces, but also directs. Joel is married to Frances McDormand, Ethan is married to someone you've never heard of. Joel has a beard, Ethan has a goatee. Yes, we know, the differences are obvious.\n\nAnd both are responsible for some of the most creative movies of the past 20 years. \"Raising Arizona\". \"Fargo\". \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\". \"Miller's Crossing\" gave us Jewish gangsters. \"The Big Lebowski\" gave us the quintessential Jewish convert, Walter Sobchak. Some say that \"Barton Fink\" can be seen as an allegory for the rise of Nazism.\n\nSo what if they are hard to separate from each other? At least it saves us from writing two articles.",
