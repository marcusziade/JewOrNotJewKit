  "description": "When the first Hunger Games movie came out, some Internet idiots was outraged. Rue was black!\n\nRue, a young girl befriended by Katniss during the games, was played by Amandla Stenberg. Why was an actress of color cast?\n\nThe answer was incredibly simple: Rue is described as dark-skinned in the books (in fact, pretty much her entire district is). If only those Internet idiots read... (Or, you know, didn't really care about the skin color of actors / fictional characters. As. If.)\n\nNow, some Internet idiots are confused about Amandla Stenberg. They think she is Jewish!\n\nWell, she is not. The -berg comes from Danish roots; she is actually part Greenlandic Inuit!\n\nThat being said... We'll take confusion over potential Jewishness over outrage over skin color. Seriously, Internet! As! If!",
