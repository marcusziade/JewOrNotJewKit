  "description": "As Jews, we like to keep some things simple. Like our names.\n\nWe have a first name, a middle name, and a last name. The middle name often coincides with our Hebrew name. Sometimes it doesn't... so the Hebrew name gets thrown in somewhere. So four names tops.\n\nIn the Hispanic world, four names is the bare minimum. Take renowned Mexican painter (and husband of Frida Kahlo) Diego Rivera. His full name is \"Diego Maria de la Concepcion Juan Nepomuceno Estanislao de la Rivera y Barrientos Acosta y Rodriguez\".\n\nWow. Try saying that three times fast. That's ten names, with two each of \"de\", \"la\", and \"y\" thrown in. 16 words. Imagine that birth certificate.\n\nSo it comes as a complete surprise that Rivera is actually part Jewish; his ancestors on his mother's side converted to Catholicism.\n\nAll those names and they couldn't find room for one Schlomo?",
