  "description": "Have you ever been to Disneyland? Then this ad should stir up some memories...\n\n\n\n\n\nStrolling down Main Street USA, high-fiving Mickey and Bugs! Oh, to go back to your childhood, when things were so simple and fun!\n\nErrr... not so much. As property of Warner Bros, Bugs Bunny has nothing to do with Disney (until the inevitable buyout, that is). And yet, when Elizabeth Loftus presented her test subjects with this very ad, a third of them were fooled, many of them insisting that they met Bugs at Disney.\n\nLoftus is the world's leading expert on false memories. Obviously, the creation of those creates numerous issues, especially when crime is involved. And when one gets to suppressed (or false) memories of childhood abuse... Well, the implication are much more severe than who you saw at Disney.\n\nFalse memories can also be collective. Many claim to remember \"Shazaam\", the 90s movie where Sinbad starred as a rapping genie. It's simply not true... the only 90s rapping genie is \"Kazaam\", starring Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nWhy couldn't that be a false memory?",
