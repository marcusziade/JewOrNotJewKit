Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, my parents don't want to buy me an iPhone. They got me some stupid cheap crap which was made in Laos or something. Can you talk some sense into them? â€” Rebecca Shapiro-Humphrey, 11, Massapequa, New York\n\nDear Rebecca,\n\nWe feel your pain. When we were your age, you know what we wanted the most in the world? A Commodore 64. Did we get one? No. Even our pleas that Commodore was founded by a Jew, Jack Tramiel, didn't help. You what we got instead? A Wang computer! A Wang, Rebecca!\n\nSee, that's the thing, Rebecca. You probably never heard of a Commodore 64. 30 years ago, they were at the top of the world, and now? They are all gathering dust in some landfill. Just like iPhones will be one day. And that day will come quicker than you think.\n\nEnjoy your Laotian device,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
