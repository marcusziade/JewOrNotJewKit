  "description": "If you browse our Athletes category on the left, you'll see that we have quite a few sports represented. There's no shortage of baseball and soccer players. We have Olympians in various sports. Our football roster might be, at this point, just rumored Jews, but it's not like it would be difficult for us to come up with a few real ones. Even hockey is represented.\n\nNot so with basketball.\n\nWe don't want to go with some obvious Jew, and profile some Israeli no one has heard of. We do not want, at this point, to profile someone like Larry Brown or Red Auerbach, who were much more famous as coaches. We want to profile a Jewish basketball player. It shouldn't be so hard.\n\nBut it is. Strange, because basketball developed in America as a Jewish sport. However, by the time it became professional, most Jews have moved on.\n\nAnd then we found Max Zaslofsky. Before Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and Shaquille O'Neal, there was Zaslofsky. Playing for the Chicago Stags, he led the BAA (NBA's predecessor) in scoring in 1948 and was named first-team all-league four straight times. He ended his career as the third leading scorer of all-time.\n\nAnd we've never heard of him until doing our research yesterday. Let's face it, we're just not big basketball fans. Even if it once was a Jewish sport.",
