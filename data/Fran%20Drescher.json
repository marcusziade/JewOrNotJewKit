  "description": "The voice. The voice.\n\nThe loud, nasal, piercing voice. So annoying that one sound of it leaves a permanent imprint in your brain. The voice. It can't be mistaken for anyone else's. The voice. Fran Drescher's voice.\n\nThe voice of a New York Jewish woman. To be fair, Drescher is not the worst choice to represent that group. At least she is, if not gorgeous, then not completely unattractive. And oh, so typically Jewish.\n\nBut it's the voice that makes her the total package. If you took the voices of all New York Jewish women, put them in a blender, and puree for a few minutes, Drescher's voice would come out. And that's definitely not a good thing... let's leave it at that.\n\nAnd the laugh. Don't get us started on the laugh.",
