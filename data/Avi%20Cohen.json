  "description": "Avi Cohen might be one of the best Israeli footballers of all time, but his career with famed Liverpool didn't really have a happy ending.\n\nCohen didn't play much in England, but somehow earned a starting spot in the ultimate game of the 1979/80 season. It wasn't just a game: Liverpool had to beat Aston Villa to win the league title. And Cohen definitely made a mark: he scored! Alas, it was into his own net...\n\nNo, this part actually ended well. Cohen then scored into the correct net, giving Liverpool the lead and eventual title. It's what followed next that was a downer: Cohen decided to play on Yom Kippur, upsetting his home country. It wasn't even worth it: a few months later, Liverpool flat our released him.\n\nCohen went back to Israel, had an excellent career, and even fathered a fellow international, Tamir. Then, he tragically injured himself while riding a motorcycle and died soon after.\n\nNo, there are no happy endings here...",
