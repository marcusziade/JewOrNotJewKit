No JewOrNotJew.com?!?!\n\nSo who do we thank for creating this amazing invention? And no, the answer is not Al Gore.\n\nIn reality, there are many people who can be considered the inventors of the Internet. But the duo with the best claim is Bob Kahn (Jew) and Vint Cerf (great name, and partially a Jew), who invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) in the early 1970s. TCP/IP made the reliable transfer of data possible between computers over a network, which led to the Internet.\n\nSo without Kahn and Cerf... No letters from Nigerian princes. No clips of Saved by the Bell. No pictures of cats doing stupid things. No thousands upon thousands of pages of porn (ok, thousands upon thousands of pages of porn, just not in digital form). No JewOrNotJew.com.\n\nThanks, Bob and Vint.",
