  "description": "The discussion of the golden age of Bond (James Bond) might never be settled (Connery? Moore? Brosnan? Craig? Surely not Lazenby or Dalton!), but as far as we are concerned, the golden age of Bond girls is a shut case.\n\nIt's the 70s. Specifically, the period between 1971 and 1977, when three of the four Bond girls were Jewish.\n\nWe had Jill St. John as Tiffany Case in \"Diamonds are Forever\". Jane Seymour as Solitaire in \"Live and Let Die\". And to top them all, the stunning Barbara Bach as Anya Amasova in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".\n\nIn real life, Bach (Jewish father, Catholic mother) married Ringo Starr. And she's still going strong after all these years, appearing in Playboy in 2008 â€” more than three decades after first gracing the pages of the magazine.\n\nThat's a heck of a lot better than what Sean Connery has been doing these days (let alone George Lazenby).",
