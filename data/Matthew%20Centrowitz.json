Isn't it time to give it a rest? The election is coming up, maybe you can come up with a Jewy angle? Or profile one of those young actresses you seem to have a never-ending stockpile of...\n\nOh, the Olympics might be over, dear reader, but our supply of Olympic Jews hasn't run empty. It's just that in some cases, like Matthew Centrowitz Jr., it took a while for the Jewishness to come out. That \"Jr\" at the end of his name was giving us fits. And the fact that he was raised Catholic did not help either.\n\nNevertheless, Matthew Jr is a quarter Jewish, making his father, fellow Olympic runner Matthew Sr, a half.
