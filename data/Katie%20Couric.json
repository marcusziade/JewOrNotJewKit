  "description": "When Katie Couric got the job at CBS, people were asking, is it finally time for a woman to be the host of nightly network news?\n\nWhat should they really have been asking, is it finally time for a Jew?\n\nNo, Katie is not that Jewish. In fact, she barely qualifies, as her Jewish mother raised her in the Presbyterian faith. If not for running this website, we would be clueless of her heritage ourselves. To say it's not obvious is an understatement.\n\nThe thing is, though, Katie is not the first woman to anchor the network news. Barbara Walters did it in the 1970s. Connie Chung failed at in the 1990s. Elizabeth Vargas did it briefly a few months before Couric was hired.\n\nBut Katie is only the second person with obvious Jewish heritage to hold that job. The other was... Barbara Walters. Hmmmm, maybe we should have profiled her instead.",
