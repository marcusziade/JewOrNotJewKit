  "description": "We often have trouble categorizing our profiles. The one category that gives us most trouble? No, not Sociopaths. It's Writers.\n\nHow does one define a writer? For example, Bill Clinton wrote a best-selling autobiography. Does that make him a writer? And what about Paris Hilton, whose not only \"wrote\" a book, but whose maxim \"dress cute wherever you go, life is too short to blend in\" was added to the The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations? Does that make her a writer? (Quick answer: No. But we really should consider her for the Sociopaths category.)\n\nAnd what about screenwriters? Wouldn't that make the Directors category completely unnecessary? For what quality director has not written a script at some point of their career?\n\nBut in the case of Oscar-winning director Billy Wilder, we have no such trouble. Born in Austria-Hungary as Samuel Wilder (Billy was his mother's nickname for him), he eventually made his way to America, where he directed such classics as \"Double Indemnity\", \"The Lost Weekend\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", and \"Some Like It Hot\".  So he's obviously listed under Directors, but also under Writers, for three of his seven Oscars came for screenwriting. In fact, with \"The Apartment\", he pulled a rare treble, winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing for the same film.\n\nAnd who can argue with his epitaph? \"I am a writer, but then nobody is perfect\".\n\nWe wish we had written that.",
