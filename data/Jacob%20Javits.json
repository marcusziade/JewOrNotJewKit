  "description": "Today, we have a bone to pick with the New York Times about something they wrote in... 1986. This is from the obituary for Jacob Javits, written by James Clarity.\n\nThroughout his career, his lack of telegenic charisma — Mr. Javits was bald for most of his adult life and was endowed with a sharp, nasal voice — posed no obstacle to advancement.\n\nWhoa there! Thank G-d his awful voice didn't pose an obstacle. And baldness! Oh, how terrible it is to be bald!?\n\nMr. Clarity, have you ever heard of Winston Churchill? Michael Jordan? Sean Connery? Let's see, this was in 1986... Mikhail Gorbachev? Oh, the shame to not have a full head of hair! The shame!\n\nDespite that awfulness, Javits served 24 years in the US Senate, and after death has lent his name to a New York City landmark, the Jacob Javits Center.\n\nAs for Clarity, he is now dead, and HIS New York Times obit called him \"rumpled and irascible\".\n\nThat'll teach him a lesson!\n\nOh, wait.",
