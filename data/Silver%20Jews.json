  "description": "Picking a band name is hard. Heck, U2 might be one of the most famous bands ever, but Bono himself hates the name. And if we're talking famous bands, The Beatles? It might be blasphemous, but: not a very good name.\n\nWhich brings us to indie rockers Silver Jews, a much less glamorous band than the two mentioned above, but... a much better name. Silver Jews! Where does that come from?\n\nIt comes from front man David Berman, who formed the band in 1989. We'll let him explain his definition of \"Silver Jew\":\n\nA Jew that was Jewish down through patrilineal descent, which would be a Jew that's not a Jew, really. It's the outsiders to the outsiders.\n\nSo it looks like Berman's \"Silver Jew\" is very similiar to our \"Borderline Jew\" verdict, which we often use in patrilineal cases. And we'll use it for his band as well, especially because it seems that he might have been the only Jew on the band's long roster.\n\nBest band name ever? The Band!",
