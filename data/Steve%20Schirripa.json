  "description": "You gotta hand it to Bobby Baccala... err... Steve Schirripa. He had one minor role on \"The Sopranos\" that expanded during the show's final seasons... and he took off and ran with it.\n\nSo, after Sopranos turned black, Baccala... err... Schirripa kept up with the image he cultivated as Tony's fat, dim-witted, deadly yet gentle brother-in-law. Perhaps you read a tome he penned, \"A Goomba's Guide to Life\"? Or it's follow-up, \"The Goomba's Book of Love\"? It's unlikely, we know. Still, a guy has to eat...\n\nSpeaking of eating, perhaps you tried his line of sauces, Uncle Steve's Italian Specialties? It's organic and vegan, and features a picture of Schirripa... err... Baccala on the label. OK, you probably never tried it...\n\nNevertheless, we gotta hand it to the guy for keeping at it. And, Bobby... err... Steve, we'll keep that fact that you're Halachically Jewish on the down low, capisce?",
