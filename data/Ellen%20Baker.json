  "description": "We've been greatly enjoying the excellent series \"For All Mankind\", which presents an alternate history of space exploration. (One might want to subtitle it, \"If the Soviets were a lot more competent...\") One path that fiction accelerates is NASA putting a woman in space. In real life, Sally Ride made the trip in 1983, twenty years after USSR's Valentina Tereshkova. (Yes, the real-life Soviets were the incompetent ones, but we leave it up to you to decide which side was more sexist.)\n\nRide was part of NASA Astronaut Group 8, which for the first time included women, Black, Jewish, and Asian Americans. (This was in 1978, 19 years after Group 1. Add racist to that checklist, please.) Ride was joined by Judith Resnick, who became America's first Jewish astronaut, going up in 1984 before perishing on Challenger two years later.\n\nThere were just two women in Group 9, and three in Group 10. Amazingly, two of those were Jewish: Ellen Baker, who became the second Jewish woman in space in 1989, and Marsha Ivins, who became #3 a year later. Together with Resnick and recent addition Jessica Meir, they make up the complete roster of Jewish female astronauts.\n\nGood luck with that first Jewish female cosmonaut, natch!",
