  "description": "In 1977, Milton Glaser, Jew, designed one of the most iconic logos ever. Full stop.\n\n\n\nI ❤\nNY\n\n\n\nSo simple. Three letters. One symbol. A city's message encapsulated. It's pretty perfect.\n\nOr so it seemed.\n\nApparently, the powers that be decided that there is need for a change. It has now become:\n\n\n\nWE❤\nNYC\n\n\n\nSimple perfection is gone. It's not even clear what it says: \"We love NYC\", or \"We NYC love\"? Glaser, who passed away in 2020, is probably spinning in his grave.\n\nOne small hope: the new logo seems to be universally hated, so maybe the powers that be will listen to the masses, and Milton's original will be restored to its rightful place.\n\nDon't mess with icons!",
