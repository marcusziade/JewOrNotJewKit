  "description": "Let's make this one short and sweet. \n\nAl Gore is not Jewish. He doesn't look Jewish, act Jewish, or have any Jewish blood anywhere in his family tree. Frankly, if not for a few ill-timed drunken anti-Semitic comments, Gore could have been the picture next to 0 instead of a certain fresh-faced Australian thespian.\n\nSo why even discuss it? Apparently, a rumor is floating around the European populace that former Vice President Gore is Jewish. We have no idea how this happened. Were they confused by his Jewish running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman? Perhaps they're thinking of John Kerry, whose grandparents were Jewish and who has a Jewish brother (he converted). Who knows?  \n\nSo, for the final time. Al Gore = not Jewish. Sheesh, you'd think Tipper would've been the first hint that maybe he wasn't?",
