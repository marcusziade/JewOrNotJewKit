  "description": "We've had some bizarre ancestries on our website. Ben Kingsley's Indian/British/Kenyan/Jewish/Mulsim combination is hard to top.\n\nBut Canadian pop/country singer/songwriter k.d. lang sure comes close.\n\nYes, she's part Jewish. But she's also... brace for this... part\n\nEnglish\nScottish\nIrish\nGerman\nRussian\nIcelandic (!)\nSioux (!!!)\n\nMan, that must be one family reunion. Move over, Sir Kingsley, we might just have a new winner.\n\nAnd now that that's settled... What's the deal with all the lower casing?",
