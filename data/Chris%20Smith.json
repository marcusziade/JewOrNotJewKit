  "description": "Is Chris Smith the worst Jewish NBA player ever?\n\n(Yes, Chris Smith, despite having one of the most goyishe names possible. Jewish. We'll get to that.)\n\nSmith played two games for the New York Knicks in 2013. Well, calling it \"games\" is charitable. He played a total of two minutes over two contests. The Knicks lost the first by 29, and the second by only 15.\n\nIn the course of those two minutes, Smith did not score a point, grab a rebound, record an assist, a steal, or a block. He didn't even attempt a shot. How bad was Smith? Apparently, Knicks coaches didn't even think he was good enough for their development league team.\n\nSo why did Smith earn a roster spot? It was done as a favor to his big brother, the much better J.R. Smith, who was on the Knicks at the time. And why was Chris Smith Jewish? Well, he converted to Judaism in 2017, as he took his meager talents to Israel.\n\nThat's right, Smith converted to Judaism AFTER his stint in the NBA. So he is not the worst Jewish NBA player ever. However, he is quite possibly the worst NBA player ever, period.",
