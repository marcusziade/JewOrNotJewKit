Well, that seems right up our alley!\n\nWe already dismissed recently retired Marty Turco, rumored to be Jewish. Cory Schneider of the Canucks, also rumored, is not Jewish either. Sergei Bobrovsky of the Blue Jackets? Who the hell are the Blue Jackets? Columbus? The NHL has a team in Columbus? Since when? Really? Well, not a Jew.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. Yes, there have been Jews who played goalie in the NHL, and no, none of them have been good. The last (somewhat) Jewish starter was Peter Ing, who, in his lone season as the Maple Leafs #1 in the early 90s, led the league in losses.\n\nOh, and dear reader from Washington, just to get it out of the way, Ing is not only ethnically Jewish, he is also ethnically Chinese. So in case you want to find out if there ever have been Chinese goalies in the NHL, no need to write to ChineseOrNotChinese.com...",
