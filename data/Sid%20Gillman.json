  "description": "Who is the most influential coach in the history of pro football? Many will say Bill Walsh, who in the 1980s revolutionized the passing game. Walsh's coaching tree is immense, with about 30 coaches he taught (or coaches who were taught by coaches he taught, or... you get the picture) becoming an NFL head man at some point.\n\nBut someone had to teach Bill Walsh, right? The famed 49ers coach first job in pro football was with the Raiders under Al Davis (back in the 1960s, he was not yet a walking corpse), from whom Walsh learned the vertical passing game (which, ironically, Walsh adapted to the horizontal game that won him all the accolades).\n\nBut someone had to teach Al Davis, right? And that someone was Sid Gillman. Gillman, who ran the Chargers during the 1960s, revolutionized football with that vertical passing game. (Yes, who would have thunk it. By throwing the ball deep, you can gain more yards faster. Stupid goyim, it's not that difficult to figure out. It took a Jew, of course.)\n\nAnd if we include Davis and Walsh in Gillman's coaching tree, together with such disciples as Chuck Noll and Dick Vermeil, we have over 40 NFL coaches, with 20 Super Bowl titles among them.\n\nSo there you go. Sid Gillman, Hall of Famer, Jew, the most influential coach in the history of pro football.\n\nExcept... well, somebody had to teach Gillman.\n\nRats.",
