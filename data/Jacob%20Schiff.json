  "description": "In 1904, Russia got into a war with Japan.\n\nThe two countries disputed over east Asian possessions; it escalated. The war was supposed to be a foregone conclusion. Russia, with all its imperial might, was facing off against a backwards island nation. Well, Japan won. And they won thanks to a Jew.\n\nNo, Jacob Schiff wasn't a Japanese Jew. He was a German-born American, one of the richest men in the US, a leading, influential force on Wall Street. He financed the Japanese army during the war to the tune of half their funds. One could only guess how it would have gone without him.\n\nSo why did Schiff help out the Japanese?
