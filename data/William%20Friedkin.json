Not so, says the Catholic church!\n\nAccording to the church, demonic possession is all too real. We're not making this up! There are guidelines issued by the Vatican, and a list of signs of possession that include \"supernatural strength\", \"levitation\", \"hatred of religious items\", and, obviously, \"loss of appetite\".\n\nYou can even buy a home exorcism kit on the Internet! (We're not sure if it comes with holy water, or you have to make your own.) Sigh. Silly, silly Catholics...\n\nLet us assure you, Catholics, you are NOT possessed. (Yes, even those who suffer from loss of appetite.) And if you're seeing demons?\n\nThose are NOT real, we promise!\n\n\ndemon = false;\nh = document.getElementById(\"holder\");\ninterval = 3000;\nk = 0;\nfunction swap() {\n demon = !demon;\n if (demon) k++;\n if (demon) h.style.backgroundImage = \"url('img/other/exorcist.jpg')\";\n else h.style.backgroundImage = \"none\";\n interval = demon ? k * 100 : 2000 + parseInt(Math.random() * 2000)\n setTimeout('swap()', interval);\n}\nsetTimeout('swap()', interval);",
