  "description": "Stupid Kabbalists. Stupid, stupid Kabbalists.\n\nNo, not because they attempt to turn Judaism into some sort of cryptic mumbo-jumbo. Well, that too. But also because no one can safely wear a red string around their wrist anymore.\n\nOh, you think no one will ever do it by choice? As a fashion statement? Why not? It's nowhere as stupid as a bow tie.\n\nAnd at least one person did wear it as a fashion statement: Usher. And when he did, people started wondering, if he was Kabbalist, or even — G-d forbid — Jewish.\n\nNo, he's not Kabbalist. He is not even remotely Jewish. He just likes wearing red string around his wrist. Is it that hard to comprehend?\n\nStupid, stupid Kabbalists.",
