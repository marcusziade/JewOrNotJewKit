  "description": "Dear Anti-Defamation League,\n\nWe have a little tip for you.\n\nMaybe you should give it a rest? We know your intentions are in a good place... but let us explain, if it's not clear.\n\nEvery time you see a supposed attack on the Jewish people, you raise a stink about it. Now, quite often your response is justified. But even if it is, it's just not worth it!\n\nTake Frank Zappa's song, \"Jewish Princess\". Sure, words like \"she can swallow my pride\", \"hairy little Jewish Princess\", \"a brand new nose\", \"who squeaks when she cums\", and \"who don't know shit about cooking\" might be tough to swallow. But you do realize that raising a stink  actually brought more attention to the song? The same goes every time you decide to cry foul. If you just let it be, it would go away much, much faster. See, we're still talking about it, more than three decades later!\n\nNow, as for our website?\n\nIt's all in good fun!",
