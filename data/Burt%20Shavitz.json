  "description": "Imagine: you go to the supermarket and see... yourself. Your face, selling lip balm, makeup, toothpaste. Only you don't get a cent from any of it. Such was the tale of Burt Shavitz.\n\nBurt was born to a Jewish family in Manhattan, but had an epiphany at an early age. The hustle and bustle was not right for him. By the 1980s, Burt was living in the Maine backwoods, raising bees and selling honey to locals. He met a younger woman, Roxanne Quimby. Together, they made his honey into a company. Burt became its face. Burt's Bees, they called it.\n\nIn the 1990s, the company grew by leaps and bounds. Burt's face was slapped on everything from furniture polish to, well, honey. Then, Burt and Roxanne had a fallout. She eventually bought him out for a house worth $130,000. Soon after, she sold 80% of the company for $173 million. In 2007, it was re-sold to Clorox for $925 million. None of that went to Burt.\n\nSo, while Roxanne was rolling in dough, Burt stayed in the backwoods of Maine, reverting to his old ways, living without electricity and running water. We doubt that he made it out to supermarkets to see his face adorning ointment.\n\nThat's probably for the best...",
