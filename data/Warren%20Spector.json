  "description": "Game Designer Warren Spector Announces His Next Game Will Continue to Fall Short of Lofty Expectations\n\nFamed video game designer and geek demagogue Warren Spector announced he was working on a new project today, promising it would continue his long and popular tradition of \"sounding like an amazing premise but providing little to no playability, coherent story, reasonable camera control, or minimally attractive graphics.\"\n\nSpector, born to two Jewish parents in Manhattan, is the famed creator of such promising disappointments as Deus Ex, Thief, and the Epic Mickey series. Fans of Spector's work enjoy his games for their intriguing and exciting concepts, horrible executions, and remarkable ability to be remembered fondly for their few redeeming qualities decades after anyone has actually played the things.\n\nUpon announcement of Spector's new project — despite not having played it nor viewed any of its assets — popular game review Web site IGN gave the game an 8.5 declaring it, \"a work of genius\" and a \"must play\" for \"fans of whatever genre this experience will eventually be in.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that gamers will hate [this game] when it comes out,\" Spector promised, \"but I have every confidence that in 10 years it will be remembered as a classic.\"",
