  "description": "More than a decade ago, Paul Feig created the then-ignored but now-so-beloved \"Freaks and Geeks\". Years in relative obscurity followed, before he hit it big on the big screen with \"Bridesmaids\". Feig is now considered one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He is specifically lauded for his work with women.\n\nBut what stopped him from being one of the most sought-after JEWISH directors?\n\nWell, it was a woman, alright. More specifically, Feig's grandmother.\n\nShe was born Jewish, but converted to Christianity. Her grandson was raised in Christian Science, and later became an atheist. So, in good heart, we can't straight out call him a Jew.\n\nWe do have one hope, however. Another woman in Feig's life, his wife, is actually Jewish. Perhaps it's not too late for him to return to his roots and become a JEWISH director? Can we get an assist with that, Mrs. Feig?",
