  "description": "You will be hard-pressed to find people who admit they like mimes. There is something creepy, if not sinister, about someone standing on a street corner, their face painted white (sans arched eyebrows and a harlequin smile), trying to pull an invisible rope or trying to get out of an invisible box. No, mimes are not exactly our cup of tea.\n\nSo why do we give Marcel Marceau such a high Kvell Score?\n\nIt turns out there is more to Marceau than just his character Bip. Forced to flee France during World War II, he joined the French Resistance and worked as a liaison with the American army. If we based our rating on that alone and ignored the creepy mime getup, we would be more than proud to have him.\n\nAnd you know what? Even with the whole mime thing, we're proud to have him anyway. If we're to have a mime in the tribe, why not the most famous mime in the world, the one who, if not invented, then redefined the genre?\n\nThat said, don't expect us to start a \"Mimes\" category.",
