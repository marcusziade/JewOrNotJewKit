  "description": "For those of you who are too lazy to click on the \"About the Jew Score\" link to the left, there are three components: I, O, and K. Of those, the I is usually the easiest to figure out. I stands for \"internal\", or, in most cases, how Jewish someone is by birth. So it's just a matter of doing a little research and then assigning the appropriate score. \n\nToday we're working on the I Score for Oscar-winning actress Rachel Weisz. She is not much help here; in some interviews, she identifies herself as Jewish. In another, she makes a point that only her father is.\n\nAnd yes, Rachel's father is definitely Jewish. So she's at least a 3, because that's, y'know, half (close enough anyway. Math was never our strong suit). But can she go higher? \n\nFor that, we need to figure out Rachel's mother. And she is half Jewish, half Austrian-Italian Catholic, making Rachel 3/4 Jewish by birth.\n\nSo if half Jews by birth get an I Score of 3, and full Jews get sometimes a 4, sometimes a 5, what do 3/4 Jews get?\n\nWhy, oh why, did we start to take this website seriously?",
