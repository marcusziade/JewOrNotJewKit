  "description": "Today, our never-ending tour to profile a Jew from every country takes us to Somalia. Since it would be incredibly hard to find a true Somalian Jew, we will once again turn to that category of Jewish colonial administrators that has already helped us fill a large portion of Africa.\n\nColonial Somalia was a rarity as far as Africa is concerned: it was actually ran by Italy, starting in 1889. From 1931 to 1935 the man in charge was Maurizio Rava, a Jew from Milan. (You might not be able to tell from the photo, but that's some fancy facial hair!) During his years in power, Rava did much to modernize the country, including furthering the education system, and, quite importantly, abolishing slavery. So why such a low K Score?\n\nAlas, Rava might have been the highest-ranking Jew in the Fascist party... Mussolini had to grant him an exemption to avoid the fate of Italy's other Jews.\n\nSo, not exactly someone to be proud about. Still, Rava gives us Somalia, and even Libya, for he was also vice governor of the Italian colony there. This tour is going to end sometime, right?",
