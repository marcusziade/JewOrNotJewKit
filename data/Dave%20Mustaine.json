  "description": "In 1983, extra super rock guitarist Dave Mustaine was on his way to New York City to record his first real album along with his band: a little group you may have heard of called Metallica. It was going to be his defining moment.\n\nBut then as soon as he arrived in New York, the band kicked him out and sent him on a bus back to LA. Apparently, when you drink too much for a band nicknamed Alcoholica, you really do drink too much.\n\nSo Mustaine went home and formed his own band called Megadeth. And in  1992 they released their most successful album: Countdown to Extinction. It was a hit. It was going to be Mustaine's defining moment.\n\nOnly it was swallowed up by the heavy metal tsunami known as Metallica's Black Album. So so much for that.\n\nMustaine has had his share of successes and failures since then. But always in the shadow of his former bandmates. Until today. \n\nFor you see, no matter how hard he has tried to shake it (despite his Jewish mother, he was raised a Jehovah's Witness, he since has become a full-on Christian refusing to perform with satanic/black metal bands), Mustaine has a higher Jew Score than any of his former Metallica members (any of whom, at best, would score a 5).\n\nSo enjoy your moment in the sun, Dave. While you can...",
