  "description": "Russia's science fiction legacy is massive. Built during the days of the Soviet Union with the belief that the future will be glorious — momentous — communist... Well, let's just say that it had its ups and downs through the years.\n\nPerhaps the most revered of Soviet science fiction authors were the Strugatsky brothers, Arkady and Boris. The writing team penned close to thirty acclaimed novels... those that were published, that is.\n\nIf one follows closely their work, one would see the embracing of Soviet ideals in their early novels. Then, as the duo became established, their work became darker and darker, leading to — what else in the Soviet Union — being censored.\n\nAs perestroika came, censorship eased up, allowing for publication of what many consider their greatest novels. Sadly, Arkady passed away in 1991, just as the Soviet Union was disintegrating.\n\nBoris is still writing, be it by himself. And not just books; he penned a thoughtful essay on antisemitism, looking in depth at Russia's antisemitic history and talking about his own experiences as a son of a Jewish father and a goyishe mother.\n\nWith a past like that, is there any doubt that Russia's future will be glorious and momentous?",
