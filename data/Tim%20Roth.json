  "description": "Englishman Ernie Smith didn't like his last name. Not only was it too pedestrian, but he also wanted to cut ties with his family. So Ernie Smith became Ernie Roth.\n\nHow did he come up with that name? Well, Ernie was a gunner during World War II, and wanted his name to be a tribute to the Jews that died during the war. A commendable selection indeed.\n\nAlthough... Roth? Talk about taking an easy way out with a Jewish name. One syllable? Couldn't Ernie at least make it Rothstein? Rothberg? Rothenheimer?\n\nSo no, Ernie's son, actor Tim Roth, is not Jewish, although he does get invited to many Jewish functions.\n\nThat's not the worst side effect of having a Jewish last name, we can tell you that.",
