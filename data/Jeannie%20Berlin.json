  "description": "There's a huge problem with Amazon's \"Hunters\", and we don't mean the unnecessary twist at the end. The numbers just don't add up.\n\nRuth is shown as a very old woman in 1977 (Jeannie Berlin, who plays her, is 70), but as a very young one when she went through Auschwitz (it is not clear how old actress Annie Hagg is, but she can't be more than 30). One might say that the Holocaust ages people prematurely, so let's take it a step further.\n\nRuth's grandson, Jonah, is 19 (played by previously profiled Logan Lerman, who is 28, but whatever). If he is 19 in 1977, that means he was born in 1958, give or take. But Ruth is shown exiting Auschwitz in 1945, clearly without child. That means that Jonah's unseen mother was born in 1945 (at the earliest) and was 12 or 13 (at most) when she gave birth herself. Witness the rigors of simple arithmetic!\n\nAs for the show itself? So much potential, but ultimately unsatisfying. And don't get us started on Al Pacino's accent, numerous plot holes, and especially that twist...",
