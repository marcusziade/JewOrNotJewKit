  "description": "Hey you, Manny Pacquiao, boxing's newest golden boy!\n\nYes, you, with your tiny head!\n\nBe afraid. Be VERY AFRAID.\n\nSo you think you're up to the challenge? Really? Are you ready for a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn who studies the Torah in his spare time?\n\nOh, you wait... Just you wait.\n\nWait for Yuri Foreman — that's WBA Super Welterweight CHAMPION Yuri Foreman — to unleash his rabbinical fury on your puny little head... You wont know what hit you... POW! SMACK! And POW again!\n\nHere's a tip for you, Manny. Give up NOW. Why suffer through the humiliation of getting pummeled to pieces? Just retire to wherever you come from and cry into your tiny pillow about your lost boxing glory.\n\nYou can't win, Manny. YOU. CAN'T. WIN.",
