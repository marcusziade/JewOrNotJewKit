  "description": "About halthway through \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (don't worry, there are no real spoilers here), we meet a pilot who is a little... out of place. He's somewhat... heftier than other pilots. He is Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, he is not exactly a major character, but he does have a couple of lines...\n\nSnap is played by Greg Grunberg. How did he get the role? Well, he is J.J. Abrams' childhood friend! In fact, Abrams gives him roles, some large (no pun intended), some small, in pretty much of all his creations. Grunberg is in \"Felicity\", \"Alias\", \"Lost\", \"Mission Impossible III\", \"Star Trek\"...\n\nSo, good for Greg, good for J.J. for throwing a bone to a childhood friend, and good for us, as we have another Jewish face in the Star Wars saga. As for Greg's heftiness...\n\nDoes anyone remember Porkins from the original \"Star Wars\"?",
