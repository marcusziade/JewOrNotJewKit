  "description": "It's hard to surprise us here at JONJ. In fact, after a year and a half of running this website, we're supposed to surprise others. \"So, Mr. Spartypants, tell us who is Jewish,\" people ask. And we try to come up with someone interesting. Gwyneth Paltrow! John Kerry! Sean Penn! And people gasp, surprised. Perhaps \"gasped\" is too strong of a word.\n\nYou see, for after a year and a half of running website, we've scoured the internet far and wide to see every possible published list of Jews, fake Jews, and rumored Jews. So even if we're asked about someone who we haven't profiled, we usually know the answer. (Infrequently, we make mistakes. Damn you, Rebecca Lobo!)\n\nSo imagine our surprise, when, after seeing Kevin Kline give a magnificent performance as Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway, we decided to look up if he was Jewish. We were so sure he was not; but it was worth a quick search. He was that good. We would have loved to claim him as one of our own.\n\nSo here we are, doing just that. It turns out that Kline's father was a Jew, be it agnostic, and although Kevin's mother raised him as a Catholic, we have more than enough to claim this thespian.\n\nSometimes it's good to be surprised.",
