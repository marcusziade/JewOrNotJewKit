  "description": "We visited California recently, and a friend suggested that we go surfing.\n\nSurfing? Jews don't surf!\n\nSeriously, what's the point of surfing? You try to stand on a board while waves are knocking you down... For all of what, five... ten seconds? For what? So you can \"ride the wave\"? \"Hang five\"?\n\nAnd the injuries? All the bruises and the broken bones! You better hope that insurance covers that!\n\nNo thanks, dude... We'll stick to safer beach sports: sunbathing and sandcastle building.\n\nPioneer surfer, Jewish South African Shaun Tomson? Exception that proves the rule.",
