  "description": "\"Me and my brother ruled London. We were fucking untouchable.\" â€” Ronnie Kray\n\nFor a good two decades, the Kray twins were the most notorious figures of the London underworld. In the 1950s and 60s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, heads of \"The Firm\", were involved in every type of crime imaginable. They also had the run of the town, hanging out with the British elite and celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. (Do you want to guess who played both twins in a recent movie? Tom Hardy, natch.)\n\nWere the Kray twins Jewish? Obviously, we would like to provide the definite answer, but... we can't. Here's the rub: they were often reported to have Jewish ancestry, but there is exactly zero proof that they did. The most likely scenario is that the Jewish rumors were simple xenophobia; the brothers were purported to be part Romany as well.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, the twins' many crimes caught up to them, as they were trialed and both sentenced to life for murder. Ronnie was certified insane and died in a hospital; Reggie succumbed to cancer after spending 30 years in jail.\n\nSo, no, not fucking untouchable.",
