  "description": "In Colorado, teenagers were disturbing their neighbors by blasting music too loud, so a judge did the unthinkable. He sentenced the teenagers to the worst punishment imaginable.\n\nAn hour listening to Barry Manilow.\n\nIn Australia, to stop nightly congregations of teenagers in residential areas, officials did the only thing they could think of to keep these hoodlums away.\n\nThey blasted Barry Manilow music for three days straight.\n\nSo yes, all-time best-selling soft rock legend Barry Manilow (born Barry Pincus) is Jewish.\n\nGreat?",
