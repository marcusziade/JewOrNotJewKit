  "description": "If you're from New Jersey, and, for the sake of discussion only, let's say that we are, then there are certain rules that you MUST adhere to, or they ship you off to Delaware.\n\nYou must go to the mall.\n\nYou must own/have owned/will own a Camaro.\n\nYou must own at least one shirt without sleeves (male only).\n\nYou must like Bruce Springsteen.\n\nWhich, for those of us who write for this website and live in New Jersey (just for the purposes of this profile, now) is a real problem. Because we hate Bruce Springsteen. Truly. With a passion we reserve only for Camaros and sleeveless shirts (we're either way about the mall).\n\nSadly, we can't deny his Jersey-sainthood, so we give him a nice K score. (But no 5. Take that!) What we can deny, however, is his Judaism, which is  wholly non-existent. If there were a second \"i\" in that last name, well, maybe. But as it stands, no such luck.\n\nSorry, Jersey Jews. We suppose it was a nice thought. Y'know, if you're into that sort of thing.",
