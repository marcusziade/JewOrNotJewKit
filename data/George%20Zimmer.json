  "description": "We noticed something very strange at the end Men's Warehouse commercials. You know, the discount clothing stores.\n\nThe ads used to end with a bearded man, who, in a soothing voice, told us, \"You're gonna like the way you look. I guarantee it.\" He guaranteed it! Well, that man was gone.\n\nMaybe the commercial was accidentally cropped, we thought. Nope! Later on, we saw another Men's Warehouse ad. The bearded man was gone again. What's going on? Are we no longer gonna like the way we look?\n\nApparently so. The man, George Zimmer (Jew, of course), founded Men's Warehouse back in 1973. Earlier this year, he was fired for his own company for unspecified reasons.\n\nImagine that. You build a company, and 40 years later, you get fired from it! We'd never let that happen to JewOrNotJew.com!\n\nWe guarantee it.",
