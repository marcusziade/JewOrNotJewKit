  "description": "Let's say you're very good at something... Oh, we don't know, baking bagels. Your bagels are great! The outside is crispy, the inside is doughy, and chewy, and a little sweet... They are so delicious! Everyone loves them. Everyone!\n\nSo you open a small store, and start selling your bagels. Everything is great at first. So great that you can't keep up with the demand. You build a bigger bakery, and open more stores, and... well, you got a success story on your hands. No one can get enough of your bagels!\n\nSo you think to yourself, what can I do to make this bigger? What about all the people who don't have direct access to your bagels? How do we reach them? What if we... FREEZE the bagels, put them in a bag, and deliver them to supermarkets... not just in your city, but across the state! Across the country! Now everyone in America... and maybe, soon, the world, can enjoy your crispy, doughy, chewy, a little sweet, DELICIOUS bagels!\n\nLender's Bagels suck.",
