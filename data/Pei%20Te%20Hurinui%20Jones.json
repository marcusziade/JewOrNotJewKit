  "description": "If you ever visit picturesque New Zealand (we highly recommend you visit New Zealand; in fact, this profile is being written on the road between the decisively-goyishe Christchurch and the almost-as-goyishe Queenstown), you will notice that many signs are written not just in English, but in Maori, which became an official language in 1987. \"Wharepoku\", for instance, means \"toilet\"; a very useful sign!\n\nSome Maori words you won't see on signs for obvious reasons, so here is one: \"Hurai\". We are Hurai. \"Hurai\" means \"Jew\".\n\nAttentive readers of this website must remember that Taika Waititi is that rare Maori Jew, but he is not alone. Pei Te Hurinui Jones might not have directed Thor, but he was an advisor to Maori royals. Jones, along with his brother, negotiated with the New Zealand government for compensation for land taken by the British from the tribes. The brothers, who had a Jewish father and a Maori mother, were called \"those bloody Hurai\"... by the side they were negotiating for.\n\nSadly, antisemitism has no bounds... even in picturesque New Zealand.",
