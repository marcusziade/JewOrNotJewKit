  "description": "Diane Warren lost at the Oscars. Again.\n\nFor the eighth straight year, the songwriter (Jewish; the original family name was Wolfberg) was nominated for Best Original Song and didn't win. It gets worse: in total, she's been nominated 16 times, the first one coming in 1987 for \"Mannequin\". (Remember \"Mannequin\"? It was a simpler time.) Other movies she's written for run the gamut from 1990s disaster classics(?) \"Armageddon\" and \"Con Air\" to the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic, \"RBG\".\n\nIt got so bad that the Academy had no choice but to give Warren an honorary Oscar in 2022, sort of a lifetime achievement award. That consolation prize didn't exactly thwart the streak, as she has lost three competitive races since.\n\nIt doesn't look that Warren will stop trying. It took Susan Lucci 19 tries to win her first Emmy, so there is still hope. Warren is only 68 and scores at least a movie per year, so there is still time.\n\nMaybe the Academy just didn't want to have \"Armageddon\" as an Oscar-winning movie...",
