  "description": "What's Japanese Breakfast? It's a Grammy-nominated indie rock band fronted by Michelle Zauner. The name can also refer to Zauner herself.\n\nZauner herself is not Japanese; she was born in Seoul to a Korean mother and an American father. The father has been reported as Jewish in numerous publications, but Zauner makes sure to point out that even though he does have Jewish heritage, he does not consider himself Jewish.\n\nWhat's a Japanese breakfast? We've been to Japanese restaurants countless times, but never for breakfast. What do Japanese eat early in the morning? It's not bacon and Cocoa Puffs, right?\n\nSteamed white rice. Miso soup, perhaps a pickled vegetable. Often, raw or fried eggs. Seaweed. Natto, made from fermented soybeans. Grilled fish. Tea, of course.\n\nWe'll let you decide which one is more Jewish.\n\nsetTitleOnly('Japanese Breakfast');\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('m/michelle_zauner', 'japanese_breakfast');\n}",
