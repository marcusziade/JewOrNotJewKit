  "description": "What do Jennifer Love Hewitt, Eddie Murphy, Nicole Kidman, and Steven Seagal have in common? Other than the fact that they've never been in our kitchen.\n\nThey've all released musical albums. Yes, right now, you can buy and listen to Steven Seagal play something called \"Songs from the Crystal Cave\". Please don't.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Scott Baio, Kevin Costner, Robert Downey Jr., Corey Feldman (oh, Corey Feldman...), Scarlett Johansson, Alyssa Milano, Brigitte Nielsen, Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris!), Keanu Reeves, Bruce Willis... There are more. Oh, there are many more.\n\nSo, when you get down to it, Emmy Rossum's decision to release an album wasn't exactly a shocker. The young actress was an up-and-comer, starring in \"Mystic River\" and \"The Day After Tomorrow\". And after appearing as the lead in the movie version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (yes, there was a movie version), a turn to music made some sense (at least more than it did for Steven Seagal).\n\nThe album didn't exactly fly off the shelves. So Emmy went back to acting, but has not yet reached leading lady status she seemed destined for.\n\nSo we'll just settle for another Jewish actress. Jewish musician? Well, to be honest, we'd much rather have Emmy than Steven Seagal...",
