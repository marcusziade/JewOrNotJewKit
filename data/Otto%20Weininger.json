  "description": "\"In the Jew and the woman, good and evil are not distinct from one another.\" â€” Otto Weininger\n\nWeininger was an Austrian philosopher who published just one book during his lifetime: \"Sex and Character\"... and what a doozy it was! Weininger argued for scientific definitions for men and women, and he wasn't exactly generous to the latter. The whole gender was divided into two roles: mothers and... prostitutes.\n\nIt doesn't get better from there. Weininger called Christianity \"the highest expression of the highest faith\". Judaism was \"the extreme of cowardliness\"... and was equated with femininity, which leads to the quote that we opened with.\n\nSo is it any wonder why the Nazis were fans of Weininger's work? Note that we didn't say of Weininger himself... for he was a Jew who converted to Christianity. Good riddance.\n\nSo why did Weininger only publish one book? He killed himself at the age of 23.\n\nGood riddance indeed.",
