Surely, if you don't want to go to a store (and G-d knows, we rarely do), isn't it easier to shop online?\n\n(For our foreign readers, and those under the age of 30, QVC is a television shopping channel. It was founded by Joseph Segel, Jew. There are others out there, but QVC is most prominent.)\n\nNow, granted, there is still a percentage of the population that is not Internet-savvy. But that is bound to die off (sorry), so what will happen to QVC and its ilk?\n\nMaybe it will be the end of television shopping. Or, maybe, TV and the Internet will merge into an uber-platform with incredible buying capabilities, with QVC at its forefront. Or, maybe, nothing will change. After all, what true American hasn't spent the late hours of the night thinking about spending $14.99 (plus shipping and handling) on a nose hair trimmer?\n\nWe'll find out soon enough...",
