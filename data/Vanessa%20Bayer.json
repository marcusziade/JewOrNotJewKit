  "description": "We haven't watched \"Saturday Night Live\" for a good decade, so we've never heard of Jacob the Bar Mitzah Boy.\n\nFor those like us those who haven't watched SNL recently, Jacob was a recurring character, played by Vanessa Bayer. He appeared every now and then on Weekend Update (usually around Jewish holidays), giving an awkward prepared speech, full of forced jokes. You know, like at a bar mitzvah.\n\nEver since we found out about Jacob (a tad too late, sure; Bayer has already been off the show for a year), we tried to watch some of those sketches online. Cringe-worthy, to say the least, especially those awful jokes. Cringe-worthy because it reminded us of our own bar mitzvah?\n\nAt least, we didn't look like THAT, right?\n\nRight?\n\nfunction flip() {\nswapPic('v/vanessa_bayer','jtbmb');\n}",
