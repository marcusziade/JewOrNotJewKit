  "description": "Over the years, our readers have counted on us to solve various mysteries. Answer strange questions. Discover hidden truths. And we obliged. \n\nWe will not try to figure out why Richard Salwitz, the harmonica player for The J. Geils Band, is known as \"Magic Dick\". Oh, the Dick part should be obvious; we assume it's short for Richard? That's the problem, we assume. You want to figure out if that's actually the case? Google it. We are going to pass.\n\nNo, we'll just mention that Magic Dick is Jewish... \"Magic Dick is Jewish.\" Four words rarely seen together.\n\nMaybe he was an amateur magician?\n\nWe don't know. We don't WANT to know.",
