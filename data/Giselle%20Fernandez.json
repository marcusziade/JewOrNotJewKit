  "description": "On her official website, former Access Hollywood host Giselle Fernandez proudly displays the cover of Latina magazine adorned with her photograph.\n\nOn that website, Giselle talks about Latina empowerment. She is on the Smithsonian National Board for Latino Initiatives. She is a regular presenter at the Latin Grammy awards. Yep, the woman does not take her heritage lightly.\n\nWell, half of her heritage that is. Giselle, born in Mexico, is only half Latino: the other half comes from her Jewish mother.\n\nSo, how does Giselle refer to her Jewish side on her website? Does she proudly display Yenta magazine? Does she mention Jewish empowerment or serve on some board for something Jewish or other? Does she even show up at the National Klezmer Festival?\n\nNo. But she does refer to herself as a \"Kosher Burrito\".\n\nHmmmm.\n\nWell, at least she has a sense of humor about it.",
