And then there is Pa Grape... who, you note, is different from the aforementioned list. No, not because he is a fruit. (We'll let the tomato debate slide here.) It's because he speaks with a Yiddish accent! Oh, goyim...\n\nApparently, Pa Grape was initially designed to be a hillbilly, but for some reason evolved into a pseudo-Jew. We really don't want to learn more about the development of VeggieTales characters, so we'll just let this one slide as well.\n\nStill, we're puzzled. How could a Yiddish-speaking Jew perform in a Christian acting troupe? Maybe he needs the money? Please don't tell us he is in it for the money, goyim!\n\nLet's just assume Pa Grape is a Jew for Jesus. And let's hope this is the last time we ever think about VeggieTales...",
