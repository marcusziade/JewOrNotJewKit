  "description": "It's funny to think about things that seem really obvious now, but at the time were heavily debated.\n\nFor instance, for the longest time, there was a huge debate in the astronomy field over the existence of other planets. No one had ever seen one outside of our solar system. Maybe there weren't any others. Of course, nowadays, it's not even worth discussing. Of course there are planets. Duh.\n\nSimilarly (well, not THAT similarly), when Simon and Garfunkel split in 1970, there must have been a whole contingent of people convinced that it was the beginning of Art Garfunkel's great solo career. Triple platinum Garfunkel albums. Garfunkel holiday TV specials. Millions of dedicated Garfunkel groupies wearing Garfunkel fros.\n\nThen reality set in. To be a Jewish rock star? Well, we've found plenty of those. To be a Jewish rock star who looks SO Jewish? OK, there are still a few. But to be a Jewish rock star who looks so Jewish AND is completely and unapologetically dorky? That's just impossible.\n\nSeriously, we know people took a lot of drugs in the 70s, but no amount of cocaine will make people overlook all that.",
