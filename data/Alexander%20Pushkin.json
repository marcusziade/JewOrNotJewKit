  "description": "One of the most frequent questions we get asked (besides \"how can someone so handsome write such witty profiles?\") is \"how come some non-Jews have higher Jew Scores than some Jews?\"\n\nA fair question. The answer lies within the K Score. As we say in the FAQ, it stands for Kvell (Pride) and is subject to the whims of the creators of this website.\n\nSo let's take a look at Russian author Alexander Pushkin. He was not Jewish, not even close (part black, actually), and his presence on our website is due to a recent Israeli(!) baseless rumor.\n\nSo an I Score of 0, a O Score of 1 (and even that's a stretch), and a K Score of...\n\n5. We can't go below 5. No, he is not Jewish, but damn it, we'd be so proud if he was. Pushkin is arguably (not even arguably. He is!) the greatest Russian author of all time (yes, that includes Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky â€” Not a Jew, Not a Jew), the father of modern Russian literature. Married the hottest woman in all of Russia and then killed in a duel over her... How can he be below a 5?\n\nAnd if that 5 gives him a Jew Score of 6 and puts him above such people with Jewish blood as say... Amy Fisher, then let it be so. It's our website, after all.",
