Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I just met this hot Jewish guy with a great sense of humor. If I marry him, do I have to convert? â€” Heather Rodgers, 18, Hoboken, New Jersey\n\nDear Heather,\n\nWow. Slow down for just a second. We're very happy for you, but you just met him? And you're thinking marriage?\n\nOn the other hand, if he is hot (wait, did we read this right? Jewish guy? Hot?) AND has a great sense of humor... Well...\n\nIt's up to you, really. Take a look at the Stiller family. Anne Meara married Jerry and converted. Christine Taylor married Ben and didn't. It's all about what you feel is right...\n\nOn the other hand, if you have to ask that question...\n\nThe answer is YES.\n\nYours in true romance,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
