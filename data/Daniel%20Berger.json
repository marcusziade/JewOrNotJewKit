  "description": "In a recent profile, we teased the desire to find the greatest ever Jewish golfer. Not because we enjoy golf; we find it incredibly boring and pointless. It's for completeness! We're completists here at JONJ.\n\nWe really have three options here. The obvious one is Corey Pavin, who won the US Open back in 1995. We profiled Corey all the way back in 2008... but there is one small problem. Pavin converted out and really wants nothing to do with Jewishness. So a hard pass on Pavin.\n\nThen we have Daniel Berger, who has never won a major, but is an up-and-coming star on the tour. He was PGA Rookie of the Year in 2015, and has won three recent tournaments. Whenever he appears on the leader board, our inbox gets flooded with his name. So he is a good choice, and potentially has the chance to take the top spot from...\n\nSomeone we profiled back in 2018, someone who has won five(!) majors, someone who is in the sport's Hall of Fame. The greatest Jewish golfer ever:\n\nAmy Alcott.",
