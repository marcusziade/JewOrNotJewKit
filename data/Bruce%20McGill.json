Duct tape, rope, moth balls, candlesticks, vodka, rocks, rubber bands, hockey tickets... Yes, we distinctly remember one episode where MacGuyver stopped an explosion using hockey tickets. (This is part of a little-known corollary that every mulleted Canadian actor starring in an American TV show must proclaim their love for hockey.

However, Bruce McGill, the man who played MacGuyver's sidekick, is (Halachically through his mother).\n\nSo mark another in our quest for Mc- and MacJews!\n\nO'Jews? That one is tougher...",
