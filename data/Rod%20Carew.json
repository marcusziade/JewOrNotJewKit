  "description": "Let's talk about responsibility.\n\nFor instance, if you're a well known, occasionally funny comedian who happens to write a song about who is and isn't Jewish (a song that you intend to play over and over and OVER) then you might actually want to make sure the famous people you namedrop are actually, y'know, Jewish.\n\nBecause, contrary to said celebrity song, Hall of Famer Rod Carew? NOT Jewish.\n\nCarew's wife is Jewish. His children are Jewish. For all we know his fucking goldfish is Jewish. But no matter how much he talks about how he likes the faith (thanks, by the way. We like it, too), Carew never converted.\n\nWhich wouldn't be a big deal if a certain tenuously talented individual would just take the five seconds to Google one of baseball's greatest hitters and all-around good guys before adding it as another insipid lyric.\n\nCarew was an Angel and a Twin, but he's not a member of the Tribe. No matter how many times you sing about it.",
