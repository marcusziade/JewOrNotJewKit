Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I just joined my high school team and I'm the only girl! The boys are all making snide remarks. They don't even want to play me! Should I quit the chess team? â€” Rachel Landsberg, 15, Pasadena, California\n\nDear Rachel,\n\nOh! Chess! You had us going for a second there. To quote Kurt Vonnegut, when in doubt, castle! But don't be in doubt here...\n\nJewish prowess in chess is legendary, be it men or women. Who can forget Judit Polgar, who was one of the strongest players on the planet, regardless of gender. And then there were women's world champions: Judit's sister Susan and Anna Ushenina of Ukraine, who won the title in 2012.\n\nAs for those boys, trust us, we know chess nerds:\n\nYou simply intimidate them.",
