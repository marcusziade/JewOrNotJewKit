  "description": "Every year, we make a point of watching the season opener of \"Saturday Night Live\", to see if any of the new cast members can salvage the now-horrible show. And to see if any of them are Jewish, of course.\n\nSo, when Andy Samberg first appeared as a featured player back in 2005, it was obvious he was Jewish (that nose, Jewfro, and name are a dead giveaway), but little did we know that he will not only become SNL's only consistently funny performer, but change all of television and the Internet to go with it.\n\nHow, you ask?\n\nWell, \"Lazy Sunday\", the digital short written by and starring Samberg that premiered later in that 2005 season. Soon after, it was uploaded to a new video sharing site called YouTube.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\n\"Lazy Sunday\" went viral, collecting millions of hits in days. YouTube became Internet's video-sharing destination, and was sold to Google for billions. NBC, seeing that there is something to be gained from allowing video content to be streamed online, launched Hulu, allowing us to see shows like SNL online soon after they premiere on television.\n\nWell, maybe not SNL.\n\nBecause it's still horrible.",
