If you ever thought of Jenny Jones in the first place. We definitely didn't, yet here we are.\n\nOf course, Jenny Jones is most famous for a murder that happened as a result of her talk show. A man revealed his homosexuality to his crush; in return, he got killed. Somehow, the show kept going for a few more years. \n\nJenny Jones was born in Bethlehem. Not Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, but Bethlehem, Palestine. Yes, we said Palestine; in 1946, there was no Israel yet. Strangely, this probably makes her one of the most famous Palestinians in America, and we will leave it to you, the reader, to figure out if that makes her Israeli.\n\nNo, Jenny Jones is not Jewish. And now we will stop thinking about Jenny Jones for another two decades...",
