  "description": "George Orwell was wrong.\n\nNo, not about an ever-evolving language that is driven by contractions and abbreviations...\n\nNo, not about the cult of personality devoted to national leaders...\n\nNo, not about political ideologies being flipped on their head by those who are supposed to carry them forth...\n\nNo, not about a totalitarian regime where one's every move is watched...\n\nNo, not about a national creed ingrained in children from birth...\n\nNo, not about a world divided between dogmas where one side can't wait to wipe out the other...\n\nNo, not about a nationwide boogeyman whose crimes might or might not be real...\n\nWell, for one, Orwell made a point that his boogeyman, Emmanuel Goldstein, was Jewish.\n\nMost of the current boogeymen are, you know, Muslim.\n\nWe bet he didn't see that one coming.",
