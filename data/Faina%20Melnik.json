  "description": "The Track \u0026 Field Athlete of the Year is one of the most prestigious awards given, well, in track and field. It's been awarded annually since 1959. Some notable winners include Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis, and Usain Bolt.\n\nThat's on the men's side. For women, the award was first given in 1974, to Irena Szewinska of Poland. We already profiled Irena! One of the fastest women ever, seven-time Olympic medalist, Jew. A worthy recipient, obviously.\n\nA year later... the award went to another Jew, Faina Melnik of the Soviet Union. Faina was a discus thrower, who won gold at the 1972 Games and held the world record for most of the 70s. In case one wants to doubt her Jewish credentials, after retiring, she became a dentist. (You shouldn't doubt. She also competed in shot put. This was one tough Jew.)\n\nAfter that, the award has been given out every year...\n\nTwo Jewish women have been named Track \u0026 Field Athlete of the Year! Fantastic!",
