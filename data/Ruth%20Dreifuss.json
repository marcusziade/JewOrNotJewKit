  "description": "\"But women can't be president...\", said the seven-year-old.\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\", we screamed. \"Stop the horses! Whatever gave you that idea?\"\n\nWe know what gave him that idea. That poster of 44 presidents they have hanging on the wall in the school. They are all men, natch.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" we said. \"Many countries have or had female heads of state: Germany, Argentina, Ireland, Brazil, Lithuania, Croatia, Philippines, Costa Rica, India, Iceland, Australia, England, Poland, Thailand, Norway, Turkey, Guyana, Ukraine, Liberia, South Korea, Chile, Bangladesh, Latvia, New Zealand, Israel (of course), even the Central African Republic!\" (Alright, let's be honest, some of those we had to look up for the purpose of this profile, but most were off the top of our head.) \"In fact, the United States is one of few countries that never had a female president.\"\n\n\"Even Jewish women can be president. Ruth Dreifuss of Switzerland, for one...\"\n\n\"OK, dad, I get it. Women can be president! Enough!\"\n\nSeven-year-olds, ya know?",
