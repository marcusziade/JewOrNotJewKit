  "description": "If you google \"Kristen Ritter Jewish\", right at the top you get hit with the following from New York Magazine:\n\n\n\n\n\nHuh, you might say. Jewish silent meditation retreat! That \"Krysten\" tried to throw you off the scent, but you knew all along... Ever since you saw her play Steve Guttenberg's daughter on \"Veronica Mars\"! They wouldn't cast a goy for that!\n\nAnd you might move on... but you should have clicked on the link! Herein lies the fallacy of modern internet searching, when we assume Google just summarizes everything correctly. The link reveals that the one who went to the Jewish retreat was not Krysten, but the interviewer.\n\nSo, no, Krysten Ritter is not Jewish, despite being in a long-term relationship with guitarist Adam Granduciel, who is. And, yes, despite being Steve Guttenberg's TV daughter.\n\nOur only hope is that this profile will get to the top of the \"Kristen Ritter Jewish\" search... With a proper summary, highlighting the verdict below:",
