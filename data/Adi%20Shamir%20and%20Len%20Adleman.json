  "description": "Do you know who Adi Shamir and Len Adleman are? Probably not. And yet, their names are hidden on many websites. Here, we'll show you where.\n\nYou need to go to a secured website (Google, Yahoo, what have you) and click through to get detailed security information. You'll get something like the dialog here.\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nYes, we've been to Google over 17,000 times. Thanks for counting, Firefox! Anyway, do you see the reference to Shamir and Adleman? Look harder! Alright, we'll help. You're not looking for names, you're looking for initials.\n\nSee where it says, \"Connection Encrypted\"? It's followed by a bunch of letters, including \"RSA\". Shamir is the S in RSA, Adleman is the A.\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nSo what the heck is RSA? It's an encryption algorithm developed by Shamir and Adleman. It's incredibly simple on the surface, but is very hard to break. You better hope that it is, since so much of the Internet uses it!\n\nAnd what does the R in RSA stand for? The third creator, Ron Rivest.\n\nThey can't all be Jews...\n\nr1 = document.getElementById(\"rsa1\");\nr2 = document.getElementById(\"rsa2\");\nfunction show(b, x) {\n r = (x == 1) ? r1 : r2;\n rr = (x == 1) ? r2 : r1;\n rr.style.display = 'none';\n r.style.display = b ? 'inline' : 'none';\n}",
