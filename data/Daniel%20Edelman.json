  "description": "There are not that many Jews in Major League Soccer... although, if you think about it, there are probably more Jews in Major League Soccer than in any other soccer league in the world (except for Israel, natch), and, if you think about it some more, there are probably more Jews in Major League Soccer than in any other American sports league, so... where were we?\n\nOf the scant number of Jews in Major League Soccer, many share an interesting trend. See if you can spot it!\n\nThere is (previously-profiled) Daniel Steres, a defender who plays for the Houston Dynamo.\n\nThere is (previously-profiled) Daniel Lovitz, a defender who plays for Nashville SC.\n\nThere is (currently-profiled) Daniel Edelman, a midfielder who plays for the New York Red Bulls. He captained the US youth national team to the quarterfinals at the Under-20 World Cup and is currently New York's starting defensive midfielder, helping lead one of the best defenses in the league. European clubs are scouting already.\n\nSo, did you spot the trend?\n\nSoccer parents! If you want your progeny to make it on the American soccer stage, there seems to be one clear way to do it!",
