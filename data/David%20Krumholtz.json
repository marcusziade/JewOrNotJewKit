  "description": "We started to watch \"The Deuce\", a new HBO show about the emergence of... ahem... the porn industry in New York City in the 1970s, a show featuring not one, but two James Francos. There are quite a few Jews involved!\n\nCan't profile Franco already, that was done a long time ago. Ditto with Maggie Gyllenhaal. Show co-creator David Simon, best known for \"The Wire\", has been done as well.\n\nThe lovely Margarita Levieva? You don't say, we already wasted a profile on her... a profile about a show she was on that barely lasted a week. Sorry, Margarita, you deserve better.\n\nAha! David Krumholtz! We haven't profiled him yet, right? He plays a scheevy porn director. Obviously Jewish, in real life and on the show as well.\n\nHoly crap! Krumholtz played Wednesday Adams' boyfriend in \"Addams Family Values\". Good thing we didn't know that previously, or he would have been profiled a long time ago, and we would have been left scratching our heads about whom to profile on \"The Deuce\"...",
