  "description": "Who doesn't love family get-togethers? We sure do! A chance to reconnect with long-lost relatives and discuss the current political climate!\n\nErr... Perhaps not. So when a family member mentions that \"Jew or Not a Jew\" website, you're more than happy to oblige.\n\nThis leads to you going through the whole cast of \"Girls\" (Hannah: Yes, Shoshanna: Duh, Jessa: Yes, Marnie: Hell no, Ray: Yes, Adam: No, to the surprise of the audience), which in turn leads to \"Gaby Hoffmann\"? (She played Adam's sister.) We haven't profiled her yet, we said. Why not, she is Jewish, isn't she?\n\nNope! Are you sure? She's Jewish in \"Transparent\", and such a New York icon! And, come on, look at her!\n\nYep, we're sure. So here is a profile, dear family. We love you all!\n\nWe also discussed the existence of G-d, the Holocaust, and Jewish identity! How is that for a family get-together!?",
