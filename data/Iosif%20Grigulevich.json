  "description": "Iosif Grigulevich was not Jewish. Even though his first language was Yiddish, he was a Crimean Karaite, a pseudo-Jewish group we recently wrote about. Feel free to head over to that profile if you need to clear up the confusion.\n\nHere is who Grigulevich was:\n\nAssassin. Acting during the Spanish Civil War, he organized the murder of Spanish politician Andres Nin. He also went to Mexico to try to assassinate Leon Trotsky, but failed.\n\nAgent. During World War II, Grigulevich organized anti-Nazi sabotage in Argentina.\n\nAmbassador. In the 1950s, Teodoro B. Castro served as Costa Rica's ambassador to Italy and Yugoslavia. You read that right, Teodoro B. Castro. Girgulevich assumed that name, as well as a Hispanic identity, and somehow was able to get an appointment to represent Costa Rica in Europe. One of his goals was to assassinate Yugoslav honcho Tito. He was only thwarted by Stalin's death.\n\nAcademic. After being recalled to the Soviet Union, Grigulevich spent three decades writing a multitude of books and academic papers. His expertise was Latin America and, strangely, Catholicism.\n\nSee, we told you he wasn't Jewish...",
