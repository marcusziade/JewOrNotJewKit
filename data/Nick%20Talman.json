  "description": "Sometimes things are made easy for us.\n\nWe love profiling fictional characters, especially when Jewishness is not clear. We hunt for clues, grasp at straws, invoke the eternal James Wilson Law... all to decide if someone not real is Jewish. It's not like we can ask the authors directly. (Hey, authors, if we got something wrong, feel free to contact us!)\n\nWe thought this was gonna be the case with Nick Talman, the lead character in \"StartUp\", a series that was supposed to be the flagship of Crackle streaming (it wasn't) and is now available on Netflix. It's a perfectly watchable show, full of gratuitous sex, violence, and even our favorite Dr. Watson, Martin Freeman. Nick is played by Adam Brody, Jew, and \"Talman\" seems ambiguous enough, and...\n\nAnd \"StartUp\" made it easy for us. First, Nick spoke at a Jewish funeral for a family member. Then, he was called \"The Jew\" by Russian gangsters. \n\nThat was easy.",
