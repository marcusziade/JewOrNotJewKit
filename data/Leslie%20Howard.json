  "description": "We've never seen \"Gone with the Wind\". Yeah, we know, such a monumental movie, and, nope, never seen it. We know it has a red-headed woman, some fancy dresses, and a staircase. Oh, and slavery.\n\nSo, as we kept getting countless requests to profile Leslie Howard, who played Ashley Wilkes, we had to pass. Who was this Leslie anyway? Our knowledge of 1930s actresses is not exactly omniscient.\n\nTurns out the joke is on us! Neither Ashley nor Leslie are women: Ashley is Scarlett O'Hara's beloved (we thought that was Brett Rhett Butler?), and Leslie is really Leslie Steiner, a British Jew (5/8th, for those who like keeping track).\n\nSteiner-cum-Howard's story is more fascinating than his acting career: he might have been a spy during World War II, and was shot down by the Nazis over the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThat will teach us to dismiss the greatest romantic movie of all time! Come to think of it, we've never seen \"Titanic\" either...",
