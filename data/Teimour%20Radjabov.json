  "description": "Have you heard? There is a Jewish World Cup champion.\n\nNo, this is not the soccer World Cup, or basketball, or any other sport (unless you're willing to stretch the definition of sport). And, unlike those other competitions, the World Cup champion is NOT the world champion. Confused yet?\n\nTeimour Radjabov was just crowned the winner of the Chess World Cup by surviving the field of 128. This does not make him world champion â€” that is still Magnus Carlsen, but by winning Radjabov did qualify to enter the eight-man candidates tournament. The winner of that one will have a chance to play Carlsen for the world title (NOT the World Cup title). Chess is confusing.\n\nIn any case, Radjabov, who was born in Azerbaijan, is in fact Jewish. He uses his mother's surname, as opposed to his father's, Sheynin. Radjabov is the second straight Jewish winner of the Chess World Cup, following previously-profiled Levon Aronian of Armenia.\n\nSo, we will have to settle for a Jewish World Cup champion. Strange statement, isn't it?",
