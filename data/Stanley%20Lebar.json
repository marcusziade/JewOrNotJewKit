  "description": "No Jew has ever walked on the Moon, that we're pretty sure. As we previously discussed, the original Apollo astronauts were pretty WASPy. (Although, if someone wants to discover a secret Jewish grandmother among those 12 WASPs, please let us know!) But a Jew did play a major factor in that that magical moment, the first steps of man on the Moon.\n\nObviously, Jews worked for NASA and had various roles. But we're talking about the exact moment when Neil Armstrong placed his foot where no man has gone before. It was all captured and sent back to Earth, enthralling millions.\n\nIt was captured by a camera designed by Stanley Lebar. NASA asked him to come up with a device that could withstand the Moon's astonishingly cold temperatures. Lebar did just that... he later even won an Emmy for the color camera used on Apollo transmissions!\n\nSo, no Jew on the Moon, but a Jew's camera is as close as we're gonna get. And that's not changing anytime soon....",
