  "description": "Some of the best movies and TV series are about criminal antiheroes, from \"The Godfather\" to \"Goodfellas\" to \"The Sopranos\" to \"Breaking Bad\". And then, there's \"Scarface\", highly regarded now, but despised when it originally came out.\n\nNo, not Al Pacino's \"Scarface\" (which the above line could also refer to), but rather then 1932 film that starred Paul Muni as a fictionalized version of Al Capone... the real Scarface.\n\nThat movie is often cited with two others (\"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\") as kicking off the gangster genre. However, reception back then wasn't exactly warm. Censors had a field day. The film was saddled with a secondary title, \"Scarface: The Shame of a Nation\", and was preceded with a prologue stating that criminals were, well, bad. The violent ending was changed, the movie was banned in multiple cities, and was soon pulled from circulation.\n\nYet today \"Scarface\" is considered a monument of the genre, and Muni as one of the most talented actors of his generation. And, unlike Pacino (the newer Scarface)... Jew.",
