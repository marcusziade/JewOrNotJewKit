  "description": "Pity Hollywood's recent trend of making werewolves young and sexy! Pity the young women who can't wait to be bitten by one of these supposed monsters! Pity!\n\nNo, werewolves should be hideous. Should be repulsive. Should be... Jewish?\n\nThe 1941 film \"The Wolf Man\" is a classic. It's pretty much the basis for all werewolf movies since. It's 71 minutes of Lon Chaney Jr. rampaging in rather terrible makeup.\n\nBut here is the strange thing: behind all that facial hair there just might be hiding a Jew. The movie was written by Curt Siodmak, Jew, who escaped from Germany in the 1930s. Siodmak not only invented a huge chunk of werewolf folklore, such as the monster's appearance during full moons, but also... based the character \"a bit\" on himself. \"Here is a man that hasn't sinned,\" Siodmak said, \"and is bitten by a wolf and has a horrible fate, and wants to escape that fate.\"\n\nSo let's take it from the creator himself, the Wolfman is somewhat of a Jew. And that's fine. Who would we rather have, a hideous horror legend or one of these hunky tweenyboppers?\n\nPity those who choose otherwise.",
