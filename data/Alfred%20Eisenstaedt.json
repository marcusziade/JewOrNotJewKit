  "description": "What's the most famous photograph of all time?\n\nThat's a loaded question, honestly. But after lengthy research (i.e., some googling), we came up with four possible answers.\n\n\"Migrant Mother\": Despair. Hunger. Hopelessness.\n\n\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\": Battle. Sacrifice. Triumph.\n\n\"V-J Day in Times Square\": Passion. Celebration. Love.\n\n\"General Nguyen Ngoc Loan Executing a Viet Cong Prisoner in Saigon\": War. Hatred. Death.\n\nThe four are so different, aren't they? So which one do you think was taken by a Jew?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorrect! Taken by Dorothea Lange, Not a Jew.\n\n\nClose... Taken by Joe Rosenthal, born Jewish, but converted.\n\n\nCorrect! It's the happy picture, photographed by Alfred Eisenstaedt. Wouldn't be our first guess, that's for sure.\n\n\nIncorrect! Taken by Eddie Adams, Not a Jew.\n\n\n\n [X]\n\n\n [X]\n\n\n [X]\n\n\n [X]\n\n\n\n\nt = document.getElementById(\"text\");\nfunction flip(x, b) {\nd = document.getElementById(\"pic\"+x);\nd.style.display = b ? 'inline' : 'none';\nt.style.display = !b ? 'inline' : 'none';\n}\nfunction answer(x) {\nfor (i=1;i\u003c=4;i++) {\n d = document.getElementById(\"ans\"+i);\n d.style.display = (x == i) ? 'inline' : 'none';\n}\n}",
