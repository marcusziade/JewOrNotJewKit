  "description": "We've spent two weeks writing profiles of Olympic athletes, which is all fun and good, but not as fun and good as Olympic mascots! Who doesn't love Olympic mascots? From Misha the Communist Bear to that French red hat thingie, they are pretty terrific.\n\nSo of all the mascots we could have profiled, why are we picking Wenlock? After all, the mascot of the 2012 Olympics in London is rather... divisive. We think he is awesome, actually. Just look it him!\n\nWe're profiling Wenlock because Wikipedia has him in the \"fictional golems\" category. Yeah, this requires a lot of dissecting, starting with the \"fictional\" part. If you know any REAL golems, please let us know, we'll profile them ASAP. Back to Wenlock!\n\nWenlock is... not, not an alien. He is an anthropomorphic steel beam. That's where the golem part comes from. We're not sure how he came alive; it's quite unlikely that a rabbi put a scroll in his mouth. (Now that we would like to see!)\n\nSo could a golem be made of steel? The usual material is clay, but we don't see why not. Make a golem out of steel, bricks, fusilli pasta, whatever. If it's made out of inanimate material and comes to life, it's a golem.\n\nBut does being a golem automatically make one Jewish? Well, this one's name is Wenlock.\n\nWe're gonna have to go with Anglican.",
