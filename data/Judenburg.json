  "description": "Austria is lovely, isn't it? Mountains, meadows, forests, castles... A nice place to visit, to be sure! Yes, they didn't exactly love Jews back in the day, but that's a thing of the past...\n\nAnd here's a lovely historic town, smack in central Austria, in the state of Styria. Population: 9,000. Home to a bunch of Winter Olympic medalists. Look at that comely tower! Such pretty greenery! Name: Judenburg.\n\nYou heard that right, Juden-burg. The name dates back to the 11th century; the town was first established in the 13th. And, yes, the name of it means EXACTLY what you think it means. Back then, it was a trading town, home to many, well... Juden.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Juden were all kicked out of Styria, but the name remained through the years. The Nazis weren't exactly fans, and proposed to change it to, among other options, Adolfsburg. The Austrians stayed firm, and the name remained.\n\nWell, the Nazis and medieval antisemites are now a thing of the past, and Judenburg is left to flourish. And even though there might be very few Jews currently living in it, at least the town's heritage is forever captured on its seal...\n\nOh boy. Lovely, isn't it?\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('j/judenburg','judenburg');\n}",
