  "description": "We watched some rugby on TV the other day. It seemed interesting, once you get past all the crotch-grabbing and the overall homo-eroticism (not that there's anything wrong with that). So we did some reading up on the sport.\n\nAnd then we got confused.\n\nFirst of all, there are two versions of rugby, league and union. Supposedly, these are two different sports (no clue which one we were watching).\n\nAnd then there is the terminology.\n\nFly-half. Hooker. Ruck. Maul. Tight head prop. Are these terms from rugby or from adult films (not that there's anything wrong with that)?\n\nBut we are not ones to get slowed down by lexicon, so to a rugby profile we go. And who better to profile than Joel Stransky, a central figure on South Africa's 1995 World Cup winning team (as depicted in the film \"Invictus\"). Not only was Stransky the team's leading scorer, he tallied all the points in the final, including the overtime game-winning drop kick.\n\nA Jewish rugby star? Talk about confusing.",
