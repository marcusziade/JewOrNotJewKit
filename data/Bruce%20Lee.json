  "description": "If this was GermanOrNotGerman.com, Bruce Lee would make a perfect profile. The ass-kicking, name-taking martial artist was part German. Go figure.\n\nBut this is JewOrNotJew.com, so we are not concerned about Bruce's German roots. He could have done kung fu in lederhosen, for all we care. But we are concerned about his family history, specifically on his mother's side.\n\nFor there is much debate about the ancestry of Bruce's mother, Grace Ho. There definitely are European roots there, but they might not be just German. Grace was supposedly the granddaughter of East India merchant Charles Bosman... born in the Netherlands, and of Jewish descent.\n\nYes! There we go! Bruce Lee, ass-kicking, name-taking JEW!\n\nExcept... well, there is no definite proof, but it looks like Grace might have been adopted. And any Jewish blood would have been wiped out by that.\n\nSo what are we going to do? Concede Lee to the Germans? Or send a search party to China to parse through birth records and family genealogies of Hong Kong merchants?\n\nSadly, we concede, but that's alright. Because there is no such thing as GermanOrNotGerman.com.\n\nSeriously, what kind of a silly idea is that?",
