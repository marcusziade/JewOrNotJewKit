  "description": "Scenario 1:\n\nYour company is making millions of dollars. You know this for a fact. They've shown you the profits. But every time it's time for a salary renegotiation or Chanukah bonuses or whatever, suddenly they cry (poor) wolf. In fact, at your review — despite acknowledging your superior performance — they ask you to take a salary cut. Yet you know, six months later, you'll be seeing those same numbers celebrating how profitable everyone is.\n\nThese people are assholes, right? \n\nScenario 2:\n\nThe National Hockey League (and Major League Baseball before it), despite repeated efforts to drive away its own fans, is once again profitable. And, once again, the NHL is now demanding that its players take a massive pay cut, locking out the league and alienating whatever fans it won back from the last debacle.\n\nBut somehow the players are the assholes here?\n\nIt's kind of amazing, isn't it? When it happens to us, it's those evil greedy corporations. But in sports, suddenly everyone is on ownership's side. It's one of those weird dichotomies we've never understood.\n\nSo go get those greedy athletes and their lead demagogue (and Jew) Donald Fehr you blue blooded, over-privileged, community-bilking do-nothings!\n\nSeriously?",
