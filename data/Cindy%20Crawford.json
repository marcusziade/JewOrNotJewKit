  "description": "Did you know that Cindy Crawford and Jon Stewart used to date? It's true! There is proof right here!\n\nTake a look at Jon's face. He is as shocked as we are. And yet, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. He wouldn't be the first smart short Jew to shtup a gorgeous shiksa. Smart short Jews are known for that!\n\nApparently, the two dated briefly in the early 90s, during the time that Cindy was married to Richard Gere. We always knew that marriage was a sham!\n\nIn any case, that didn't last, and Cindy moved to someone named Randy Gerber, to whom she's been married for close to two decades. We're not sure if Gerber is smart or short, but he's definitely Jewish.\n\nApparently, Cindy Crawford is into Jewish men. Now you know.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('c/cindy_crawford', 'cc_js');\n}",
