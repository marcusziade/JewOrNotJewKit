  "description": "This profile is about France. Pierre Mendes France, actually. Pierre Mendes-France, if the hyphen makes it a tad less confusing.\n\nMendes France, Jew, was the Prime Minister of, well, France, for just seven months in 1954 and 1955. A far leftist, his biggest priority was to end the war in Indochina. He did just that, with France (the country) withdrawing. The war-ending treaty partitioned the area and gave Ho Chi Minh the control of North Vietnam, which started the ball rolling towards the American intervention. At least his intentions were right.\n\nConsidering Mendes France spent such a short time in the office, ending a war seems like a pretty big accomplishment. Not everyone agreed, however, as his government was quickly toppled by, strangely, a leftist coalition. Antisemitism played a role as well.\n\nMendes France's other contribution was the suggestion that the French should drink more milk and less wine.\n\nDoesn't sound like France at all...",
