  "description": "Five black Caribbean guys, two Belgian twins and an Australian Jew walk into...\n\nSounds like a start of a terrible joke? Allow us to explain. This was the makeup of the 400 meter final at the London Olympics.\n\nThe Caribbean guys were all supposed to be there. So were the Belgians. The Australian Jew? Hardly.\n\nIn fact, Steven Solomon was not even supposed to be racing. Before the games, Australia was swept by a controversy where the 19-year-old, who only started running three years ago, was selected over a veteran.\n\nYet somehow Solomon made his nation proud, qualifying for a final no one expected him to make. He didn't medal, of course.\n\nSo where does this gifted athlete go from here? Well, he is enrolling in Stanford and planning to be a doctor. Now that doesn't need to be explained!",
