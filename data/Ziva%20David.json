She is the star of the most popular show on American television. She is Ziva David, Mossad agent.\n\nAlright, she is a fictional character. Alright, she is not played by an Israeli (and not even by a Jew!), Cote de Pablo. Alright, she's been killed off on her show. Alright, for all its popularity, we've never seen an episode of NCIS.\n\nHow could we forget? Natalie Portman was born in Israel!\n\nWho is the second most famous Israeli in America?",
