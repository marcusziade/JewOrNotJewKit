  "description": "The Arquettes sure are a weird family. And we're not talking about the lesser-known sister that used to be an even lesser-known brother. We're talking about their parents: a Jewish mother and a father who converted to Islam. Can't really imagine that holiday table.\n\nBut which Arquette do we profile?\n\nThe oldest sister, Rosanna? What has she been in? She had that pretty cool small role in \"Pulp Fiction\" in the Uma Thurman overdose scene. But since then? Ummmm...\n\nThe other sister, Patricia? She's on \"Medium\" now, which is a somewhat popular show. Wait... Are we sure that's not Daryl Hannah? Nope, definitely Patricia. Easy mistake to make.\n\nThe brother, David? He's starred in... ugh... what? He is married to Courteney Cox, so that's not too shabby. And he once was the world heavyweight wrestling champion... World? Heavyweight? Really?\n\nUmmmm....\n\nWhy don't we just jumble the three of them together and call it a day.\n\n(Editor's update, February 22, 2015: Whoa, Patricia won an Oscar? Well, this changes things...)\n\npatricia = false;\nfunction flip() {\npatricia = !patricia;\nif (patricia) {\n memorize();\n setImage('patricia_arquette');\n setRatings(3, 2, 4);\n setTitle('Patricia Arquette');\n setSubhead('\u003cbr\u003eApril 8, 1968 \u0026mdash;');\n} else {\n remember();\n}\n}",
