  "description": "Chairs. Odds are, you're sitting on one now. How is it? Comfortable? Good back support? Never gave it much thought, have you?\n\nSo what kind of a chair is it? Is it one of those dowdy monstrosities that could only be moved by a forklift? Or is it modern, slick and curvy, yet rigid and firm? Boy, that sure looked good in the catalog, didn't it? Those Scandinavians sure seem to know what they are doing... But what wouldn't we give for a cushion!\n\nSo who is behind that ultra-modern, ultra-slick, not always ultra-comfortable design? Would you believe a Danish Jew? Arne Jacobsen pioneered the Danish Modern style, in architecture as well as furniture. Including chairs; his most popular design is the Model 3107, with one piece of plywood curved to make the back and the seat. It's an international best-seller. It's not exactly snug.\n\nHmmmm. All this talk about chairs made us realize we're not exactly sitting pretty here. Maybe it's time to leaf through those catalogs...\n\nWe just have to remember to stay away from Danish Modern. Sorry, Arne.",
