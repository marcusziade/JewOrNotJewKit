  "description": "Who seems more Jewy, the man on the left or the man on the right? Fine, that's a loaded question, and we get quite a few emails berating us for relying on Jewish stereotypes. No matter! We know they are stereotypes! Just answer, which man looks more Jewy?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThat's producer Rick Rubin. The other person? That's also producer Rick Rubin. One is clearly the younger version of the other.\n\nRubin is one of the most prolific producers of the music business, working with everyone from Metallica to Rage Against the Machine to Aerosmith to Johnny Cash. He is most famous for his contribution to the Beastie Boys, and the younger picture dates back to that era.\n\nAnd, yeah, very Jewy, regardless of age.\n\n\n\nfunction flip() {\n  divHide('arrows');\n  divShow('blob');\n}",
