  "description": "What American cities have Jewish mayors?\n\nNew York, natch.\n\nChicago: Rahm Emanuel became its first in 2011.\n\nLos Angeles: Eric Garcetti is somewhat surprisingly Jewish; he took office in 2013.\n\n(This currently gives us three largest cities in the US... well, at least until Michael Bloomberg's term ends in November. We recently had another large one in San Diego, but let's just say that Bob Filner left prematurely, and leave it at that.)\n\nHistorically: San Francisco? Certainly. Miami? Of course. We got Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, even Anchorage and Boise!\n\nSo who are the holdovers?\n\nBoston, for one. Washington, DC. Houston and San Antonio... You'd expect Houston and San Antonio, except that Dallas has had three Jewish mayors! Dallas! Three!\n\nDetroit? No on Detroit. Our guess is the ship has sailed on that one...\n\n(Editor's update, 2017: Ron Nirenberg is now the mayor of San Antonio, so scratch that one off!)",
