  "description": "Pictured below is Colossus, the world's first \"all-electronic, digital, programmable computer\". Look at that thing!\n\n\n\nYou see that black item in the middle of the picture? That's a typewriter. Yep, Colossus had one hooked up for input. Anyway...\n\nHonestly, we shouldn't make light. The Colossus was enormous, and not just in its measurements. It had one purpose: to break the Nazi Enigma code. (That limited functionality is why it can't really be called the first computer... but boy, if you're gonna have one function, you can't go wrong with fighting Nazis!)\n\nWhile Alan Turing (Not a Jew) often gets the credit for breaking the Enigma code, he was not the one who created Colossus. That would be Tommy Flowers (also Not a Jew). Flowers built it as a response to a problem posed by Max Newman (here's the Jew), the mathematician in charge of the eponymous Newmanry, a section tasked with using machines to break the Nazi code. They were the ones who succeeded.\n\nNow reach in your pocket and pull out your phone. That little thing has about gagillion times more computing power than the Colossus. That being said, give us a ring next time it helps defeat Nazis!",
