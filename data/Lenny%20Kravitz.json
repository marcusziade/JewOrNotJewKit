  "description": "Leonard. Albert. Kravitz.\n\nOne of our favorite guilty obsessions is the phenomenon of black men with very Jewish names. Ian Gold, linebacker for the Denver Broncos, is a personal favorite. (When he was injured this year he was replaced by Louis Green. Also black. Also not Jewish. It's like the Broncos had a quota or something.) Of course, Leonard Albert Kravitz would make the Black Man, Jewish Name Hall of Fame.\n\nExcept that singer/songwriter/Lisa Bonet ex-husband Lenny Kravitz actually IS Jewish.\n\nWell, half anyway. Through his father. Which means that if you're of a certain mindset, he's actually not Jewish. But we digress.\n\nAnyway, whether you're pleased as punch about this revelation or pissed as pineapple juice depends on how you see ol' Leonard in the first place. Is he a hip, young, 70's rocker with grooving tunes or a pretty-boy hack with a borrowed, banal sound that caters to the lowest common denominator (and the highest common sales figures)? \n\nAs you can see by the three, we're rather split on the subject. As far as Jewish musicians go he's certainly not the coolest (Dylan) or the lamest (Streisand). We could go either way, really. We just really love the name.\n\nLeonard. Albert. Kravitz.",
