  "description": "On the Atlantic City Expressway, on the way in and out of the lesser city of sin, there is a large billboard advertising \"An Evening with Jerry Stiller\" featuring a photo of the man's face that's probably bigger than your car.\n\nNow, we like Jerry Stiller. Like him a lot actually. We're too young for his Stiller and Mears days, but we loved him on Seinfeld, heard he was good on King of Queens (we're dedicated to researching our subjects, but we're not suicidal), and we're always interested in what this talented, funny, oh-so-Jewish actor is up to.\n\nBut an evening? Really? With that ugly mug? Seriously, what does he do for three hours, yell at the crowd? \n\nMr. Stiller, you are welcome in our living rooms any time. But at $120 a pop for three hours of G-d knows what, we're gonna have to pass.\n\nThanks for the offer, though.",
