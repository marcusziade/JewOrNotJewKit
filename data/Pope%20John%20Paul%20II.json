  "description": "Has there ever been a Jewish pope? Trust us, the question is not as silly as it seems on the surface.\n\nThe first pope, Peter, was Jewish. Of course, after him, it was 2000 years of goiym. Nothing unexpected there. There was an antipope of Jewish descent, Anacletus II; frankly, we don't have the time nor the desire to research 12th century Italian politics to figure out the legitimacy of his claim to the throne. Plus, a photo for his profile would be pretty hard to find.\n\nSo what are we doing profiling John Paul II? Well, a researcher has delved into the Wojtyla family tree, and proclaims the pope's mother, Emilia Kaczorowska, was born Emilia Katz. We do know for a fact that young Karol spent a lot of time in the Jewish community in his birth town of Wadowice. And the researcher cites those supposed Jewish roots as the reason for Karol going into hiding during World War II, something that would have not been necessary if he was 100% Polish.\n\nAnd, unlike every other pope out there, starting with Peter and ending with former Nazi Youth Benedict XVI, we would welcome John Paul II with open arms. He did more than his fair share to improve relations between Catholics and Jews, and was praised by Jews throughout the world for doing so.\n\nBut, in all fairness, it's only one researcher's claim. So we're sticking with the verdict below, until someone makes a trip to Wadowice and confirms those findings. We're looking at you, JONJ readers.",
