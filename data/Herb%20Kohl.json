  "description": "We've discussed at length various stereotypical Jewish professions: doctors, lawyers, professors, Nobel laureates, comedians... But there is one we've only touched upon.\n\nDepartment store owners.\n\nSo why haven't we discussed it?\n\nWell, Jewish department stores are no more. There used to be dozens of them in every major city, from Abraham \u0026 Straus to Bamberger's to Stern's... But most have moved on to the great beyond.\n\nAnd those that have remained? Well, Kohl's is no longer Jewish. It was started by Jews in Wisconsin, but was sold in the 70s. Herb Kohl, who inherited the store from his parents, left his namesake to serve four terms in the US Senate. He also bought the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, leading them to mediocre obscurity.\n\nNBA owner? Now there's another stereotypical Jewish profession!",
