  "description": "If this was a profile of Tina Rutnik, lawyer, you might say: that could be Jewish. \"Rutnik\" has that Eastern European feeling that afflicts to many Jewish surnames!\n\nWell, this is a profile of Tina Rutnik, lawyer... but also a profile of Kirsten Gillibrand, US Senator, which sounds about as Jewish as a ham sandwich! Confused yet?\n\nThe surname is the obvious part: Gillibrand is the senator's married name, replacing, yes, Rutnik. (Which turned out to be not Jewish, but rather goyishe Austrian.) The first name is clear as well: Kirsten is her real name, but through her childhood and beyond, she was known as \"Tina\" because her brother couldn't pronounce \"Kirsten\".\n\nSo, now that it all adds up, we end by mentioning that Tina Rutnik/Kirsten Gillibrand is 1/8th Jewish, through her paternal grandmother.\n\nHopefully that wasn't confusing.\n\nsetTitleOnly('Tina Rutnik');",
