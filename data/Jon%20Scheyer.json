  "description": "Jon Scheyer might lead Duke to the NCAA basketball championship. And, even if he is not drafted in the NBA, he might tear it up in the Israeli league, which will embrace his Judaism the moment his plane touches down.\n\nBut Jon Scheyer will never top the Illinois state championship.\n\nAnd not just Scheyer â€” Jews. The entire starting lineup of the 2005 Glenbrook North High School was Jewish (and oh, for good measure, the sixth man as well). Somehow, Scheyer and his sidekicks defeated all comers, leading Glenbrook to the state title.  How exactly that was possible, we have no idea. This is basketball, not chess.\n\nCome to think of it, when Hollywood inevitable remakes \"Hoosiers\", as they do for all 80s classics (we cry for \"Karate Kid\". We plead for Hollywood to stay away from \"Back to the Future\"), why not base it on the story of Glenbrook North? They'll have to change the title, of course. \"Jews\" has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\n\n(Editor's update, 2021: Scheyer is taking over for Mike Krzyzewski as Duke's new head coach. Good luck!)",
