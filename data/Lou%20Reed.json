  "description": "We often joke about various spin-offs to this website. Such as CatholicOrNotCatholic.com. Or GayOrNotGay.com. The latter could apply to this profile as well.\n\nAnother spin-off that could apply here? DeadOrNotDead.com. For you would think that after decades of sex, drug, rock-n-roll, more drugs, more sex, and even more drugs, Reed would have kicked the bucket.\n\nA few years ago, he was even the subject of an internet hoax, when a fake wire story was passed around. No one batted an eyelash. Numerous radio stations broadcast the news of his passing. Lou Reed dying just made sense.\n\nBut he is not dead. Lou is still pretty much alive.\n\nBut we're not gonna create that spin-off. You see, \"Dead\" and \"Not Dead\" are such flexible states. We would just end up re-writing profile after profile. And honestly, we don't have that in us.\n\nSo no spin-offs here. We'll just stick with the original.\n\n(Editor's update, October 27, 2013: RIP, Lou.)",
