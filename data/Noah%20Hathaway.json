  "description": "How do you feel about \"The Neverending Story\"? You love it, don't you? Yes, a certain percentage of the population remembers it quite fondly. There are a few exceptions. \n\nOne is the movie's young star, Noah Hathaway. Not only did the director, Wolfgang Petersen, want to paint him green, but he made Noah go through quite an ordeal. Petrersen made him do his own stunts; Noah almost drowned, almost lost an eye, and was stepped on by a horse (note the missing \"almost\" there).\n\nAnother one is Michael Ende (err... was Michael Ende, he is dead now). Ende despised the movie so much that he tried to get its production shut down. When that didn't work, he tried to get the name changed. When that didn't work, he sued the producers. When that didn't work, he campaigned against it for the rest of his life. What was Ende's problem? Well, he did not like the \"revolting\" adaptation of HIS book.\n\nYes, there is a book. The book is absolutely fantastic.\n\nWe remember THAT quite fondly.",
