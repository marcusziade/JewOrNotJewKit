  "description": "Who invented television?\n\nThe answer is not that simple. There are many who can lay claim: Paul Nipkow, John Logie Baird, Charles Jenkins... But most agree that the laurels are to be shared by Philo Farnsworth and Vladimir Zworykin.\n\nWhat if we take it a step further? Zworykin did, in fact, participate in the first transmission of images over wires to the cathode ray tube, doing so in 1911. He did so under the tutelage of his professor, Boris Rosing.\n\nYes, Rosing's name should be added to the list. After all, it was his invention that enabled image transmission, leading to Zworkyn's eventual work to perfect it.\n\nSo — by now, you know where this is going — was Rosing Jewish?\n\nAlas, there is nothing clear. A number of sources lay claim, but there seems to be little evidence. Even if he did have Jewish roots, it's quite clear that Rosing's family practiced Christianity prior to his birth.\n\nSo, alas, we have to use the \"goy, until proven Jewish\" and let Rosing be.\n\nIf only the answer was that simple...",
