  "description": "There have been two well-known Jewish astronauts. One, Judith Resnik, is pictured on the left. The other was Ilan Ramon, not pictured. \n\nBoth are dead. \n\nResnik, still pictured on the left, was part of the Challenger tragedy. Ilan Ramon, was killed in the Columbia disaster.\n\nThere have been no other famous Jewish astronauts, nor space shuttle-involved deaths. \n\nWe'll leave it at that. \n\nBut to you goyim out there, if you're getting on the space shuttle and you see a Jewish person on board, you might want to rethink. \n\nY'know. \n\nJust in case.",
