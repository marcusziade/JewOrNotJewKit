  "description": "A short, curly haired European immigrant with overtly Semitic looks. An entertainer, performer and filmmaker of the highest quality. A virulent anti-Nazi who poked fun of Hitler and even played a Jew in one of his films. Charlie Chaplin certainly has all the credentials.\n\nThere's just one problem. He's not Jewish.\n\nGuess it's too much to ask that a Chaplin abandon the church.\n\nIt's too bad, because by all accounts he's someone we'd be proud to have. In fact, he may have the highest Jew Score for a non-Jew ever. An underappreciated category, granted, but still. He's out-Jewing some pretty serious Jews out there, and he's not even allowed on the bema.\n\nChaplin empathized with Jews, was quite the Semitophile (to coin a concept), and his half-brother might have been Jewish.\n\nBut in the end, he's just a glazed ham in brisket's clothing.",
