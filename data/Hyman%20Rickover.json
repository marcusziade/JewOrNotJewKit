  "description": "Names go in and out of style. For example, when we were children, every little girl was either Jennifer or Jessica. Today, the only Jennifers and Jessicas at playgrounds are mothers, watching little Emilies and Emmas play. And a generation from now, Emily and Emma will watch... these things tend to be circular. Linda? Barbara? Or perhaps Yo-Landa or Q'eira? Who knows.\n\nWell, we can guarantee that there are two names that will never go back in style. One is Adolf... The other is Hyman.\n\nHyman was actually a popular name early in the 20th century, but dropped off the map in the 1930s. Probably because \"Hymie\" became a derogatory term for a Jew, or possibly it being a homonym for \"hymen\"... Seriously, can you imagine a child yelling, \"Mom! Can I go outside to play with Hyman?\" Shrug.\n\nSo what is a parent to do if they want to name their child after four-star admiral Hyman G. Rickover, former Jew (converted out), \"Father of the Nuclear Navy\", recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal (twice), the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Enrico Fermi Award, etc, etc, etc?\n\nWell, one can take Hyman's last name and name the child Ricky, short for Richard. It's not like Richard will ever have negative connotations...\n\nOr, you know, not.",
