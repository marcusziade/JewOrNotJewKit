  "description": "Back in 2015, a shockwave rolled through the Middle East. Hamas claimed that they captured an Israeli spy... dolphin.\n\nThe alleged agent was supposedly wearing a camera, and \"equipped with killer arrows\". How exactly would a dolphin use such arrows (could it even operate a bow?) was not made clear. Perhaps, as some alleged, it was actually a ROBOT dolphin? There were conflicting reports.\n\nAs it turns out, this was not the first time Israel's neighbors captured animal operatives that belonged to the Hebrew state. The list includes birds (vultures, eagles, kestrels), beasts (hyenas, rats, pigs(?!?!?!)), and even reptiles (lizards, chameleons). How exactly Israel trains such an army was never made clear. (Seriously, pigs?!?!?!)\n\nOf course, this is not SpyOrNotSpy.com, so let's get to the burning question:\n\nYes. Spy dolphins would be Jewish (if they were real). We are really not sure about the pigs.",
