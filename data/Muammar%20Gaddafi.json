  "description": "Our 0 Club is even more exclusive than our 15 Club. While the latter numbers over a dozen, while the former only has three members.\n\nSo how does one get to be in the 0 Club? Well, one has to have no possibility of Jewish ancestry, appear and act anything but Jewish, and be so repulsive that we don't want anything to do with them. Mel Gibson, for example.\n\nOf course, by the nature of our website, we rarely profile such people. And even when we do, sometimes they get a point or two to escape the 0 Club. For example, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's original last name just might be Jewish. It's highly unlikely, but somewhat possible. (Oh face it, it's not Jewish. But go with us on this one.) So we begrudgingly give Mahmoud a 1. It has to be done.\n\nAnd here we thought that Muammar Gaddafi would join the 0 Club. But then an Israeli woman appeared from nowhere and claimed that she is Gaddafi's cousin, and that the Libyan dictator's grandmother converted from Judaism to Islam.\n\nNow, we can't verify her claims. Could Gaddafi really have some Jewish roots or is his supposed cousin just a attention-seeking nut? Who knows... but we can no longer give Gaddafi the 0.\n\nAt least we're keeping the O Club exclusive.",
