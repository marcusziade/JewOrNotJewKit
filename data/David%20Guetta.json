  "description": "We get our share of friendly criticism here at JONJ. For example:\n\n\"Your site is great, but all your 1980s references are a bit dated.\"\n\n\"Your site is great, but you need to profile more important historical Jews.\" \n\nAnd frankly we don't mind (especially if they start with \"your site is great\"). But here's one we get the most often:\n\n\"Your site is great, but it's just too American.\"\n\nOomph. Not much we can do about that one. After all, we, the creators of this website, are American, and so is a huge percentage of our readership. Never mind our multiple profiles of French actresses, Dutch soccer players, Russian authors, German philosophers, and Hungarian scientists; that somehow is not enough. Can't please everyone, after all.\n\nBut today, we will try to please that European audience, by profiling David Guetta. For those on this side of the Atlantic, Guetta is a French house DJ / music producer. His father is a Moroccan Jew, which makes David more than viable to be profiled on our site.\n\nNow, the only house we \"get\" is the one we live in, and you won't find us in a club unless we're dragged by our hair (and we're losing our hair), and we don't understand the obsession with celebrity DJs, but apparently Guetta is a huge deal in Europe. And a huge deal with our suggesters, who have flooded our inbox with pleas to get him on our website.\n\n\"You site is great, but I have no idea who some of the people profiled are.\"\n\nSigh. Can't win them all.",
