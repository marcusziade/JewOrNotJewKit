  "description": "The sequel to \"Casablanca\" is cinema's white whale; countless times it was close to being created, but for whatever reason, it keeps evading Hollywood's grasp. And that's good... that's good.\n\nWait, why is that good? Wouldn't we want to revisit one of the greatest movies of all time? Don't we want to find out what happened to its characters?\n\nNo. Trust us on this one.\n\nFirst, there supposed to be \"Brazzaville\", where Rick Blaine was to be revealed an American spy. Yeah, that kinda throws the original on its back. Humphrey Bogart actually signed off on it, but it didn't happen. Whew.\n\nOther failed attempts followed, until Warner Bros, which owned the rights, commissioned a book sequel. \"As Time Goes By\" it was called, and you can purchase it RIGHT NOW. (Don't.)\n\nWe'll skip to the big surprise. Rick Blaine is not really Rick Blaine. He is Yitzik Baline, a Jewish gangster from East Harlem... which supposedly explains his friendship with Sam. (Because why would anyone but a Jew from Harlem be best friends with a negro?... Ugh.)\n\nThere's more to it, but we'll spare you the needless details. Let's just make it clear:\n\nRick Blaine isn't a Jew. Yitzik Baline? Who cares!",
