  "description": "Dear readers of goyishe Czech, Slovak, Russian (and Polish) extraction,\n\nPlease let us know: do you question the ethnicity of every person of prominence with -sky (-ski) at the end of their last name? Because it looks like Jews sure do!\n\nWell, the -sky (-ski) ending is obviously not always Jewish! It can also be Czech, Slovak, Russian (and Polish). But we guess it's alright to question. After all, this is what our website is all about...\n\nSo, no, already-hated new Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is not Jewish. He is... goyishe Slovak, we think.",
