  "description": "We usually wouldn't profile a Jewish screenwriter. There are so many of them, penning everything imaginable, from a blockbuster seen by millions to a indie film seen by five people. But Charlie Kaufman... Charlie Kaufman deserves to be profiled. He is just that good.\n\nSo what can we say about Kaufman? For starters, there is the brilliant \"Being John Malkovich\", which put us in the head of the famous actor. Followed by the equally brilliant \"Adaptation.\", which put us in the head of Kaufman itself. Followed by the almost as brilliant \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", which put us in the head of a man with no memory. And we dig being inside those heads. Even if it is only for the duration of the movie.\n\nSo we dig Kaufman and his Jewfro-covered head. Rock on, Charlie. We can't wait for your next film.",
