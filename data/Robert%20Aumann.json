  "description": "Do Bible codes exist? Does the Torah contain secret messages that foretell the future? Are there hidden meanings shrouded between the lines?\n\nShort answer: No.\n\nBut what about all these prophecies that came true...\n\nNo.\n\nBut...\n\nNO!\n\nDon't trust us?\n\nThen maybe you should ask Robert Aumann, Nobel-winning economist, mathematician, wearer of fantastic beard, Orthodox Jew. Aumann spent a great deal of time researching Bible codes, analyzing the Torah from every way possible... His answer: No. Well, his short answer.\n\nHis long answer: It's possible, but very very very improbable...\n\nSo if you want to keep looking, you can. But you're not going to find anything. Too bad there's no Bible code to tell you THAT.",
