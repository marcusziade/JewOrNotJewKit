  "description": "Some Jews are easy to spot. Take Woody Allen, for instance. You don't need a Jewish radar (Jewdar?) or some clever website to tell you he is Jewish. One look at the former Mr. Konigsberg is all you need to permanently classify him as a member of the tribe.\n\nAnd then there's Harrison Ford.\n\nLet's face it; Ford doesn't look Jewish, Ford doesn't act Jewish, and \"Ford\" doesn't sound Jewish. In fact, if you poll a man on the street, they will gladly proclaim one of America's favorite action heroes to be an Irishman. And they would be half right.\n\nFor Ford's father is Irish â€” but his mother is Jewish. And as he says himself, he feels \"Irish as a person but Jewish as an actor\". Perfect. So you Irishmen can take his bulimic-dating real-life persona. We'll claim Han Solo and Indiana Jones.\n\nNot a fair trade-off? Sure, but what else do you expect from this website?",
