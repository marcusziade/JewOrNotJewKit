  "description": "Jerry Bruckheimer has had a long and storied (if not always illustrious) career producing movies. This can make his K score (the measure of how much we want a person to be Jewish) particularly complicated to quantify.\n\nSome of his movies are really good: \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Crimson Tide\", and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\". Some are pretty fun and exciting: \"Top Gun\", \"Bad Boys\", \"The Rock\", and \"Con Air\". Some are just utter trash: \"Armageddon\" and \"Pearl Harbor\".\n\nAnd then there is \"Kangaroo Jack\". How exactly does that fit in? Bruckheimer, known for big-time action movies, somehow made a movie about a rapping kangaroo. Huh?\n\nSo let's just give him a K Score of a 3 and call it a day.",
