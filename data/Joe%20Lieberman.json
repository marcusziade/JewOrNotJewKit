  "description": "Say it ain't so Joe!\n\nThe first prominent American Jewish politician since... well, ever and he's an unlikeable dope?\n\nWhy?!?!?!?!\n\nThis was it, y'know? He was on the ticket! I mean, come on, if someone told you there was a Jew on the ballot, you'd vote for him blindly right? Who cares about his platform, we're davening down Pennsylvania Ave! Except... ugh...\n\nJoe... you're killing us here!\n\nOK, so he didn't lie about his background, get a blowjob in the oval office or decide to make his own didactic personal beliefs into nation-wide policy like so many other ham-on-white politicians of late. \n\nBut, boy it's hard to like him. And we really feel we ought to make ourselves like him. \n\nBut we can't. \n\nHere's hoping he's just the harbinger of a new generation of first-line Jewish candidates and not our last, best hope. Because if this is all we've got, maybe we're better off letting the goyim stay in charge.",
