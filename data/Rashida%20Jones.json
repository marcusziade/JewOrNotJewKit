  "description": "Believe it or not, we, the creators of Jew or Not Jew, do not always harmoniously co-exist. Every day is filled with arguments, such as:\n\nDo we incorporate recent evidence of Bob Dylan's supposed return to Judaism into his profile? (no, for now)\n\nDo we keep up our frantic pace of a new profile every weekday? (yes, for now)\n\nChocolate, coconut, or plain macaroons? (still undecided)\n\nAnd... Pam or Karen from \"The Office\"?\n\nLet's just say that that last question has been discussed a bit more often than the macaroon conundrum. Hell, Karen hasn't been a regular for a year now, and we're still debating it.\n\nOn one hand, Pam has a great personality. On the other hand, Karen is super hot. But then, Pam is no slouch in the looks department either. Hmmmmm. Maybe we can use Jewishness as a tiebreaker?\n\nNeither character is Jewish. The actress who plays Pam, Jenna Fischer, is not either. But the actress who plays Karen, Rashida Jones, is. Yes, Rashida is half-black, the daughter of Quincy Jones, but she is also half-Jewish, by birth, and full-Jewish, by her beliefs.\n\nSo, does that settle the argument? No? Figures. Maybe we should just let it go and stick to debating macaroons...",
