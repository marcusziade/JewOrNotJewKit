  "description": "Could Chris Evans pass for a Jew? This is the question we wrestled with while watching \"The Red Sea Diving Resort\".\n\nThe new Netflix film tells a story of a group of Israelis who smuggle Ethiopian Jews out of Africa through, well, the Red Sea Diving Resort, a fake hotel in Sudan that gave the Jews access to, well, the Red Sea. It's based on a true events and is an important story to tell; as a movie, it's rather middling.\n\nEvans, who is best known to the world as the most goyishe superhero of them all, Captain America, continues the proud(?) tradition of goyim playing Mossad agents (see the Jessica Chastain profile for numerous examples). Here, he plays the lead role, \"Ari Levinson\" (perhaps \"David Cohen\" was deemed too obvious).\n\nDon't get us wrong; we have nothing against goyim playing Jews. And someone like Evans, who won't have another chance to appear in a Marvel movie, needs all the roles he can get.\n\nSo, could he pass? Not really... But that beard is a nice touch.",
