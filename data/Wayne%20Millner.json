  "description": "A couple of seasons ago, when Julian Edelman won the Super Bowl MVP, his Hall of Fame credentials began to be debated. (Despite the fact that his regular-season numbers were rather pedestrian.) But did you know that Edelman is not the first Jewish receiver to star in the NFL's title game?\n\nNote that we didn't say \"star in the Super Bowl\", because we have to go back all the way to 1937. The Washington (err...) Redskins were playing the Chicago Bears, and beat them 28-21. Starring for Washington was Wayne Millner, who caught nine passes for 160 yards, including two long touchdowns. Those numbers would be terrific even in today's pass-happy league, but especially so in the slow 1930s.\n\nBefore turning pro, Millner starred both ways at Notre Dame (a Jew at Notre Dame?!). He continued to play offense and defense in the NFL as well. Millner is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and a rare, rare Jewish player to make the Pro Hall of Fame.\n\nThat's one up on Edelman.",
