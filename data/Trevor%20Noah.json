  "description": "When Jon Stewart announced he was leaving The Daily Show, speculation ran rampant. Who will replace the beloved host?\n\nWhen the dust settled, an heir appeared: Trevor Noah. Who?\n\nNoah, a South African-born comic, is one of The Daily Show's newest correspondents. He is not exactly a household name, and his selection bypassed many thought more worthy.\n\nWhatever, fine. We're all for new voices. One small problem. Here are some of Noah's tweets (sic):\n\n\nAlmost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn't look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!\n\nBehind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man.\n\nMessi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks.\n\n\nThere are a bunch of others in a similar vein. And you know what, we're offended, and not because Noah is antisemitic (heck, according to him, his mother converted to Judaism and threw him an unexpected bar mitzvah). We're offended because Noah is supposed to be a comedian.\n\nThen why aren't his jokes funny?",
