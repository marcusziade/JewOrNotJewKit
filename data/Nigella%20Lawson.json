  "description": "Nigella Lawson is England's favourite television chef. For over a decade, she's hosted her own cooking show, has written numerous cookbooks, is known as the \"queen of food porn\", and has her own line of cookware.\n\nIn fact, Nigella is so popular that...\n\nOh, right. The food porn part. Fine, fine, you twisted our arm.\n\nNigella's presentation style is not exactly that of Julia Child. The well-endowed hostess practically climbs out of the television, flirting with the audience while preparing her latest dish. And somehow it resonates with both genders. To quote The Guardian, \"Men love her because they want to be with her. Women love her because they want to be her.\"\n\nAnd we? We love her because she is Jewish. Food porn doesn't even enter the equation.\n\nHonest!",
