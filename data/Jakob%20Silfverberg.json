  "description": "As we've explained multiple times, the -berg suffix is not necessarily Jewish. It can be German, Norwegian, Swedish...\n\nYet that hasn't stopped countless inquiries about various -bergs. We'll, with one exception.\n\nThere are numerous -bergs that play hockey. Most of them are Swedish: Peter Forsberg and Henrik Zetterberg, for instance. None of those -bergs have been queried on our website. It looks like the improbability of hockey Jews is overpowering. Well, with one exception.\n\nJakob Silfverberg, yes, Swedish, but with a name that seems to scream Jewish. Heck, anglicize it a bit, and it turns into Jacob Silverberg, who seems more likely to light Hanukkah candles than the light behind the hockey net. So Silfverberg inquiries are rather frequent.\n\nBut, no, not a Jew. Look at him! That's quite possibly the most goyishe-looking person ever.\n\nMark Wahlberg? We explained that one already!",
