  "description": "Don't get us wrong, we like Jason Bateman — honestly, who doesn't like Jason Bateman? — but don't you have the feeling that he stole took over Michael J. Fox's career? And no, we don't mean \"Teen Wolf Too\".\n\nIf you look at Bateman's career, there is a rather large gap through the entire 1990s. It's barely filled with forgettable TV movies and forgotten series, where Bateman could't even get close to top billing. Then, as we get into the 2000s, Bateman came out of nowhere to become a leading man, a handsome-but-not-striking-yet-so-relatable everyman avatar with excellent comedic timing. You know, like Michael J. Fox!\n\nFor what else happened as the 1990s turned into 2000s? Fox revealed his struggles with Parkinson's and had to retreat from the limelight... only for Bateman to take over his niche. Heck, as we watch \"Ozarc\", where Bateman's character is called \"Marty\", we can't help but think back to Fox's breakthrough role.\n\nAnd let's not forget \"Teen Wolf Too\"!",
