  "description": "Wait... Really?  Seriously?  Dwight David Eisenhower?  \n\nYou betcha!\n\nThis is what we live for. Finding that one, unbelievable, you'd never have thought it, Israelite. It really does come with a giddy little thrill.\n\nEisenhower? Are you sure? Really?\n\nAnd... No. Not sure. Not really. Not a Jew.\n\nWe fell for it ourselves for a while, but don't believe what you might read elsewhere; there is no evidence that Dwight's father was Jewish. (Yes, there is a note in Dwight's West Point yearbook calling him a \"Swedish Jew\", but there is no proof that it's anything but an inside joke; the yearbook also calls him \"se\ufffdor\", \"terrible\", and \"incompetent\".) If you look at the Eisenhower family tree, you will see not Jews, but Germans with some Swiss thrown in. Mennonites for generations. (We're not exactly sure who the Mennonites are, but they definitely don't go to a synagogue.)\n\nAnd here we thought we had one.\n\nOh well. For now, we'll have to get our giddy little thrills from elsewhere.",
