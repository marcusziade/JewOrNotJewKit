  "description": "Vitaly Ginzburg, Jew, Nobel laureate, father of the Russian hydrogen bomb, superconductor pioneer, found himself a new cause as he got older.\n\nReligion.\n\nDid he shed a lifetime of Soviet atheism to return to his ancestral roots?\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nGinzburg became an outspoken critic of organized religion. He even went was far as writing a letter to Vladimir Putin, expressing concerns about Russia's growing clericalization.\n\nIt wasn't just Russia. Ginzburg, who was rather proud of his Jewishness, criticized Israel as well. He found issue with over-dependence of Judaism in what is supposed to be a secular society.\n\nGinzburg passed away in 2009, and it's safe to say that his vitriol didn't exactly pay off. Russia, for instance, has made religion a mandatory subject in public schools.\n\nIsrael?\n\nDon't bet on it changing any time soon...",
