  "description": "So, whom do we have to thank for \"The Force Awakens\" not sucking being awesome?\n\nJ.J. Abrams, of course, for bringing back the spirit of original \"Star Wars\".\n\nThe entire cast, old timers and new.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Lawrence Kasdan.\n\nWho is Kasdan? He wrote \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". And, when Episode VII was having script problems, Abrams brought Kasdan on board to pen \"The Force Awakens\".\n\n(Another film Kasdan wrote? A little movie called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Yep, that's quite a resume.)\n\nWhom else do we have to thank?\n\nGeorge Lucas, for stepping away.",
