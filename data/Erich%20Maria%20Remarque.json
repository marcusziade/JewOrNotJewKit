  "description": "Erich Maria Remarque's masterful novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", ends with a fantastic plot twist. For those who haven't read the novel, to avoid the potential spoiler, we advise jumping three paragraphs below, where we discuss Remarque's potential Jewishness. (Spoiler alert: he is not.)\n\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\", the seminal novel about World War I, tells of the struggle of German soldiers. War is not glamorized; far from it. War, for the lack of better word, is... hell. Tedious, repetitive hell.\n\nThe twist? The novel is told from the first person perspective. On the last page, the narrator... dies. Truly a remarkable (see what we did there?) turn of events that shows that Remarque was ahead of his time.\n\nNow, for that potential Jewishness. The Nazis were not exactly fans of the author painting Germans as anything but ubermensches, so they started to spread rumors that he was Jewish. His real last name, Remark, was Kramer spelled backwards! (In reality, Remark was indeed his name, but he altered it to match its original, French, spelling.)\n\nRemarque's books were banned and he left Germany, probably for the best. His long life included relationships with famed actresses Hedy Lamarr, Dolores del R\ufffdo, and Marlene Dietrich, as well as marriage to Charlie Chaplin's ex-wife, Paulette Goddard.\n\nNo plot twists in this profile...",
