  "description": "\"I'm getting really sick of guys named Todd.\" â€” George Carlin\n\nThis will forever remain one of our favorite Carlin bits, so much so that whenever we meet someone named Todd, it echoes in our head. But why Todd? Other than, as George continues, \"it's a goofy fucking name, OK?\" (And so are Blake, Blair, Blaine, and Brent, Taylor, Tyler, Jordan and Flynn.) Yet Todd reigns supreme in its goofiness. Todd?\n\n\"Todd\" was virtually unheard of until the 1930s, when it began a steady climb to the top of the charts. It peaked in the mid-60s among the top 30 boys' names in America, before starting a steady decline. So it makes sense that Carlin decided to pick on it in 2001: by then, those Todds of the 60s started to grow up. (The Todd here, Golden, is a tad younger than that. Born in 1985, after a limited basketball playing career, he is now the head coach at the University of Florida.)\n\nRight now, \"Todd\" is back to to its original depths, barely cracking the top 1500 names in America.\n\nAt least no one can get sick of it anymore.",
