  "description": "In olden times, fat was beautiful. Extra pounds were a sign of loveliness. That second chin? Why not a third! It's Rubenesque!\n\nThen, something changed. Fat was out, thin was in. And \"thin\" became thinner and thinner.\n\nHow thin could it go? Well, how about the 1960s, when one of the world's most prominent sex symbols was someone named Twiggy? You know, as in \"thin like a twig\"? What was the second choice, Sticky? Probably not fancy enough...\n\nIt's all been downhill from there, thinner and thinner, to the point of absurdity. We're not saying we'd want to come back to the days of skin folds and layers of fat... But there's gotta be a happy medium somewhere, right?\n\n(If you're wondering what Twiggy is doing on our website, she proclaimed that one of her grandparents was Jewish. We are not sure why; research has shown her ancestry to be clearly goyishe. Besides, Jewish grandparents tend to OVERfeed their progeny...)",
