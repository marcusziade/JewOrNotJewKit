  "description": "The authors of this website were born in the late 1970s, but some of us have never felt as members of the so-called Generation X. Those were the older kids, wearing flannel and aimlessly wandering through life... That's not us, we thought! (We still think?)\n\nAnd yet, we definitely don't feel like Millennials either. Those were younger kids... the ones who grew up with the Internet. That's not us! We still remember combing through encyclopedias and newspapers. (Take comedian Iliza Shlesinger, for example. She calls herself an \"elder millennial\". She was born in 1983! What does that make us then? Geezer millennials?) \n\nSo, what are we? Apparently, we're not alone in this mid-generational angst. We're the so-called Xennials, a portmanteau micro-generation which spawns 1976 to 1983, give or take.\n\nSure, \"Xennials\" sounds silly, but we're gonna wear it with pride! (You're welcome to it as well, Iliza, as you just caught the tale end...)\n\nIt beats the alternatives?",
