  "description": "Sometimes, our wonderful readers criticize our beloved website. Take the Idina Menzel profile, for instance.\n\nYou see, Idina is quite a name on Broadway, with a star-making turn in \"Wicked\". But we reduced her profile to a measly mention, instead discussing a cartoon she was about to appear in. Some thing called \"Frozen\".\n\nSo the complaints came in. Well, at first. Not so much anymore.\n\nYeah, that little cartoon called \"Frozen\" turned out to be a record-breaking, award-winning, universaly-beloved juggernaut. Thanks to it, Idina's name recognition is much larger than it would be from a dozen Broadway musicals. Such is the world we're living in, theater lovers, for better or for worse.\n\nWhich brings us to Josh Gad. He was Olaf the Snowman in \"Frozen\"!\n\nWhat? He was on Broadway, too?",
