  "description": "\"As previously mentioned, we're not exactly big fans of most things on television nowadays.\" â€” Jew or Not Jew, 2008\n\nWow, has that changed over the past decade! TV has really gone through a renaissance, hasn't it? Of course, what we define as \"television\" has been modified as well...\n\nWe wrote the above before deriding \"Dancing with the Stars\". It's all there in the Brooke Burke profile. Look how clever we thought we were! A joke about taxidermy and a Steve Gutenberg reference. Strange that we didn't get that Pulitzer!\n\nAnyway, a decade has passed, TV has changed, but \"Dancing with the Stars\" is still somehow on, and we still have never watched a minute of it. But our readers have, and are wondering if NFL corner back Josh Norman, who was seen dancing while wearing a chai necklace, is Jewish.\n\nWell, he is not. He started wearing the necklace after visiting Israel. Maybe he likes the meaning behind it.\n\nWe wonder if we're gonna quote THIS profile a decade from now...",
