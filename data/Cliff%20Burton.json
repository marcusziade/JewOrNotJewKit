  "description": "Did you realize that for a brief period in 1982 and 1983, Metallica was actually... rather Jewish? 5/16 Jewish, for those who are counting (apparently, that's us...)\n\nCliff Burton, who is Halachically Jewish, joined the band in late 1982, replacing the goyishe Ron McGovney. At the time, the four members were Burton (1/2), Dave Mustaine (1/2), Lars Ulrich (1/4), and James Hetfield (goy), which does add up to 5/16, meaning if Jew or Not Jew existed back then (in newsletter form?), a profile of Metallica would have gotten at least a \"Barely a Jew\" verdict.\n\nA few months later, Mustaine was kicked out of the band, replaced with Kirk Hammett (goy). In 1986, Burton picked the wrong card (literally; he drew Hammett for first choice of bunk on a tour bus) and ended up being thrown through the window to his death. He was replaced with Jason Newsted (goy), but... you know what?\n\nThat's enough Metallica history for us. Still, sad how it ended for Burton...",
