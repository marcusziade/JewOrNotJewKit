  "description": "We weren't gonna watch \"The Righteous Gemstones\", because, obviously, evangelical Christianity is not our cup of tea. (Actually, any Christianity is not our cup of tea â€” duh.) But the reviews were good, and it was supposed to be a comedy, and it's on HBO, and it has John Goodman, so why not? We watched \"The Righteous Gemstones\". It was OK.\n\nWell, it started out OK, and pretty funny in many places, as a spoof of a Jim-and-Tammy-Faye-Bakker-like family. \"Succession, but Evangelical\", one might call it. Or \"Succession, but Idiots\". And it was fine. For a while.\n\nBut then, something changed. Oh, the characters are still evangelical idiots, but the show tried to make them LIKEABLE evangelical idiots. And that will just not fly. When the third season ended with shooting guns, racing monster trucks, and praising Jesus, that was the breaking point.\n\nWhich brings us to Skyler Gisondo, the young actor who was in a bunch of things, including \"Santa Clarita Diet\" and \"Licorice Pizza\", and has a prominent role here as the eldest Gemstone child. Despite that rather goyishe name (Skyler Augustus(!) Gisondo), he is Jewish. On the show, after denying his evangelical heritage for three seasons, he ends them by wanting to preach. We know it's acting, but still!\n\nSo that's it for us and \"The Righteous Gemstones\".",
