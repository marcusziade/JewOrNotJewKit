  "description": "There are a number of rumors about Richard Gere.\n\nThere's a rumor that he's very difficult to work with. We don't feel we're qualified to comment on that. We've never worked with Richard Gere.\n\nAnother rumor says that he is gay. Again, we'll have to abstain. Perhaps one of his wives or numerous girlfriends would be a better resource.\n\nThen there is a rumor that Gere was born Jewish. That we can help you with! He was not: his father was Methodist, mother Presbyterian. Gere is a now a Buddhist. We have no idea where the Jewish rumors came from.\n\nAnd there there is a rumor about... ahem... gerbils. Yeah, we don't feel we're qualified to comment on that one either.",
