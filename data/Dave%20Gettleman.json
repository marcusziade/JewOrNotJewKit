  "description": "\"Sports analytics\" might seem like an oxymoron, but they have revolutionized all professional leagues in the last decade plus. Most successful teams now look beyond old school statistics and eye tests. They try to come up with new ways to analyze data. Those who don't are left behind.\n\nWhich brings us to Dave Gettleman, the general manager of the storied New York Giants of the NFL. Gettleman famously mocked analytics when he was hired two years ago. He vowed to do his work in an old-fashioned way. That resulted in two of the worst years in Giants history and the firing of a head coach handpicked by him.\n\nGettleman barely survived a firing himself, and emerged a supposedly new man, even proclaiming his newfound respect for analytics. His team even hired \"computer folks\"! Welcome to the 21st century, David!\n\nWe're not buying it, however; it seems that Gettleman is sitting on the fence... very similar to his status as a Messianic Jew.\n\nTalk about an oxymoron.",
