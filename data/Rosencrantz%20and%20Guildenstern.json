You say Guilden, I say Golden...\n\nG: I should be the one asking you!\n\nR: Asking ME?\n\nG: Yeah, you, Rosen... krantz! \n\nR: That's a perfectly passable Danish name!\n\nG: Rosen? Yeah, lots of Rosens in Denmark! \n\nR: Lots of Rosencrantzes, sure. Dates back to the 1400s.\n\nG: Same for Guildensterns! Nothing Jewish here.\n\nR: You sure?\n\nG: Pretty damn sure!
