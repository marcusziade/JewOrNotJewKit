  "description": "When we first heard of Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, a movie about Nazi-killing(!) Jews(!), we thought... great! We can never have enough of those! But our second thought was, after looking through the cast... where are the Jews?\n\nThere's Brad Pitt leading the Basterds, but he's obviously not Jewish. There's B.J. Novak (Ryan from \"The Office\"), so that's good (although a tad weird), and... ummm... Eli Roth, sure, and... that's it?\n\nBut we don't need a super-Jewy-duper ensemble cast to see a Tarantino film, and see the film we did. Terrific. Exceeded all expectations. We were especially taken with Melanie Laurent, who plays Shosanna Dreyfus, a Jewish girl on the run from the Nazis. With all due respect to Christoph Waltz, who plays the Jew Hunter Hans Landa, Laurent steals the movie. Oh really, who do you expect us to pick? A Nazi played by an Austrian or a French Jew played by a French...\n\nJew! Indeed, Melanie is Jewish. We might have never heard of her before, but she was recently won the Cesar (France's Oscar) for Most Promising Actress. And now, with Tarantino helping hand, she will likely become better known on this side of the pond.\n\nAnd, although it might be hard to top Basterds, we'll be watching.",
