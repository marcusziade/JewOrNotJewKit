  "description": "We get it, goyim, it's Christmas. You don't want to hear about any Jews (except for THAT one). And yet, you made it all the way to our website. Indulge us!\n\nToday, our subject is... Christmas! Specifically, Christmas songs (which we have mentioned numerous times before, most thoroughly in the Mel Torme profile). But let's highlight one particular favorite, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". A lovely song, written for soldiers who want to return for the holidays... Heck, even astronauts have a soft spot for it!\n\nDid you know, goyim, that \"I'll Be Home\" was written by Buck Ram (somehow, not a porn name!) for his mother... his Jewish mother! There is a lot of controversy about its origins, as Ram was not originally credited. Apparently, he wrote the song, talked about it in a bar with Walter Kent (Jew) and Kim Gannon (goy). They stole it, gave it to Bing Crosby, and the rest is music history.\n\nOther than \"I'll Be Home\", Ram is best known for his work with The Platters. This included writing another classic song, \"Only You\".\n\nFine, goyim, we'll let you be. Go back to your eggnog and mistletoe. Not a combination we would consume, but, just like this whole holiday, there's no accounting for taste!",
