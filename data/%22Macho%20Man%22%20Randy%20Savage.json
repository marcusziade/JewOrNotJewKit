  "description": "Randy Poffo, the professional wrestler who became Randy Savage and eventually \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage (yes, he has a nickname for his nickname. Disturbing, we know), is Halachically Jewish.\n\nSavage?\n\nMacho Man?\n\nIf you were creating a Jewish wrestler, would these be the names you would choose? Yeah â€” us neither.\n\nWhat about, Randy \"The Litigator\" Poffo? Or Randy \"The Often Quite Humorous\" Poffo?\n\nDon't those sound more like Jewish wrestler names than Macho Man? Perhaps not as imposing, sure, but, really isn't accuracy more important than intimidation?\n\nWe're sure Randy \"The Especially Learned\" Poffo would have agreed.",
