  "description": "OK, so we have this guy. He used to be a high class chef and he wrote a book that was pretty successful. We're gonna ship him off to all these far out places and record him eating things.\n\nSo we're going to watch him cook a bunch of unique foreign foods?\n\nNo no â€” he doesn't cook any of them. We just watch him eat them.\n\nBut he explains how they're made. He teaches the audience how to make the meals, right?\n\nNot really. He just eats the food. Then he tells us it tastes good.\n\nOK... But I guess he makes the places seem fun and exciting? So it's kind of a travel show?\n\nEh. Most of the time we send him to places no one in their right mind would want to visit like Malaysia, Uzbekistan, or New Jersey. Also, even when we send him to nice places, he pretty much complains about it the whole time.\n\nWow, so I'm guessing this guy must be really charismatic, then. Really makes the viewer want to join him on his journeys.\n\nActually, he's a real curmudgeon who seems like the kind of person that would make you feel unwelcome in your own home.\n\nSo we're gonna take a ginormous douchebag, send him all over the world, and record him eating things and then complaining?\n\nThat's exactly it!\n\nAnd yet, here we are.",
