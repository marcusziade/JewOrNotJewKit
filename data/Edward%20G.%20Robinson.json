  "description": "To the left is gangster Rocky from Bugs Bunny cartoons (he usually appears with his partner, the dimwitted Mugsy). He is based on Edward G. Robinson.\n\nTo the right is Police Chief Wiggum from The Simpsons. He is also based on Edward G. Robinson.\n\nWho is this Robinson and how did he contribute to cartoon characters on such opposite sides of the law?\n\nThe Romanian-born Emanuel Goldenberg got his start in Yiddish theater. He then became one of Hollywood's most popular character actors of the 1930s. Robinson often played gangsters (Mugsy) and spoke with a distinctive brogue (Wiggum).\n\nThat's right, an iconic cartoon criminal and an iconic cartoon cop are based on a Jew.\n\nOf course, they are both iconic for their buffoonery...\n\nSuch legacy is better than none?",
