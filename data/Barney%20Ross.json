  "description": "Barney Ross' life seems straight out of an old comic book:\n\nPage 1: Young Dov-Ber Rasofsky is growing up in a tough Chicago neighborhood. Under the tutelage of his father, he is studying to be a rabbi.\n\nPage 2: Dov-Ber's father is gunned down at the grocery that he owns. Dov-Ber's mother goes mad.\n\nPage 3: Dov-Ber's siblings are placed in an orphanage. Dov-Ber is left to fend for himself. He joins a local gang.\n\nPage 4: Dov-Ber meets another young Jewish hooligan, Jack Ruby, as well as mob boss Al Capone.\n\nPage 5: In order to get some money to help his family, Dov-Ber begins to box. He is now named... BARNEY ROSS!\n\nPage 6: Ross progresses through the ranks, becomes a champion, winning titles in three weight classes.\n\nPage 7: But it's the 1930s. Hitler is rising to power. Ross makes a stand against Nazi Germany, becoming a symbol for American Jews. He then enlists in the Marines.\n\nPage 8: Stationed in the South Pacific, Ross and three other Marines are surrounded by the enemy. Two of his comrades are killed, but Ross single-handedly fights off a Japanese battalion, and carries the surviving American to safety.\n\nOn second thought... Comic book? Make that an epic novel.",
