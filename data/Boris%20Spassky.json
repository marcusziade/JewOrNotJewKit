  "description": "Previously, we lamented that only seven of world's fifteen all-time chess champions were Jewish. We expected more.\n\nSo when we found out that the mother of Boris Spassky was purported to be Jewish, we couldn't be happier. After all, Spassky was a brilliant player, a childhood prodigy who became world champion in 1969.\n\nSo another Jew to add to our list? Not so fast. For according to Spassky himself, the rumors that his mother was Jewish were not true. And what's even worse, Spassky recently signed an antisemitic petition that called Judaism \"inhumane\", said its followers \"committed ritual murders\", and asked for an expulsion of Jewish organizations from Russia. Proving that even geniuses can be idiots.\n\nSpassky tried to distance himself from the petition, but the damage was done. Damage to his reputation, and as far as this website is concerned, to his K Score. (Come to think of it, why does Spassky even care if there are Jews in Russia, if he himself is living in France?)\n\nSo we're stuck at seven world champions. Time to practice, young Jewish grandmasters!",
