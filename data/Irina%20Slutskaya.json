  "description": "There's a lot of confusion about Russian figure skater, two-time World Champion, two-time Olympic medalist Irina Slutskaya.\n\nNo, not whether she's Jewish. She is half; her grandmother lives in Israel and Irina was a recent inductee to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nThe confusion is about the pronunciation of her last name. An English speaker sees those first four letters and can't help but smirk.\n\nWell, that English speaker would be wrong to do so. Irina's last name is pronounced \"SLOOTS-kaya\". Stupid transliteration.\n\nIt's too bad that foreigners have to be such wet blankets. If they could pronounce their names like everyone else, things would be so much more humorous.",
