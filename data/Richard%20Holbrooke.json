  "description": "If this was QuakerOrNotQuaker.com...\n\nOK, there is no such thing as QuakerOrNotQuaker.com. Who would read that? Quakers? Are they even allowed to go on the Internet? They are? Anyway...\n\nIf this was QuakerOrNotQuaker.com, they would have some difficulty rating Richard Holbrooke. For those unaware, Holbrooke is one of the most influential politicians of the last quarter century. He served as Assistant Secretary of State under two presidents, was Ambassador to Germany and to the UN, and, most impressive of all, helped broker peace in the Balkans. So, clearly, the K Score (or whatever the equaivalent would be on QuakerOrNotQuaker.com) would be through the roof.\n\nThe difficulty would be with the other scores. (Who would Quakers pick as their score icons? Richard Nixon? William Penn? The Quaker Oats guy is a 5, right?) You see, Holbrooke's parents were atheist Jews, but, for whatever reason, decided to take him to Quaker meetings. Does that make him a Quaker? Borderline Quaker? Barely a Quaker?\n\nOf course, this is not QuakerOrNotQuaker.com. But come to think of it, we're having some difficulty rating Richard Holbrooke as well...",
