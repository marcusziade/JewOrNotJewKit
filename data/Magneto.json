  "description": "We try to stay away from politics here at JONJ. After all, our goal in this space is not to separate Democrat from Republican, pro-choice from pro-life, right from wrong, but rather merely Jew from Not Jew. Any other discussions of belief are ancillary to the main discussion.\n\nBut there is one issue that is simply too important for the future of our nation to ignore and we can no longer stay quiet about it.\n\nMutants. \n\nThe mutant problem is one we deal with every day. And while there's been a lot of bleeding heart liberal BS spouted off by Charles Xavier and his ragtag band of hippy-dippy X-Men, no one has provided us with a workable solution we can all live with.\n\nEnter Magneto. Our Jewish brother is not fooled by the promises of an oppressive government clearly bent on protecting the \"normal\" people from the superior mutant population.\n\nWhile we may disagree with some of his tactics, there's no avoiding the incontrovertible truth behind his intentions. The mutant populace with their indestructible claws, laser eye beams, and universal ability to look really good in skintight leather is clearly meant to inherit the Earth. Anyone who says otherwise is  delaying the inevitable. \n\nWe're proud to say that we stand by Magneto in his righteous cause. We hope that you have the self-honesty and foresight to do the same.\n\nThank you.",
