  "description": "Meet Mzbel (there's gotta be a vowel missing!), one of Ghana's most popular musicians. She is a singer in the style of hiplife, which mixes hip hop and Ghanaian rhythms.\n\nMzbel is famous for being religion-fluid.\n\nShe used to be a Christian, a Hare Kirshna, and an Israelite (but NOT Jewish). Then she actually became Jewish (we're not sure if she converted, but she claimed to practice Judaism), only to revert to African spirituality. Talk about flexibility.\n\nShe is also famous for saying that Jesus Christ was made up.\n\nCome back, Mzbel! You'll fit right in!",
