  "description": "Carlo Michelstaedter might have become one of the great modern philosophers. His writings were said to parallel Kierkegaard and precede Heidegger. Unfortunately, he committed suicide at the age of 23.\n\nAmong Michelstaedter's themes was the emptiness of life. Humankind, he said, foregoes happiness for potential reward that never comes. Morbid, indeed.\n\nThat philosophy matches up perfectly with the end of Michelstaedter's life. One evening, he returned home and got into an argument with his mother; she was upset that he forgot her birthday. Jewish mothers, right? Michelstaedter went upstairs and shot himself.\n\nForegoing happiness for potential reward that never comes? Sad, indeed.",
