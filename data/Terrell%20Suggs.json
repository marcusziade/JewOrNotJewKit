  "description": "When we found out that Baltimore linebacker Terrell Suggs has a Star of David tattoo, we had to investigate. Probably, just another case of an athlete borrowing foreign symbolism (random Chinese characters FTW!), but we had to know for sure. Thankfully, the Ravens website has a handy series of videos devoted to... player tattoos! Let's watch.\n\n\"It's a Jewish star,\" Suggs begins by saying. Glad that's confirmed. \"I got it after 2009, my worst season professionally.\" Oh-oh. \"I had to rededicate myself to the game.\" Oh? \"I got the tattoo to remind myself of who I am, the real me.\" Huh? What? How?\n\nWell, let's dig in further. \"I'm half Jewish, half Christian,\" Suggs said in an interview. Well, isn't that terrific! \"I'm a Jew for Jesus.\" Oh. Not as much...\n\nBack to the video. \"The tattoo is last bit of pain that I had to go through.\" You don't say, Terrell. \"I had to get approval from both mother and grandmother.\" Oh?\n\nWe guess not one told you (or your mother and grandmother) that tattoos are not exactly kosher, even if they are the Star of David?",
