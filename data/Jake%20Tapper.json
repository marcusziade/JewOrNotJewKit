  "description": "You, dear reader, have never watched CNN+.\n\nHow do we know that? Because no one on Earth had ever watched CNN+, and that includes all CNN employees.\n\nIn not watching CNN+, you missed such shows as \"Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?\", \"Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper\", \"Jake Tapper's Book Club\", and \"The Life and Times of Wolf Blitzer\". Only one of those is made up.\n\nWhy did CNN+ even exist in the first place? Why add more filler to a brand that is already mostly filler? Did the powers that be think that 24 hours is not enough time for the repeating news cycle? Did Jake Tapper (fully Jewish; his mother converted upon marriage) really need to muse about the subtleties of, we don't know, \"The Kite Runner\", with the world, with that world paying an extra $6 a month for it?\n\nWhat's next? MTV+? CourtTV+? CSPAN+? Fox News+? (Well, yeah, probably.) \n\nIt was nice (not) knowing you, CNN+.",
