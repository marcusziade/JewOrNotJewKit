  "description": "Let's say that you found out, just to throw it out there, that you were half, oh, we don't know, Belgian. Wouldn't you embrace your Belgian heritage? Read up on Belgian history? Drape your office cubicle in Belgian flags? We definitely would.\n\nAnd we definitely wouldn't deny it, which is what former Virginia governor George Allen did when he found out about that his mother was Jewish, but hid that fact from her family.\n\nWell, he tried to deny it at first. Then he tried it embrace it. It was all for naught. The once-rising star of the Republican Party was supposed to have been easily re-elected for his Senate seat, but instead was defeated by a huge underdog, Jim Webb.\n\nWas that because of Allen's denial and turnaround? We'd like to think so. Or maybe the voters were just tired of Republicans...\n\nEither answer is fine with us. Now excuse us, our lunch of Belgian waffles and Brussels sprouts has arrived.",
