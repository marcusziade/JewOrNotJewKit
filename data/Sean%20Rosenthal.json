  "description": "We are a desert people.\n\nWhether you follow the Bible stories, the historical record, the trail of the genetic code, you always end up at someplace very, very, very hot. But it's a drrrrryyyyyy heat, so, y'know...\n\nIn any case, though we may be thousands of years removed from our ancestral sands, that does not overcome the thousands upon thousands we originally spent there. And thus We the Hebrews tend to do pretty well when it comes to schlepping over the dunes.\n\nSo if Sean Rosenthal were, say, an Olympic hiker. Or an Olympic dune buggy driver. Or a camel. Then maybe?\n\nBut Sean Rosenthal is a beach volleyball player. And as your Uncle Mordechai who retired to Phoenix will tell you, it's a long way from the desert to the ocean â€” don't be fooled by the sandy similarities.\n\nSo, yeah, sadly. Not so much.",
