  "description": "True story: for the longest time, we thought that Helen Hunt and Holly Hunter were the same person.\n\nBoy, was our face red when we praised Hunt's performance in \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" Or when we commented how Hunter didn't deserve an Oscar for \"As Good as It Gets\".\n\nBut who can blame us? It's pretty hard to tell the two apart. Both are blond, both are about the same age, both won Oscars, and both have initials of HH with \"Hunt\" in the last name.\n\nAnd you would think that neither of the two are Jewish. Of course not Hunter, whose Southern charm comes through on the screen. Of course not Hunt, whose WASPy shrillness was the perfect counterpart to Paul Reiser's neuroses on \"Mad About You\".\n\nAnd we were wrong again. Not about Hunter; nothing Jewish there. But Hunt, WASPy or not, is a quarter Jewish.\n\nSo is that enough to tell the two apart?\n\nUnlikely.",
