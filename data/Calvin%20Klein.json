  "description": "Everyone knows that Jews don't have a lot of fashion sense. And that's fine. We'll admit to it. Our mothers dressed us well into our teens. Our wives dress us now. Our nurses will dress us when we move into a nursing home. Who wants to pick out their own clothes anyway?\n\nSo how come so many fashion designers are Jewish?\n\nRalph Lauren. Donna Karan. Isaac Mizrahi. Kenneth Cole. Michael Kors. Marc Ecko. And Calvin Klein, of course.\n\nAnd these are just the ones we've HEARD of.\n\nWe could say more, but then we'd have to understand fashion. And as we just said... we don't.",
