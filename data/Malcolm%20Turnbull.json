  "description": "G'day, Mr. Turnbull! Thanks for coming to our little corner of the Internet, mate! How ya doin'?\n\n(For those not up on down under politics, Malcolm Turnbull is the new Prime Minister of Australia. Why are we welcoming him to our website?)\n\nAs we understand, mate, you think you're part Jewish. Here's a direct quote: \"My mother always used to say that her mother's family was Jewish.\" Ripper!\n\nAnd then, the follow-up: \"I've never researched it. I honestly don't know where or how I would do that.\" Crikey!\n\nYou've heard of the Internet, mate? They got all kinds of gnarly websites that help you research your ancestry. We're not one of those, mate. But if you google \"Malcolm Turnbull Jewish\", you will probably end up here.\n\nOi! Until you do that research, mate, we can't really take your mum's word, and can only mark you \"Not a Jew\". Give us a holler if anything changes.\n\nNo worries!",
