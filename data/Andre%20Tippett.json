  "description": "We have a lot of difficulty issuing a verdict for people who convert to Judaism because of marriage. How do we really know how serious they are? Is the conversion just an act to pacify their significant other, or a full-pledge devotion into Judaism?\n\nIt's not like we can look up on Connie Chung's synagogue attendance or make sure that Tom Arnold has no bacon in his fridge. In fact, we don't want to. Especially not the latter.\n\nBut in case of former NFL linebacker Andre Tippett, no further evidence is needed. The ex-New England Patriot converted for his wife, and has embraced his new faith. He is active on the Jewish speaking circuit, goes to temple, speaks fondly of Jewish traditions, and raises his kids as Jews.\n\nAnd considering that the last thing we want to do is to anger a 6'3\", 240 lbs Pro Football Hall of Famer, the verdict here is obvious.",
