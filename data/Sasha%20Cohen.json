  "description": "Sasha Cohen must rue the day of November 3, 2006.\n\nNo, that's not the day when she lost the US Figure Skating Championship to judge's pet Michelle Kwan. On that day, \"Borat\" came out.\n\nImmediately, Sasha Cohen became the world's second most famous Sasha Cohen.\n\nOh sure, prior to the movie's release, Sacha Baron Cohen had a following (although he was mostly known for his other character, Ali G). And sure, he spells his name a little differently. Do you think it really mattered to Sasha since every one of her skating performances  must now include an obligatory joke about the mustached Kazakh?\n\nWell, there are two ways out for poor Sasha. She could just use her full first name, Alexandra. Or she could hope \"Br\ufffdno\" bombs, knocking Baron Cohen off his pedestal.\n\nNo, honestly, you think it's a coincidence that she hasn't competed since 2006?",
