  "description": "Young actress Mikey Madison (you might have seen her as one of Pamela Adlon's daughters on \"Better Things\") is getting a lot of Oscar buzz for her titular role in \"Anora\". She plays a prostitute.\n\nIf she does win, it will not be the first time an Oscar goes to someone playing a prostitute! Jane Fonda in \"Klute\", Mira Sorvino in \"Mighty Aphrodite\", Kim Basinger in \"LA Confidential\", Charlize Theron in \"Monster\"... There are more, if you're willing to go down that rabbit hole and determine if a specific character is indeed a prostitute. We decided not to.\n\nMadison won't even be the first Jew to win for playing a prostitute, as one of Elizabeth Taylor's Oscars came for \"BUtterfield 8\". (She would be the first Jewish-born, natch, but we will never discount the incomparable Liz Taylor.)\n\nBefore we get ahead of ourselves... Madison hasn't even been nominated yet, and her character in the movie claims she is not a prostitute, but a stripper. Let's see if she does in fact win before we enter the rabbit hole to research Oscar-winning strippers...\n\n(Editor's update, March 2, 2025: She won! Down the rabbit hole we go?)",
