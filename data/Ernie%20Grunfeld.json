  "description": "Today, we will try to figure out the greatest Romanian NBA player ever. Why Romanian? We'll explain soon enough.\n\nThe choice is barren: it's between Ernie Grunfeld and Gheorghe Muresan.\n\nGrunfeld, whose Jewish family (aha!) emigrated to the US when he was a child, was a huge star at the University of Tennessee. His NBA career, however, was rather underwhelming. He spent nine nondescript years with the Bucks, Kings, and Knicks.\n\nMuresan, the tallest player in NBA history, did not go to college. As far as we know, his amateur career consisted of rescuing cats from Romania's tallest trees. His time in the NBA was very average: six mediocre seasons with the Bullets and Nets.\n\nSo, do we have to look past their playing days? Grunfeld moved to the front office. After stints as GM of the Knicks and Bucks, he is now in charge of the Wizards. The less said about his managing career, the better.\n\nOn the other hand, Muresan starred as the titular \"My Giant\" with Billy Crystal.\n\nWe're gonna go with Grunfeld.",
