  "description": "We have a problem.\n\nWe really like Alan Rickman, especially when he's playing a villain. From \"Die Hard\" to \"Robin Hood\" to \"Dogma\" to \"Harry Potter\". Even \"Love Actually\". Yeah, we admit it. We liked \"Love Actually\", and we liked Alan Rickman in it. You have a problem with that?\n\nActually, it seems like a lot Jews DO have a problem with it. Here are the following descriptions of Rickman by our fellow Jews: \"Anti-semite.\" \"Douchebag.\" \"Channeling his inner Hitler.\"\n\nAnd why?\n\nApparently Rickman wrote, directed, and produced a one-woman play that is supposedly anti-Israeli, which leads to it obviously being anti-semitic, which leads to it being the worst thing since Mein Kampf.\n\nUgh.\n\nWe haven't seen the play, nor are we planning to. (One-woman performances are not exactly our cup of tea. Actually, one-man performances really aren't, either.) And we could spend the next decade discussing how being critical of Israel is not exactly the same as being anti-semitic. But...\n\nWell, we can't help but be a little let down. It seems we only really liked Rickman when he was a fictional villain instead of a real-life one.",
