  "description": "The 2005 Pro Football Hall of Fame class contained three of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.\n\nDan Marino (Not a Jew). Career leader in most passing statistics, including yards and touchdowns.\n\nSteve Young (Not a Jew). Best quarterback rating of all-time.\n\nAnd Benny Friedman.\n\nWho?\n\nWell, let's put it this way. Most of Marino's career numbers have already been eclipsed by Brett Favre (Not a Jew). Young's passer rating will definitely be broken one day. But in the 1920s, Friedman was a transcending player of Babe Ruth (Not a Jew) proportions.\n\nIn 1928, he was so good for the Detroit Wolverines (yes, Detroit actually had a winning team back then), that next year, the entire team was bought by the New York Giants so that they could have the rights to Friedman (just try to imagine that happening now). Next year, he threw for 20 touchdown passes. The runner-up? Six. (In fact, no one would get to 20 until 1942.) Oh, and he also kicked 20 extra points. Imagine Dan Marino doing that.\n\nSo that begs the question. Friedman retired as a player in 1934. His Hall of Fame election came 71 years later, posthumously.\n\nSeriously... What took so long?",
