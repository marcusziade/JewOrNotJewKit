  "description": "A few years ago, college basketball player Sandy Cohen caught our attention. (His name sounds like something out of a Philip Roth novel!) Sandy is part Jewish, part Native American, so perfect fodder for JONJ. Unfortunately, he never made the NBA and had to turn to Israel to make it as a professional. So, Sandy Cohen: yet another average half Jewish, half Native American basketball player...\n\nNot so Natisha Hiedeman! In college, she was the Big East Player of the Year. Hiedeman was then drafted into the WNBA, where she has now spent four years with the Connecticut Sun. This season, she is a starter on one of the best teams in women's basketball. And, yes, Hiedeman is also part Jewish... we are not sure about Native American, but this is not NativeAmericanOrNotNativeAmerican.com.\n\nSo what does Sandy Cohen have to do with Natisha Hiedeman? They are half siblings! Their father is named... Sandy Cohen.\n\nAre we sure that's not a character in a Philip Roth novel?",
