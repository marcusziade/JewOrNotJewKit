  "description": "The Germans are very very good at luge. (Also beer. And leather shorts. What, you were expecting something else? It's not THAT type of the profile.)\n\nAnyway, luge. Germans have won something like 60% of all-time Olympic luge medals. This doesn't include the pseudo-German Austrians and Italians (all Italians that are good at luge come from the country's German-speaking region). Add up those, and we're around 85%.\n\nIn fact, America, for all its sporting prowess elsewhere, had not won a luge medal until 1998. Then, in an absolute shocker, they got both silver and bronze in the doubles. (Germany took the gold, natch.) One of those silver medalists was Gordy Sheer, who, we are willing to bet, is the only Jewish luge medalist ever. (We can probably discount all those Germans.)\n\nAs for 2018 Olympics, Americans did get another silver, but nine of the 12 medals went to Germans (or Austrians). Will another Jew ever join Sheer? He would probably have to move to Germany...",
