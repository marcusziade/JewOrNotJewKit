  "description": "You gotta hand it to Bill Clinton. He had a chance to make two appointments to the Supreme Court, and he made the best of both of them.\n\nNo, dear conservative readers, not because both Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer tend to lean left. (Oh, who are we kidding! That's part of it! Let us have our biases, dear conservative readers!)\n\nIt's because both Ginsburg and Breyer are Jewish. That's right, Bill Clinton went two for two when he had the chance, picking the sixth and seventh Jewish Supreme Court judges in US history.\n\nFor the record, the first five were: Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, the delightfully named Felix Frankfurter, Arthur Goldberg, and Abe Fortas (not to be confused with Abe Froman, the sausage king of Chicago).\n\nIn fact, Fortas succeeded Goldberg, who succeeded Frankfurter, who succeeded Cardozo, giving rise to the nickname of the \"Jewish seat\". Perhaps it's time to resurrect that, President Obama? You don't want Bill Clinton to be getting all the JONJ praise, do you?\n\n(Editor's update: this was written before Elena Kagan. Good job, Barack!)",
