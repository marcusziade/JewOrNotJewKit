  "description": "We're all gonna die one day. Sorry to begin with such a downer.\n\nSo how about this for an upper: in the last century alone, numerous advances have been made in curing diseases and increasing the average lifespan. It it guaranteed to even get better in the future. If only we can get into that future...\n\nWell, you can! Sort of. Just get yourself cryogenically frozen right after you die, and then hope that the future has cures for whatever ailed you (including old age, natch).\n\nSounds like a bunch of tomfoolery? Perhaps, but what do you have to lose? At least that was the opinion of Robert Ettinger, who was in a middle of a midlife crisis. Some people simply buy a yellow sports car; Ettinger came up with the concept of cryonics, publishing the book \"The Prospect of Immortality\" in 1962 and even becoming a minor celebrity. With time, more and more people decided to get themselves frozen. Ted Williams and Marvin Minsky are perhaps the most famous cases.\n\nNaturally, Ettinger followed suit in 2011. If it all does work out, once he thaws out, he'll even have a choice of which ex-wife gets to join him.\n\nSorry to end with such a downer...",
