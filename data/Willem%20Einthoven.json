It's the EKG monitor, measuring heart activity. BEEP!\n\nThere were number of attempts to create a heart monitor in the late 19th century. BEEP! It wasn't until 1901 that Dutch doctor Willem Einthoven proved to be successful. BEEP!\n\nIn 1924, he won the Nobel in Medicine for it. BEEP! The system has been modified over the years, but much of Einthoven's principles are still used today. BEEP!\n\nAnother great Jewish invention? BEEP! Well, Einthoven was just a quarter, and was definitely not raised Jewish.\n\nIn fact... wait a minute, wasn't there supposed to be a beep there? What we're saying is that Einthoven had a Jewish grandfather, wait, seriously, where is the sound? The profile is on its last legs as is... Where are you, beep? beeeeeeeeee...",
