  "description": "Sven Hedin lived a fascinating life. In his youth, the Swede explored Central Asia: Turkestan and Tibet, Azerbaijan and Mesopotamia, India and Siberia. He discovered the sources of major rivers, as well as the Transhimalaya mountain range. He was honored by kings and shahs, presidents and popes.\n\nOh, and did we mention that he had Jewish heritage? Although he was Lutheran, Hedin actually descended from the founder of Sweden's Jewish community.\n\nSo why such a low K Score?\n\nYou see, besides royalty, Hedin had another admirer: Adolf Hitler. And, what makes it worse, the admiration was reciprocated.\n\nYep, our part-Jewish explorer was quite taken with National Socialism. Hedin and Hitler were even pen pals.\n\nNow, before we get on Hedin's case, he became highly critical of the Nazis when their antisemitic plans became evident. He even used his clout to help a number of incarcerated Jews.\n\nStill, we're not exactly kvelling.",
