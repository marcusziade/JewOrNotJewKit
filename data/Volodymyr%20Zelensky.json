  "description": "When this profile was first written, back in 2019, it made light of Volodymyr Zelensky, comparing his surprising rise to power to a rather forgettable Robin Williams film, \"Man of the Year\". Well, much has changed. And no, we're not talking about Zelensky's role in Trump Impeachment #1. (Hey, Jew or Not Jew in 2019: there will be TWO Trump impeachments! Who saw that coming? Well, a lot of people...)\n\nWe're talking about Zelensky's role in defending Ukraine from the despicable attack by Russia. Dwarfed by a massive army and left alone by the world's superpowers, Zelensky is rising above and beyond what anyone expected.\n\nIt's quite amazing, really. Here is an obscure, Jewish, Russian-speaking (Zelensky did not even speak Ukrainian until his run for president!) comedian who is leading his nation's fight against the menace of Russia.\n\nAs of this writing, Ukraine is still standing strong under Zelensky's leadership. Let's hope we don't need to rewrite this profile once again.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!",
