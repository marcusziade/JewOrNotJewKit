  "description": "Of all the kings of ancient Israel, Zimri is one of the most fascinating.\n\nAround 880 BCE, the king of Israel's northern kingdom was Elah. Zimri was his chariot commander, who staged a coup in a rather decisive way: by stabbing Elah to death.\n\nZimri proclaimed himself king and promptly killed Elah's entire family. Alas, his reign didn't last long. Elah's supporters surrounded the palace, and Zimri burned it down, killing himself in the fire. He ruled for all of seven days.\n\nWhat, you expected a longer profile?",
