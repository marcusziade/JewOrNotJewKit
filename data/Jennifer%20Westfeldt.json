  "description": "It's hard to think of a Jewier recent movie than \"Kissing Jessica Stein\", written by and starring Jennifer Westfeldt. (Yes, we realize it's more than a decade old, but we just saw it for the first time. It's recent to us.)\n\nA New York backdrop. A klutzy, neurotic, forever late, incredibly picky Jewish woman who works as a writer, buries herself in books, and just can't find a man. Her doting mother who has all but lost hope. A father who doesn't say a word throughout the film. An older brother who has found love. A snarky, yet possibly interested, Jewish, boss. A baby-having Jewish — wait, is everyone in this movie Jewish? — best friend.\n\nA Shabbat dinner where the mother tries to set the daughter up with an older, respectable gentleman. And then — the torrid affair with a goyishe (oh, so goyishe!) love. And, yes, everyone is initially shocked, but Jews being Jews, they learn to love and accept.\n\nOh, and it's about lesbians. So what?",
