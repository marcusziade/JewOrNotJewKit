  "description": "Let's say you find yourself in the capital of Switzerland, Bern — a lovely country, a lovely city — strolling down a boulevard, when you see a medieval fountain. Lovely, you say, and stop by to take a closer look.\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\n\nNo, your eyes are not deceiving you. That is Kindlifresserbrunnen, which is German for \"Child Eater Fountain\". Those Germans sure have a way with words!\n\nHere is where it gets sketchy (alright, it already got VERY sketchy): no one is exactly sure what the Kindlifresserbrunnen is supposed to represent. Ah, crap. You know what's coming, right?\n\nYep. One theory says that's a Jew eating Christian babies. Just look at that medieval Jewish hat!\n\nThere are other theories too. It might be the demon Krampus, eating children on Christmas. (So, again, Christian children.) It might be the Greek titan Cronus, devouring his children. It might be Swiss army commander Cardinal Schiner, who presided over many deaths, or it might be the brother of the founder of Bern, who some say was a cannibal. It might just be an ogre.\n\nWe're really hoping it's just an ogre.",
