  "description": "Would you like to taste some jewfish? Well, you can't!\n\nNo, the swimming behemoth (they measure over eight feet!) did not go extinct. The are no more jewfish because the American Fisheries Society decided that the name was not culturally appropriate.\n\nWhy was the jewfish called that? Nobody knows for sure. It might have been originally called \"jawfish\", and the a flipped to the e. It might come from Italian \"giupesce\" for \"bottom fish\". Or it might have been so undelicious that it was deemed edible only for Jews. (Hey, at least it's kosher...)\n\nIn any case, thanks to the Society, goodbye jewfish, hello Atlantic goliath grouper!\n\nOne small problem: apparently, Australian fishermen are not as up on their political correctness as their American counterparts. The land down under features not one, but three different species that are called \"jewfish\".\n\nWould you like to taste some jewfish? Come to Australia!",
