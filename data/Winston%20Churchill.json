  "description": "Winston Churchill was part black?\n\nWinston Churchill was part American Indian?\n\nWinston Churchill was part Jewish?\n\nNot bloody likely. The rumor stems from an article that claims that Winston's mother, Jennie Jerome, was once called Jennie Jacobson. (Obviously, a potentially pseudo-Jewish last name is all the claim one apparently needs.) The article conveniently forgets that the Jeromes trace their lineage to Huguenot Timothy Jerome, who came to America in the early 18th century. (These are flimsy Jewish rumors. Convenient forgetfulness is the norm.)\n\nWinston Churchill was dyslexic?\n\nWinston Churchill was an alcoholic?\n\nWinston Churchill was born in a women's bathroom?\n\nDon't look at us, we're not the ones making these up!",
