  "description": "Every year the Nobels come out, the question is not will Americans win any scientific prizes, it's how many Americans will win.\n\nThat wasn't the case early on. In fact, from the Nobels inception in 1901 to 1907, no American won until...a scientific Nobel. This changed when Albert Abraham Michelson took home the Physics prize.\n\n\nAh, crud. Teddy Roosevelt just had to ruin it all, didn't he. Peace Prize in 1906? How many innocent buffaloes did he have to slay to win that?\n\nAlright, let's fix it. This should do it.\n\nMichelson, who was born in Prussia but came to America at the age of two, figured out the speed of light. You know that pesky c in Einstein's e=mc2? Michelson measured it, and pretty much nailed it, paving the way for Americans — and Jewish Americans — who had won scientific Nobels since.\n\n\nfunction load() {\n s1.style.display = 'inline';\n s2.style.display = 'none';\n s3.style.display = 'inline';\n s4.style.display = 'none';\n s5.style.display = 'inline';\n}",
