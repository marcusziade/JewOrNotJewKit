  "description": "Is it possible to be an atheist Jew? Absolutely. There are countless examples of people who are Jewish ethnically but do not believe in G-d. We put ourselves sometimes in that category... especially when our favorite sports teams continue to lose.\n\nBut is it possible to be a Jewish atheist? That seems a contradiction. For one cannot acquire Jewish ethnicity, and if one converts to Judaism, doesn't that stop them from being an atheist?\n\nA bit confusing, we know. But not much more confusing than the supposed Jewish conversion of French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre, who wasn't Jewish ethnically, was an atheist to the core.\n\nSupposedly, a month before his death, Sartre showed an interest in Judaism. But, from what we can gather, an interest is all that was; Sartre did not consider himself a Jew... he was just Jew-curious.\n\nAbsurd? Confusing? Well, that's existentialism for you.",
