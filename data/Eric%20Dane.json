  "description": "We were first going to profile Eric Dane a decade ago, but for some reason, we didn't. Strange, because he checks all the boxes: back then, he was best known for starring as McSteamy on the hit show \"Grey's Anatomy\", and despite being deceptively goysihe-looking, Dane is actually Jewish.\n\nSince then, McSteamy was written off. Dane embarked on an unremarkable run of titles that you have never heard of, probably wishing he was back on \"Anatomy\". So it made little sense to profile him in those years.\n\nRecently, Dane has finally found a juicy role, starring on \"Euphoria\" as Cal Jacobs. Of course, \"Euphoria\" being \"Euphoria\", Dane appears on a sex tape with drug use and much frontal nudity.\n\n... Which harks back to 2009, when, in real life, Dane appeared on a sex tape with drug use and much frontal nudity.\n\nWhy did it take us so long to profile Eric Dane?",
