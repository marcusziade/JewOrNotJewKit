  "description": "Tonga: a tiny South Pacific island nation, Oceania's only kingdom, population 100,000. Jews? Ha!\n\nWhile Tonga's list of practicing Jews probably numbers in the single digits, there are numerous Tongans of Jewish ancestry. It all started with Paul Samuel Bloomfield, an American who sailed to the island in the 19th century abroad the USS Ohio warship. He liked it so much that he decided to stay.\n\nPaul married a local woman and was... quite prolific. According to one relative, \"there is hardly a village in Tonga without a descendant of Paul Samuel Bloomfield\". Paul's progeny have been active in various aspects of Tongan life, from politics, to religion (no, they didn't stay Jewish), to... well, here is an interesting one: sport.\n\nTevita Tuamoheloa Bloomfield played for the Tongan national rugby team in the 1970s and 80s. His biggest claim to fame is starting what has been called \"the worst brawl ever seen on a rugby field\" when he chased a Welsh player into the stands.\n\nHa, indeed.",
