  "description": "It's safe to admit it now.\n\nWe liked \"Married... with Children\". The show, deemed crass and sophomoric during its run, is now considered groundbreaking. Together with \"The Simpsons\", it helped launch the Fox Network into the juggernaut that it is today (which, in turn, gave us \"Joe Millionaire\" and \"Tempation Island\", but we digress).\n\nWhat's there not to like about \"Married... with Children\"? The show centered around Al Bundy, a dim-witted depressed shoe salesman living off his high school memories. You laughed at Al. You felt for Al. As far as sitcoms go, it was a quality show (at least until the master shark jumper, Ted McGinley, joined the cast).\n\nWell, if there was one thing we didn't like, it was Al's wife, Peggy. The bouffant-haired bimbo spent her whole days on the couch, eating bon-bons, spending all of Al's money, and not once cooking him dinner. There's nothing funny about that.\n\nAnd nothing Jewish about that either. (Jewish wives cook. Oh, do they ever cook.) Yet, in a so-familiar twist, the actress who played Peggy, Katey Sagal, is Jewish.\n\nIt's safe to admit it now.",
