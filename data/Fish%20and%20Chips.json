  "description": "English food sucks. Black pudding, kidney pie, spotted dick (look that one up, please), it's all awful. There is one exception:\n\nFish and chips.\n\nOf course, it's just battered fried fish with fries (Yes. FRIES.) on the side, but the combination works. The English got one right.\n\nWell, English Jews, that is. That's right, fish and chips was invented by Jews! Deep-fried fish by itself was brought to England by Jews in the 16th century. And in 1860, Joseph Malin, Jew, had the great idea to couple that fish with fries (Yes. FRIES.) for a savory combination. English people have been eating it ever since.\n\nSo, hooray for good English (Jewish) food! One thing concerns us, however...\n\nHow come we gave fish and chips to the English, but got ourselves stuck with gefilte?",
