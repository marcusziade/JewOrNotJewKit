  "description": "We wanted to see if the recent movie \"Disobedience\", about Jewish women in London, is available on Netflix, so we began to type the name into the search box. As we started with \"Dis\", Netflix started to show us everything Disney, but soon as we got to the \"o\", it switched to, well... this:\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It should be obvious. What's going on, Netflix?\n\nYes, we know: \"Disobedience\" is a movie about two Jewish LESBIAN women, played by two Rachels: Weisz and McAdams (one guess which one is not Jewish in real life), so this explains the results of the search. But here's our question:\n\nNetflix assumes that people who want to watch \"Disobedience\" want to watch a movie about lesbians. Why doesn't it think that we want to watch a movie about... Jews?\n\nP.S. Clearly, they didn't have \"Disobedience\" available. Oh well.",
