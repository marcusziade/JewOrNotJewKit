  "description": "A week ago, Gabrielle Giffords was just your average Arizona congresswoman. Your run-of-the-mill, Democrat, pro-gun, pro-immigration-control, married to an astronaut, practicing Jew (half by birth, on her father's side) congresswoman.\n\nHer odds of being profiled on our website? Close to nil. Not to take anything away from her; from all accounts, Giffords is a bright woman, who many thought would rise through the ranks to higher offices. But we are not gonna profile every congressperson in this country, no matter how many astronauts they marry. We haven't even gotten through all the Jewish senators and governors yet.\n\nToday, Gabrielle Giffords is being profiled on our website. And it's not for anything she did — it's for being the target of an assassination attempt that took the lives of six and wounded 14 others, including Giffords.\n\nAnd if we wrote this a week ago, we'd discuss that Giffords is a perfect example that one doesn't need a Jewish mother to be a Jew — for she considers herself Jewish \"without any equivocation\". Today, all we can do is lament our country's many problems, shed a tear for the victims, and hope for Giffords — and others — recovery.\n\nAnd hope that we don't have to write any OTHER unexpected profiles any time soon.",
