  "description": "NHL's decision to pull out of the 2022 Olympics meant that the fans will be denied the opportunity to see the world's best hockey players in China. They will have to settle for second-best. Well, maybe not even that.\n\nWhile teams like Sweden, Czech Republic, and (ahem) the Russian Olympic Committee have the ability to draw players from their local leagues, such luxuries are not really available for Canada and the US. So their rosters can be broken up into three categories: amateur collegians, minor leaguers, and journeymen who now play in Europe.\n\nTo witness, Canada has:\n\nDevon Levi, 20-year-old goaltender who plays for Northeastern University\nJoshua Ho-Sang, 26-year-old once highly-touted prospect who flamed out of the NHL and is now in the minors\nJason Demers, 33-year-old veteran of 699 NHL games who currently plays in Russia\n\nWould you believe that all three are Jewish?\n\nPerhaps there is a benefit to the NHL pulling out of the Olympics after all...",
