  "description": "We get a lot of emails in our suggestion box. They range from brilliant to downright strange. For instance, many people ask us to profile... themselves.\n\nWhen they do, we shrug our shoulders and move on. As much as we like our readers, we're not going to profile them. They are not exactly famous.\n\nTake this letter. It comes from Dave, who says: \"Both parents fully Jewish. Yeshiva bucha in grade school. Awarded best student of Hebrew in high school. I continue to have a very strong identification with the Jewish people.\" These are all great things, but they don't get you profiled.\n\nBut this part does: \"I used to play in the NBA â€” Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks. 7 feet tall. Only Jew in the league at the time. Played in ABA with Carolina Cougars in 1970-71. All-American at Columbia 1965-66.\"\n\nWell, you don't say, Dave! In fact, from the looks of it, you are the tallest Jew in NBA history. You get your profile!\n\nPerhaps our other famous readers will now come out of the woodwork?",
