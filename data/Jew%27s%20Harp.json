  "description": "The musical instrument pictured on the left is known as \"arpa de boca\" in Spanish, \"Maultrommel\" in German, \"guimbarde\" in French, \"scacciapensieri\" in Italian, and \"vargan\" in Russian. \"Jew's Harp\" in English? What gives?\n\nUnsubstantiated theory #1: while England's goyim played the majestic regular harp, Jews were reduced to using this rather crude mouth organ.\n\nUnsubstantiated theory #2: it was originally called the \"jaw's harp\", but somehow a letter got swapped.\n\nUnsubstantiated theory #3: it's actually \"juice harp\", because of the drooling that accompanies playing it.\n\nUnsubstantiated theory #4: it was cheaply made and therefore a Jew's harp, as opposed to something more valuable.\n\nUnsubstantiated theory #5: it was imported or sold in England by Jews.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary is placing its bets at #5. Still... what gives?",
