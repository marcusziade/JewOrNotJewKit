  "description": "Hugo Gernsback is called by some \"The Father of Science Fiction\".\n\nThe Luxembourgian-born Jew did not foretell the future like Jules Verne or H. G. Wells. He wasn't a brilliant author like Isaac Asimov or Douglas Adams. In fact, his own writing career was rather forgettable.\n\nGernsback published magazines, including the first ever devoted entirely to science fiction: Amazing Stories, back in 1926. His influence was so wide-reaching that the famed award for science fiction writing carries his name: the Hugos.\n\nHe also invented these.\n\nThese are television goggles, created by Gernsback in the 1960s. Think they look stupid? You're not alone. They constantly make the list of the worst inventions of all time.\n\nAnd yet, think about it. Isn't wearable technology the supposed way of the future? Don't Gernsback's goggles resemble Google Glass?\n\nThe Father of Science Fiction, indeed.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\n swapPic('h/hugo_gernsback', 'gernsback');\n}",
