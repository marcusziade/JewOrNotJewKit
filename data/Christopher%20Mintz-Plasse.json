  "description": "Who didn't love Hebrew school? What better ways to spend Sunday mornings, right?\n\nAnd if you loved Hebrew school, the recent \"Year One\" was a film with a great premise: two cavemen, played by Jack Black and Michael Cera, wander through history and meet various Biblical figures. Unfortunately, it's a pretty terrible movie.\n\nIn the film, the protagonists run into Abraham, about to sacrifice his son Isaac, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, best known as McLovin in \"Superbad\". Everyone remembers the Abraham story from Hebrew school, right? It's one of our least favorites in the entire Bible. Even if we include the New Testament. On second thought, let's not include the New Testament.\n\nMintz-Plasse, however, had no idea. One of the most important stories in Jewish lore was complete news to him. In fact, he had to study up for the role. Good thing he's not a method actor, huh? And yet, despite all that (and the super goyishe name), Christopher is Jewish.\n\nWell, at least he was spared Hebrew school.",
