  "description": "As previously mentioned, we're not exactly big fans of most things on television nowadays. That includes \"Dancing with the Stars\".\n\nFirst of all, why dancing? Why not Bowling with the Stars? Crocheting with the Stars? Taxidermy with the Stars? Dancing just seems so arbitrary.\n\nSecond of all, the stars. Whoever is producing the show should put that word in quotes, for it is used very loosely. Ted McGinley? Jane Seymour? Joey Lawrence? Mario Lopez? What is this, 1990? Steve Guttenberg? Seriously, Steve Guttenberg?\n\nSo yes, last year's winner, model-turned-TV host-turned-\"star\" Brooke Burke is Jewish. Our hearts are not exactly swelling up with pride over that one.",
