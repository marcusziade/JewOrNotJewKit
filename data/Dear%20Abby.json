  "description": "There comes a time in every parent's life that they must talk to their child about important choices. About difficult decisions that will have an impact on the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen hanging toilet paper, should the loose end lie on top of the roll or come under it?\n\n(And, dear Internet, let's get this one straight: it was NOT Dear Abby who got into hot water with the answer to this one. It was Ann Landers, and no, the twin sisters were not interchangeable. In fact, we're not even sure if Abby ever tackled the subject; after her sister's controversial answer and subsequent multiple turn-arounds, it was probably wisest to stay away.)\n\nIt's under.\n\nAlright, so maybe not all decisions are as difficult as some make them out to be.",
