  "description": "There was nothing on TV. We watched \"I Love the 2000s\".\n\nYou remember \"I Love the 70s\"? And \"the 80s\"? And \"the 90s\"? And \"the 90s, Part Deux\"? Well, they made one about the 2000s. We're in 2014 now, so it looks like the first decade is up for grabs.\n\nSo, what's there to love about the 2000s? Apparently, Jared from Subway, \"Grand Theft Auto\", Paris Hilton, poker, \"Twilight\", R. Kelly, \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\", Hannah Montana, \"Entourage\", and Livestrong bracelets. And a bunch of other stuff, all narrated by a bunch of nobodys with Twitter handles. Oh, and Twitter. The 2000s are about Twitter.\n\nWe're not proud of watching it. At least the 70s/80s/90s had the delightful Michael Ian Black providing tongue-in-cheek commentary. We kept waiting for him to show up here, but it looks like he decided to stay away. Wise choice, Michael Ian.\n\nDumb choice by us...",
