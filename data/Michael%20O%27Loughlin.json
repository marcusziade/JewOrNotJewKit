  "description": "Jewish.\n\nAboriginal.\n\nSports Star.\n\nWe're gonna let that sink in for a moment.\n\nNo, you read that right. Jewish, Aboriginal, sports star. And his name is... Michael O'Loughlin?\n\nFor fourteen years, O'Loughlin played Australian football (yes, the one with referees in fancy outfits) for the delightfully named Sydney Swans. O'Loughlin has played in more games and scored more goals than pretty much anyone in team history. So, yes, sports star.\n\nAmong the many awards won by O'Loughlin was being named to his sport's Indigenous Team of the Century. So, yes, Aboriginal.\n\nAnd then, O'Loughlin appeared on \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", the Australian version of the TV program that traces people's roots. He found out that he is part English, Irish (with that name, natch), and, as he calls it... \"a strong element of Hebrew\". So, yes, Jewish.\n\nJewish! Aboriginal! Sports Star!",
