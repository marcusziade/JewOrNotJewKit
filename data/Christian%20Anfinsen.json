  "description": "Semantics!\n\nChristian Anfinsen was Jewish. (Yes, CHRISTIAN. We'll get to the details soon.)\n\nChristian Anfinsen was a Nobel Prize winner.\n\nBut was Christian Anfinsen a Jewish Nobel Prize winner?\n\nAnfinsen, a Norwegian American, became a Jew in 1979. He underwent an Orthodox conversion upon marriage. His Nobel Prize in Chemistry came in 1972.\n\nSo no, Anfinsen wasn't a Jewish Nobel winner at the time of the award. But he did become a Jew seven years later. And not counting Anfinsen among Jews who won Nobels seems to do everyone a disservice...\n\nLet's just say that Anfinsen was a Jewish, Nobel Prize winner.\n\nSemantics!",
