  "description": "Today we'd like to tell you about several very important, very interesting Jews.\n\nOur first profilee was an early movie pioneer â€” cofounding the London Film Society in 1925. This fine fellow helped produce movies with Charlie Chaplin, HG Wells, and Alfred Hitchcock and was also one of Great Britain's first movie critics. \n\nOur second person to profile was a highly placed communist and Russian spy who infiltrated British government. Working under the codename \"Intelligentsia\", this man used his high-placed connections and blue-blood breeding (his father was a baron) to keep the Soviets well-informed during World War II and afterwards. He was even a recipient of the Iron Curtain equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize (The Lenin Peace Prize). \n\nOur final subject was the founder of the International Table Tennis Federation. While he didn't invent ping-pong, he was the first to codify the rules. He spent his whole life dedicated to the sport and to spreading it around the world, most notably to China where the game became an integral part of that country's culture. He started the World Table Tennis Championships and grew the ITTF to include over 160 member nations. He was elected to the International Table Tennis Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nSo who are all these amazing, controversial, successful Jews? Spoiler: It's all the same person. \n\nSeriously.",
