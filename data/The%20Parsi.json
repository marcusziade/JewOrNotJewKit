  "description": "The Parsi are an ethnic group with roots in Southwest Asia. They live in Iran and India, but are neither Mulsim nor Hindi; they are Zoroastrian. A hundred years ago, they were one of the largest non-native ethnic groups in England.\n\nThey were also a frequent target of racism. George Edalji, a half-Parsi man, was wrongfully accused of slaughtering animals in what might have been the first \"Trial of the (20th) Century\". In recent times, they are not as prevalent as before, but there are still a number of notable Parsis. Freddie Mercury, for one.\n\nAlright, let's get to the point. What do Parsis have to do with Jews?\n\nWhen the Portuguese made their way to India in the 1500s, they referred to Parsis as \"Jews\". Oh, they knew that they were not of the Hebrew faith, but somehow the name stuck. Even as the Parsi made their way to England, they were called \"Jews of India\"... which had a lot to do with their perceived success in business. They benefited(?) from the \"Jews are good with money\" stereotype. Or maybe it was the beards.\n\nIn any case, the Parsi, including Edalji and Mercury, are clearly not Jews. Yet, in a strange twist, this is not the first time we mention ZoroastrianOrNotZoroastrian.com...",
