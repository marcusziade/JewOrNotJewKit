  "description": "Regular readers remember that we recently started a quest to find the greatest Jewish soccer player ever. Mostly, to give ourselves an excuse to write about soccer. There are worse subjects, after all.\n\nBut some of our soccer-loving readers thought that the quest was unnecessary. To them, the answer is simple: Yossi Benayoun.\n\nBenayoun, currently the captain of the Israeli national team, is a sublime midfielder who has played for some of the best clubs in England. Deft on the ball, he seems to be able to score from anywhere on the field and plays with a flair not usually expected from Jews.\n\nSo what accolades has Benayoun won? What trophies has he helped his teams to?\n\nThere are not many. He won an Israeli championship early in his career, but ever since his move to England, the slate is sadly clean. As for the Israeli national team, they haven't exactly sniffed the World Cup.\n\nOf course, soccer is a team game, so obviously his lack of trophies doesn't solely rest on Benayoun's shoulders. Still, it does put a damper on the proclaiming him the greatest soccer Jew ever.\n\nBut don't worry, regular readers. We've had just enough of supposed Jewish soccer greats. Perhaps a quest for the greatest Jewish... canoer is in order?",
