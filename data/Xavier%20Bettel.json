  "description": "When he took the office of Prime Minister of Luxembourg in 2013, Xavier Bettel became the third ever openly gay head of government. In total, there have now been five, all in Europe: Luxembourg is joined by Iceland, Belgium, Ireland, and Serbia.\n\nIs that surprising? In this day and age? And if so, what's surprising, the fact there have been five, or the fact there have been ONLY five? (Remember, \"openly gay\". Ignore the Lincoln rumors, please. Now, James Buchanan, on the other hand...)\n\nNow, can we count Bettel as a Jewish head of government? He is only a quarter, does not practice Judaism, but does identify as Jewish...\n\nA gay Jewish head of government!\n\nCount us surprised.",
