The same man whose appearance on Saturday Night Live is not only unwatchable, but also despicable? Whose supposed comedy is filled with profanity and misogyny? Whose career has been in the gutter for two decades?\n\nYes, the one and only.\n\nOne of the greatest actors ever? Him? Why?\n\nWell, in the midst of all that profanity and misogyny, did you ever consider that the Italianess is an act? That Dice in real life is actually Jewish?\n\nExactly.",
