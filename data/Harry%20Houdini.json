  "description": "If you think of Renaissance Men, you might think of Leonardo da Vinci. But why not Harry Houdini?\n\nEscape artist extraordinaire. Exposer of charlatans. Silent movie star. Magazine publisher. Pioneer aviator.\n\nJew.\n\nThat's right, Harry Houdini, the man whose name became synonymous with magic, was really Ehrich Weiss, a Hungarian immigrant, and a son of a rabbi.\n\nSo as far as Renaissance Men go, we might not have Leonardo, but we definitely got Houdini. Not bad at all!",
