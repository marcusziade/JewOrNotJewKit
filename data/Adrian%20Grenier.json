  "description": "Adrian Grenier (who, for those who forgot, was on \"Entourage\", a show we're now ashamed to admit we once liked), once said a sentence never uttered by anyone before or since:\n\n\"In junior high, I wanted to be Jewish to fit in.\"\n\nWhat could have Grenier be thinking when he said it?\n\nHere at Jew or Not Jew, we've seen it all. We're familiar with the celebrity psyche. Heck, we've even encountered goyim who want to be Jewish. But here, we had to dig deeper.\n\nHere, we had to read read about Grenier's upbringing, both religious and secular. We learned about his childhood friends. We studied the demographics of the area he grew up in. We discovered the racial, ethnic, and sociological makeup of his junior high school. And, yes, we figured out why Grenier said what he did:\n\nHe was high.",
