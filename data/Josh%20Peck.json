  "description": "Apparently, there is a \"Turner \u0026 Hooch\" remake out there now. It's on Disney+ and everything. You know, \"Turner \u0026 Hooch\"? The 80s movie with Tom Hanks (Turner) and a dog (Hooch)? They are cops? It's from the days where Hanks was finding his footing as a comedic star? Ring a bell?\n\nPerhaps; perhaps not. Seriously, it's really hard to comprehend. Someone at Disney clearly thought that this is a good idea. That a middling, irrelevant, milquetoast 80s movie should somehow be a basis for a budding franchise. What's next? What, \"Three Men and a Baby\" has run its course?\n\nIn the remake, Hanks is gone, of course, replaced by Josh Peck. Peck rose to relative fame as a child star on Nickelodeon's \"Drake \u0026 Josh\" (he was Josh?), and is Jewish, which is nice, we guess. Hooch has been replaced by... another dog, obviously. RIP, original Hooch.\n\nBut maybe we're wrong to be snarky. This is Disney we're talking about! Disney knows what they are doing! Who knows, \"Turner \u0026 Hooch\" just might be the perfect type of intellectual property to turn on a new generation of fans to the adventures of a man and his dog!\n\nIf not, they can always remake \"Lassie\".",
