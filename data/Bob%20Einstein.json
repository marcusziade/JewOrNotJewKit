  "description": "It's not often that brothers have such different careers.\n\nEveryone knows Albert Brooks, writer, comedian, and actor. Few know that his brother is Bob Einstein, daredevil.\n\nEinstein, in the guise of Super Dave Osborne, has performed stunts all over the country. He had countless appearances on late night shows, starred in his own Nike commercials, was a spokesperson was seatbelt safety, and even had a short-lived Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nWhat's this? Super Dave is just an act? All his stunts ended in failure? Bob Einstein is just a... writer, comedian, and actor?\n\nIt's not often that brothers have such similar careers.",
