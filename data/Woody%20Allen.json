  "description": "\"Woody Allen, I think, proved that a genius with a hard-on is still just a guy with a hard-on.\" — Bill Maher\n\nAt this point, taking shots at Woody Allen is like making Monica Lewinsky jokes — far too easy and painfully outdated. Suffice it to say, if this site was \"Creepy or Not Creepy\", Woody Allen would probably be in the Mel Brooks slot.\n\nIt doesn't help that many people see Allen as the prototypical Jew. In many ways, he's been selected to represent our people. And we're not sure we like the connotation. Ingenious? Sure. Funny? Great. Nervous? OK... Perverse? Um, no.\n\nSo what to do about the Jewish Jerry Lee Lewis? We're not willing to throw out Annie Hall along with Soon-Yi. A genius with a hard-on is just a guy with a hard-on. But that doesn't mean he isn't also still a genius, right?\n\nRight?",
