  "description": "What's the deal with this profile? Surely, this is a high score, but shouldn't it be even higher? Jerry Seinfeld is Jewish, acts Jewish, and based on previous raves about George Costanza and Larry David, is more than welcome in the tribe. Seriously, what's the deal?\n\nWell, there really is only one thing that keeps Jerry from achieving an even higher score. He's tried Scientology. The key word here is \"tried\", for it looks like that infatuation was a passing fancy, as he quickly turned his back away from the cult. But to give a perfect score to someone who considered Scientology? Even if it was a passing thought? Feh.\n\nBut without that fling, Jerry is just about a perfect JONJ candidate. Funny, successful, and oh so Jewish. He has even dropped the now-so-very annoying \"what's the deal\" routine. Aren't you glad we brought it back for this website?",
