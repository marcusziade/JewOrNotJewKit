A man named Joseph Reckendorfer.\n\nIn 1862, Reckendorfer spent a cool $100,000 (2.3 million in today's money) to buy a patent from the horrifically-named Hymen Lipman. Reckendorfer then proceeded to sue a company that was supposedly infringing on his right to exclusivity. The Supreme Court ruled against him, saying the patent was invalid. Reckendorfer was left with nothing.\n\nSo what patent did Reckendorfer waste his money on? Well, Lipman, a Jamaican-born Jew, came up with the idea of... putting erasers on pencils! Sadly for Reckendorfer, the Supreme Court said that this invention did not create any new functionality. Thankfully for Lipman, he already made his money.\n\nAs for those German mistakes? Alas, those are not that easy to erase.\n\nSorry, Lenny and Carl.",
