  "description": "We realized that we will never meet Saul Bellow's production.\n\nNo, not winning the Nobel Prize, although we realize that's not happening either. (At least not for literature... Maybe chemistry? We've been dabbling with some gene splicing in our basement. Oh-oh. We've said too much.)\n\nBesides, have you read the works of some of the recent Nobel Prize laureates? We're not gonna name any names here, but talk about laying it on thick. Putting on layers upon layers of subtext might win you some accolades, but it does not necessarily make you readable. (Bellow, on the other hand (winner in 1976), IS very readable despite his layers of subtext.)\n\nWhere were we? Oh yes, us never matching Saul Bellow's production.\n\nHe fathered a child at the age of 84.\n\nYeah... that's not happening.",
