  "description": "\"Eat your kishkes,\" Jewish mothers say. \"You want to grow big and strong.\" But most of us don't eat our kishkes. Kishkes are disgusting!\n\nThere are some exceptions, of course. Over a decade ago, we profiled football player Gabe Carimi, proclaiming him to be the \"biggest Jew\". Why? Well, at 6'7\", 315 lbs, good luck finding someone bigger!\n\nAlas, Carimi, a former first-round pick, flamed out of the NFL after four forgettable seasons. And we felt no need to revisit the subject... until now.\n\nJake Curhan of the Seattle Seahawks might just challenge Carimi for the title. He is an inch shorter, 6'6\", but he is listed a pound heavier: 316! Now, professional sports measurements are known to be misleading, so who knows for sure.\n\nUnlike Carimi, Curhan was not heavily touted coming out of college, signing with Seattle as an undrafted free agent. Still, he looks to be on the up-and-up and has a chance to best Carimi... on the playing field, if not necessarily on the measurement table.\n\nSeriously, those two must have very proud Jewish mothers.",
