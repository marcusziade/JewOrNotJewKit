  "description": "It's time for another installment of our \"Ask Jew or Not Jew\" feature, where young readers write in for advice. Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I don't know what to do! I just found out that I was adopted and that my birth parents are NOT Jewish! I already had my future planned out: I was going to attend Brandeis in the fall and go to dental school after that... Now, I have no idea what to do! Am I Jewish? Am I goy? Please help... â€” Jacob Lifschitz(?), 17, Brookline, Massachusetts\n\nDear Jacob,\n\nfirst of all, thank you for turning to us in a time of crisis. G-d knows, a somewhat humorous Jew-finding website is the place to answer such questions.\n\nYou really have to ask yourself, even with these findings, do you FEEL Jewish? Take a look at actor Orlando Bloom. When he was a child, he thought his father was Jewish novelist Harry Saul Bloom. But then his mother revealed that the real father is some goy named Colin Stone, a family \"friend\". Since then, Orlando has shed all Jewish roots, be they inherited or imagined. For him, it was the right thing to do. Stupid elf.\n\nSo we suggest to get a good night's sleep, wake up refreshed, look in the mirror, and ask yourself, do you see a Jew? And do let us know how it works out.\n\nBesides, believe it or not, goyim are allowed to be dentists as well.\n\nThanks again for writing,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
