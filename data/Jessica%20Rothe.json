  "description": "A couple of years ago, we got numerous requests to profile Jessica Rothe, star of the slasher film \"Happy Death Day\". Not being fans of the horror genre, so we noted that Rothe is short for Rothenberg, and went on our merry ways. But now she is back starring in the sequel, so the requests returned in full force.\n\nShort for Rothenberg... We've come a long way over the years, but actors still feel like they need to hide under a goyishe moniker. What, middle America still can't relate to something slightly Jewy? Can you imagine that conversation?\n\nGeez, honey, I was going to take you to this slasher flick, but I just don't know... That girl just might be one of them Jews! Gosh, you're right, precious, it's not like I have anything against those people, but, you know... Oh, I know, I know!\n\nThey are probably right. Can't take the risk of some rubes frowning their brow at a horror flick because it stars a potential Jew. There are dollars at stake here!\n\nWell, they are not getting our dollars! Not because Jessica is Jewish, of course. We just don't like horror movies...",
