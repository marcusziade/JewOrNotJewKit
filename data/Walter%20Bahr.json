The greatest American family in soccer? Well, yes, but also in football. We're confusing ourselves!\n\nWalter Bahr, who was not Jewish (despite a brief stint with Hakoah Montreal and some random claim that he came from a family of Galciian Jews) is considered one of the greatest players of American soccer's lost era (pretty much the majority of the 20th century). Bahr was part of the 1950 American team that improbably beat England at the World Cup. He was an Olympian as well.\n\nWalter's three sons, Casey, Chris, and Matt, also went into soccer. All three played in the old North American Soccer League, with Casey even playing in the 1972 Olympics. Unfortunately, the NASL proved to be a dud, so Chris and Matt switched to football. American football! Now it's becoming clear?\n\nChris kicked for three teams and won two Super Bowls with the Raiders. Matt kicked for six teams, most notably the Browns and Giants, and also won two Super Bowls. (Not with the Browns, duh.) So, yeah, let's call the Bahrs the greatest family in football, American.\n\nWe hope that wasn't confusing.",
