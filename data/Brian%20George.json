  "description": "If you are an ethnic actor, breaking through in Hollywood is not that simple. And once you do â€” hold on tight! OWN that ethnicity.\n\nTake Miguel Sandoval. You probably don't know him by his name, but you definitely know him by his face. He is Hollywood's go-to-guy for marginal Hispanic characters. He's played everyone from a Hispanic cockfighter to a Hispanic druglord. Oh, the range!\n\nAnd then we have Brian George. His range is even wider: he was a Pakistani restauranteur on \"Seinfeld\" and is an Indian doctor on \"Big Bang Theory\". Add to that various taxi drivers and convenience store owners, and the entire sub-continent stereotype is complete.\n\nThe punchline should be obvious by now. George is neither Indian nor Pakistani; he is an Israeli-born British Jew.\n\nBeats a Jewish cockfighter or druglord, we give you that...\n\nsetImage('babu.gif');",
