  "description": "Boy meets shiksa, boy marries shiksa, shiksa turns out to be a total bitch. A Jewish mother's worst nightmare? Yes, but also a plot of \"The Heartbreak Kid\" starring Ben Stiller.\n\n(A pretty terrible film, we might add. If we remember correctly, in the movie, Ben's fictional Jewish mother is dead. She can thank her fictional lucky stars that she missed out on this piece of dreck.)\n\nStiller's blond bitch shiksa wife is played by Malin Akerman. And boy, does she have it down pat. The shiksa part, that is. Although... Akerman? Could it be? After all, we've seen our share of blond Jews masquerade as goyim on the screen.\n\nNope... not a Jew. Swedish. Not exactly a surprise.\n\nWhat about this one? Boy meets shiksa, boy marries shiksa, boy and shiksa live happily ever after, surrounded by blond, blue-eyed, goyishe children...\n\nHard to tell which version is worse, right, Jewish mothers?",
