Seriously!\n\nSo who is deemed to be the best of the best of our wonderful state? (No, not Tony Soprano.) Bruce Springsteen, of course a first-ballot inductee. Thomas Edison, natch. Buzz Aldrin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Carl Lewis, Frank Sinatra, Meryl Streep, Walt Whitman, Woodrow Wilson... alright, let's get to the Jews.\n\nPresenting your New Jersey Jewish Hall of Famers... Albert Einstein! Carl Sagan! Jerry Lewis! (umm... well, they can't all be Einstein...) Judy Blume! Philip Roth! Michael Douglas! And the one inductee not yet profiled, Leon Hess, the one-time oil baron who owned the New York Jets and moved them to New Jersey in the 1970s.\n\nSo, you see, New Jersey is not just a great state, but a great Jewish state. Seriously, stop the snickering.",
