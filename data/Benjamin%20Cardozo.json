We're talking about the very important question, is Sotomayor the first Hispanic Justice?\n\nHow does that have anything to do with OUR website? Well, Sotomayor detractors claimed that the first Hispanic Justice was Benjamin Cardozo, who sat on the Supreme Court from 1932 to 1938.\n\nCardozo was a Jew with ancestry in the Iberian Peninsula. Did that make him Hispanic? (And, by extension, would it make ANY Sephardic Jew Hispanic? This might alter the way some people fill in their college applications.)\n\nWell, apparently Cardozo's ancestors came from Portugal, not Spain. Also, they haven't resided on the Iberian Peninsula since before the American Revolution, so...\n\nSeriously, why are we doing all the dirty work? Can someone start HispanicOrNotHispanic.com already?",
