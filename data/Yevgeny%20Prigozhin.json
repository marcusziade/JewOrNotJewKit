  "description": "For 24 hours, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a man who once made a living selling hot dogs, became the #1 topic on Earth. For those who are living under the rock (or are reading this years from now, when everyone has stopped giving a shit about Prigozhin), here's a rundown:\n\nPrigozhin in charge of the Wagner Group (named for, yes, THAT Wagner), a mercenary army made up of criminals (not even \"former\" criminals; they take people directly out of prisons) that has been utilized by Russia in its war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and Prigozhin used to be friends.\n\nThe past tense is important here, for, on June 23, 2023, Prigozhin decided that something is off. Supposedly, his soldiers were getting attacked by the non-mercenary Russians, so something had to be done. So he took his troops and stormed on old pal Putin and Russia. Soon, his soldiers occupied the rather large city of Rostov-on-Don and were moving in on Moscow.\n\nPutin immediately shat his pants and took off on a plane to parts unknown, while the rest of the world wondered: what is up with this guy? How far can he go? Can he actually make it to Moscow, and then... what? Is this a mutiny or the beginning of a civil war?\n\nIt fizzled out as quickly as it started. Apparently, Putin appeased Prigozhin (read: paid him off), and the troops turned back. No civil war. Barely a mutiny. Back to the status quo.\n\nAnd, yeah, Prigozhin is Jewish through his father. We mention that while people still give a shit...\n\n(Editor's update, August 23, 2023: It took Putin two months. So much for old pals!)",
