  "description": "We love watching Jeopardy!, but one thing annoys us to no end: Alex Trebek and his know-it-all attitude. It's easy to sound so smart when the answers are on the cards in front of you, Trebek!\n\nActually, another thing annoys us: the contestant interviews. How many awful hobbies or spouse-meeting stories do we need to hear, Trebek?\n\nThere are some exceptions, however. Take a recent interview, where the contestant talked about his love of Krav Maga, the Israeli martial art. (The contestant was Jewish, natch. So was Krav Maga inventor, Imi Lichtenfeld, natch. As a youth, he street fought antisemites, and used the tactics to develop the martial art.)\n\nSo why was the Krav Maga interview an exception to the usual contestant drudgery (other than the Jewish connection, natch)? Well, because Trebek had no idea what Krav Maga was.\n\nNot so smart without those cards, Trebek!",
