  "description": "In 1933, Helen Jacobs did something incredibly scandalous.\n\nShe wore shorts. Without stockings. Yes, that was a big deal at the time.\n\nWhat made it a big deal was that Jacobs wasn't a nobody. She was a top tennis player (although not openly Jewish, we can safely call her the best Jewish female player of all time), and the shorts (without stockings) were worn on the court.\n\nIn that attire, Jacobs repeated as US Open champion (she would end up winning four in a row). But soon after, a new challenge arose. Jacobs was to play Wimbledon.\n\nSurely, a lady wouldn't wear shorts (without stockings) in front of the queen? Oh, the humanity!\n\nJacobs did just that. And while she lost the final in 1934, she took the Wimbledon crown two years later. Jacobs beat Hilde Krahwinkel, who wore a skirt (and stockings).\n\nSo next time you hear criticism of female tennis attire...\n\nRemember, it's being going on for 80 years, starting with shorts (and no stockings).",
