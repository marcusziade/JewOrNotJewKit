  "description": "We've all gotten used to seeing teams throw away their money on less-than-deserving athletes. But all of us were a little shocked when Real Madrid dumped 68.5 million euros on Kaka.\n\nSome people say the best soccer player in all the world is Kaka. Then again, some people say the entire sport of soccer is Kaka. We aren't all soccer experts here at JONJ, so who are we to judge?\n\nCould Kaka be Jewish?\n\nWell that would depend on who made Kaka. In this case, no one Jewish was involved. At one point, there were rumors, but they're not true. Some people say Kaka belongs to Jesus. If you look at Kaka sometimes, you'd be forced to agree.\n\nRegardless, it seems a lot of people like Kaka and want to see more. The rest of us will just have to wait and see what floats to the top next.",
