  "description": "There is a new name of horror, and it's Jewish.\n\nThe name is Blumhouse, a production company that has made pretty much every recent horror movie. There are too many to mention (and, frankly, we don't like horror, but let's give it a whirl): \"Paranormal Activity\", \"Insidious\", \"The Purge\", \"Hush\", \"Ouija\", \"Get Out\", \"Happy Death Day\", the new \"Halloween\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"Freaky\"...\n\nThat's just the tip of the bloody iceberg; Blumhouse has put out a good dozen movies per year over the past decade. (They also produced \"Jem and the Holograms\". Weird.) It's even become a brand, with Blumhouse now clearly seen in advertisements as a synonym for horror.\n\nWhy is the name Jewish? Well, Blumhouse comes from founder and CEO Jason Blum, who is.\n\nAnd that's not scary at all.",
