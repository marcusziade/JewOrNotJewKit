  "description": "Did you know that a banana is \"the atheist's nightmare\"? Yes, a simple banana. We are not sure how many of you are atheists, but those foul fruits might be haunting your dreams!\n\nYou see, according to New Zealand preacher Ray Comfort... Wait, why are we profiling some Christian all the way from down under?\n\nDo you remember Kirk Cameron? The star of \"Growing Pains\"? The somewhat palatable sitcom from the late 80s / early 90s? Kirk Cameron? Yeah, he hasn't exactly had a career since then, because he dove head first into Comfort's \"The Way of the Master\" ministry. They are now partners in brainwashing.\n\nAnyway, Comfort claimed that a banana is a perfect example of intelligent design, with its thick, hard-to-open outer shell designed to protect the delicious innards. (As opposed, to you know... Jebus, just pick any fruit where the skin is edible: Peach? Strawberry? A freakin' apple? Anyway...) Little did Comfort realize that bananas, as we know them today, are a product of years of careful artificial selection. The original wild bananas are much smaller, full of big seeds, and are completely inedible.\n\nStill, this doesn't explain why we are profiling Ray Comfort. You see, Comfort follows a logic train worthy of his banana theory. \"Jesus was Jewish. All the disciples were Jewish. I am Jewish, and any Jew who believes the God-breathed Old Testament will embrace Jesus of Nazareth as their promised Messiah.\"\n\nRay Comfort is a dumbass.",
