  "description": "Jackson Pollock is overrated.\n\nYeah, we said it. What are you gonna do, fight us about it? Some art school nerd you are!\n\nNo, seriously, he is overrated. If you ask a Joe off the street to name a modern American artist (we would have to limit these streets to coastal cities), odds are they will go with Pollock. (Or Andy Warhol? Talk about another overrated one!)\n\nWhile we can't diminish Pollock's influence on abstract expressionism specifically and modern art in general, have you seen his work? Compare it side-by-side to another major American abstract expressionist, Lee Krasner. Similar in some ways, different in others, but one is definitely not inferior to the other. Why has Joe heard of Pollock and has not heard of Krasner?\n\nFor those who assume we're gonna claim antisemitism... Wrong! We're gonna claim sexism. Krasner had spent most of her life in Pollock's shadow. It was only recently that she started to get more recognition for her own contributions.\n\nPerhaps being married to Pollock had something to do with it...",
