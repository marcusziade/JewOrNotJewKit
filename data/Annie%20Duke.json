  "description": "Over 600 profiles ago, we added Mike Matusow. That sounds like a long time and it was (2.5 years, or about three millennia in Internet years). Here are a few things we've learned since then:\n\nWe've learned that if we write about how Jews need to murder more people, then no one pays attention. But if we show a picture of an older Elizabeth Taylor we're \"putzes.\" And you don't want to know what happened when we mentioned that Mel Gibson wasn't Jewish.\n\nWe've also learned we can write whatever the heck we want about politics, because either way we're betraying the Jewish people. Seriously.\n\nFinally, we've learned that there are plenty of Jewish poker players out there including today's profilee Annie Duke and her brother Howard Lederer (through their father, author and linguist Robert Lederer). Good poker players who behave appropriately at the table, win bracelets, and inspire us in our own (poor) attempts at playing the game.\n\nYes we've learned quite a bit since the early days of JONJ. But what is most worrisome? We've learned we actually kind of like Mike Matusow.\n\nSometimes it's just better not to know, y'know?",
