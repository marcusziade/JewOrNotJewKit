  "description": "Sometimes people tend to associate an actor with the characters they play. And you know what? That's ok. It happens. We've even done it ourselves a few times (although, in the case of someone like William Shatner it's probably for the best).\n\nBut sometimes — sometimes — people make an assumption that is so patently ludicrous it is impossible to be believed. For instance, thinking that the uber-goy pictured to the left might be anything even close to a Jew because he played one once.\n\nBrendan freakin' Fraser? Come on. Yes, he played landsman David Greene in School Ties. But playing a Jew doesn't make you one. \n\nBrendan has also played an adventuring archaeologist, a cartoon Canadian mountie, and a caveman. And we'd believe he was any of the above before we'd believe his mummy killing, caveman defrosting, ham consuming ass was Jewish.",
