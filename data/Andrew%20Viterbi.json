  "description": "You know what we can't live without? Wi-Fi. Two decades ago, we were perfectly fine to be tethered to a wall. Now we take our devices everywhere and simply don't think about it. It's Wi-Fi! Our kids can't imagine a world without it. \n\nHow does Wi-Fi work? We have no idea! It's... well, not magic... science! Hooray for science!\n\nHooray for Andrea (Andrew) Viterbi, an Italian-American Jew who developed an algorithm all the way back in 1967. You see, all that data has to be encoded, and the Viterbi algorithm (that's the name) figures out how to decode it and pull out important signals from all that noise. Eventually, that led to Wi-Fi. Thank Signore Viterbi, kids!\n\nWhat's this? We are hearing screams from across the house... did Wi-Fi just go out? Damn you, Wi-Fi!\n\nHow can we finish this profile without it?",
