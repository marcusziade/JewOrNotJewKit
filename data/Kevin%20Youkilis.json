  "description": "Sometimes you don't need to search a smarty-pants website. Sometime Denis Leary says something funny and it's plastered all over YouTube. So, yes, Youk's a Jew. Maybe not a practicing Jew or a good Jew or even a proud Jew. But he's a Jew.\n\nThe history of Koufax and Greenberg leads you to believe that it is the responsibility of the Jewish athlete to lead the way for the tribe. No one asks if Albert Einstein took a break from relativity on Yom Kippur. But Youkilis or Kapler or Ausmus or any other sporting Jew suits up on Shabbat and suddenly everyone starts acting like someone just urinated on the Torah.\n\nWould it be nice if Youkilis were into the Jew-thang? Yes, but it's pretty clear at this point that it ain't gonna happen and we're not going to cry into our matzoh ball soup over it. \n\nNot everyone can be team captain. If Youkilis wants to be the hard working quiet guy in the back of the Jewish locker room while more overt Jews like Shawn Green take center stage, we're fine with that. Honestly, it matches up with who he is as a ballplayer.\n\nWe're just happy to have him on the team.",
