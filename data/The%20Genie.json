  "description": "We looked high and wide for an animated Disney Jew. Big Bad Wolf, Seven Dwarfs, Lion King's Timon... And the most obvious Jew of them all was right under our nose.\n\nWe even mentioned him in passing in the Kronk Pepikrankenitz profile. Aladdin, Robin Williams: the Genie. A Jew. Such an obvious, obvious Jew.\n\nWhat's that, you say? How can the Genie, a character from Aladdin, a story from Arabian Nights (Allah be praised?), be Jewish?\n\nWell, it's pretty simple. Eric Goldberg, the Genie's animator, made him so. He created the character as a Jew. And Robin Williams' love of Yiddish shtick played right into the character, as the Genie spews Yiddish phrases time and time again.\n\nBut how do we reconcile a Jewish genie in Arabian Nights (Allah be praised?)? Well, it's simple, really. The Genie is a prisoner inside the lamp. And, according to Arabian Nights (Allah be praised?), genies get imprisoned by Arabian emperors they defy. And who better to defy an Arabian emperor than a Jew?\n\nOr... perhaps Goldberg just wanted to show that Jews and Arabs can get along, at least in a cartoon setting. Not exactly the worst idea, right?\n\nWe just never expected it to come from Disney.",
