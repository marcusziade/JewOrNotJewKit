  "description": "There is a 50% chance that at the Tokyo Olympics, we will be adding 24 Jewish medalists in one swoop. Alright, maybe 50% is stretching it a bit.\n\nThat being said, there are only six teams playing baseball in the Olympics, and Israel got the one bid reserved for Europe and Africa. (Take that, Tanzania!) Israel competes in Europe because the Arab countries of Asia are not exactly fans. It doesn't help in most sports, including soccer, but works out great in baseball!\n\nIt works out great because Israel is made up of AMERICAN Jewish minor leaguers and ex-major leaguers, who have used the Law of Return to obtain Israeli citizenship. The roster includes familiar names like Ian Kinsler, Danny Valencia, and Ryan Lavarnway. The latter, a journeyman catcher, has spent the last seven seasons on seven different teams... surely, the continuity of Israel will be a welcome change.\n\nOf course, with the other five teams being the US, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, Israel's chances at a medal are a long shot. That being said... crazier things have happened, right?\n\nCrazier things then 24 Jews winning a medal in one swoop?",
