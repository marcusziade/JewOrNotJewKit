  "description": "The woman pictured, Ruth Eisemann-Schier, is a pioneer.\n\nShe is a trailblazer. A groundbreaker. She is the first woman in history to make it to one of the most exclusive lists. And, yes, she is a Jew.\n\nEisemann-Schier was the first ever woman on FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.\n\nHow did she make it? In 1968, she and her boyfriend kidnapped an heiress for ransom. Ruth didn't stay on the list for long, as she was caught 79 days after the crime.\n\nSo let's celebrate yet another Jewish female achievement!\n\nWe kid, we kid. No one is celebrating Ruth Eisemann-Schier. It's a joke. Quit taking our website so seriously, will you?",
