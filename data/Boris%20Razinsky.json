  "description": "We were going to make a big deal about Boris Razinsky's snub, but it turns out we don't have to.\n\nRazinsky was a Soviet Olympian. He was a soccer goalkeeper, gold medalist at the 1956 games in Melbourne. Well, technically a gold medalist.\n\nAt the time, the best goalkeeper in the world was Lev Yashin, who, unfortunately for Razinsky, also played for the Soviet Union. So, in international matches, Razinsky was relegated to backup. And a backup he stayed, until the quarterfinals, when the Soviets needed him to step in. Razinsky shutout Indonesia, Yashin returned for the semis and final, and the Soviets took gold.\n\nWell, some Soviets took gold. At the time, medals were only awarded to players who took part in the final. So even though he played during the tournament, Razinsky was snubbed.\n\nSo we were going to make a big deal out of this, but it turns out that Razinsky did get his medal, be it 50 years later.\n\nInstead, let's make a big deal that Razinsky is that rare Jewish soccer Olympic champion!",
