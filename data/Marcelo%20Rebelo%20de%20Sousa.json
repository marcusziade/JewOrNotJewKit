  "description": "\"Who in Portugal can be absolutely sure of not having in their genealogy a secret rib of that descent?\"\n\nThose are the words of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the current Portuguese  president. \"That descent\"? Well, Jewish, of course! Portugal had a long Jewish tradition... Emphasis on \"had\". It's been half a millennium, give or take.\n\nOne part of the statement concerns us, however... the \"secret rib\". \"Secret\" we get, goys don't want other goys to know about their Jewish origins. But \"rib\"? Is that some kind of a Portuguese idiom? (In the original quote it's \"costela secreta\", and \"costela\" is, well, \"rib\", with no other translations given. \"Costela de porco\", for example, is the very unkosher \"pork rib\".) Of all the bones, why pick rib? (Does it have to do with Adam and Eve?) Why even pick a bone? It's a weird, weird quote. Let's just assume it's lost in translation and move on.\n\nOh, and Rebelo de Sousa claims that he has \"Jewish blood\" on his mother's side. \"Sangue judaico\", if you are wondering.",
