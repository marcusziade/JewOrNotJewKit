  "description": "Dear Jews,\n\nI'm writing to you to complaint. It's about that terrible little show on Amazon, the \"Marvelous Mrs Maysel\". I say little, but that pile of garbage actually just won a bunch of Emmies! Can you believe it?\n\nThe show, as you Jews must know, is about a Jewess comedianne, Mrs Maysel. The show has a lot of Jew stereotypes, including: Mrs Maysel, her husband and her parents.\n\nHere is a problem, Jews: Mrs Maysel is not played by a Jewess! That is right, Rachel Brosnahan is NOT one of you? Can you believe it? The goys have taken a juicy Jew role and have taken it over!!! Talk about cultural misapropriation. If I was a Jew, I would be up in arms about it.\n\nThis is an absolute outrage. I hearby demand that the show should be canceled and that \"Rachel\" Brosnahan (probably not her real name) is replaced by a real Jewess actress!\n\nAnd no, I actually have never watched a minute of the show.",
