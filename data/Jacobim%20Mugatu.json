  "description": "We've profiled quite a few fashion designers, from Ralph Lauren to Marc Ecko, but Jacobim Mugatu stands alone. After all, how many fashion designers have tried to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia? The list begins and ends with Mugatu.\n\n\nThat being said, Mugatu does share one key aspect with Lauren, Ecko, and countless others at the top of the fashion world: he changed his name. Lauren did not want to be a Lifshitz, Ecko did not want to be a Milecofsky. Mugatu did not want to be a Moogberg.\n\nYes, that is a rare photo of an album released by Mugatu, or, as revealed, Jacob Moogberg, at a younger age. This, of course, poses all kinds of questions, most important of them being: did Mugatu conceal his Jewishness?\n\nSome would jump to conclusions and readily assume so, but we will not be so negligent. \"Moogberg\" does not appear on lists of any Jewish names. Yes, \"Moog\" by itself can be a surname, but it is strictly goyishe German, not Jewish. The suffix \"berg\" can obviously be German as well. So it seems pretty clear Mugatu is not a Jew.\n\nInstead...\n\nfunction showPic() { showDiv(null, 'berg'); }\nde = false;\nfunction flip() {\n  de = !de;\n  if (de) {\n    memorize();\n    ratTitle.innerHTML = 'German Score:';\n    setRatings(4, 1, 4);\n    ratPic1.src = 'img/people/b/boris_becker.jpg';\n    ratPic2.src = 'img/other/arnold.jpg';\n    ratPic3.src = 'img/people/b/boris_becker.jpg';\n   setVerdict('German');\n  } else {\n    remember();\n    ratTitle.innerHTML = 'Jew Score:';\n\n  }\n}",
