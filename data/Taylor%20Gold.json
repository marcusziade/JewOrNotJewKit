  "description": "It seems that every time we watch the Olympics, we have no choice to complain about NBC. Today's is Winter Edition: 2022.\n\nThe fact that NBC's coverage is American-centric is understandable. After all, it is watched by Americans, and Americans could care less about some Lithuanian or Uzbekistani. But even among Americans, there are levels of importance.\n\nTake snowboarding, for one. If you've been watching men's halfpipe, the one name you hear is Shaun White. And for good reason â€” White is a three-time gold medalist who has redefined the sport. But watching NBC, you would think that White is the only person competing! Well, he (obviously) isn't, and he is not even the only American!\n\nWhat about Taylor Gold? What about his story? He competed in 2014 and fell when trying to squeeze out the last trick! He missed out 2018 due to injury! He has a great last name! His sister Arielle is a bronze medalist in women's halfpipe! He is Jewish! (Well, NBC might not want to publicize that.)\n\nInstead, all we get after hearing how wonderful Shaun White is, NBC adds at the very end: \"Two other Americans qualified for the final, Taylor Gold and Chase Josey.\"\n\nYeah, we have no idea who Chase Josey is either.",
