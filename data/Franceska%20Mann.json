  "description": "Today, we will tell you the story of one of the most renowned ballerinas of all of Poland. In the 1930s, the graceful Franceska Mann shined on stage, delighting theater goers throughout the land. Since we're talking about prewar Poland here, you know what happened next...\n\nMann had the unfortunate circumstance of being a Jew. So, when the Nazis came, she was first interned in the Warsaw Ghetto, then transferred to Auschwitz. There, she was taken to the gas chambers and told to undress. You know what happened next...\n\nIt's unlikely you know what happened next: Mann grabbed her captor's gun and shot him to death. The other women took notice and started a revolt that led to other Nazis being killed. You know what happened next...\n\nThere is no happy ending here. The rebellion was put down, and all the women, including Mann, were executed. The Nazis tried to destroy the records, but still, the few surivors of Auschwitz carried it on...\n\nThe story of one of the most renowned ballerinas in all of Poland.",
