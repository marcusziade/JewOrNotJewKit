  "description": "It starts with an email in our suggestion box. \"Please profile Jennifer Lawrence,\" it says. We think about it for a minute and pass. We just don't know what to say. Yes, she is rather attractive. Yes, she is a wonderful actress. But no, she is not even remotely Jewish. There is no hook here.\n\nAnother email comes; another request for Jennifer Lawrence. Maybe we missed something, we ask ourselves. So we do a cursory search. Well, her mother's maiden name is Koch. That could be something, couldn't it?\n\nThe suggestion box gets filled again. Again, it's Jennifer Lawrence. We look some more. No, these Koches aren't Jewish. They are Kentuckians, after all. Sorry, suggesters.\n\nMore emails... More suggestions. They come feverishly now, around the clock: Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence! She wins the Oscar, she falls down, she laughs it off... Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence!\n\nFine! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine! You win, suggestion box. We give up.\n\nShe is rather attractive.\n\nShe is a wonderful actress.\n\nShe is not Jewish.\n\nShe is Jennifer Lawrence.",
