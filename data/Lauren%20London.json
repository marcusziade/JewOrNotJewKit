  "description": "Every now and then, something Jewy appears on TV, and our readers let us know. Apparently, they want our opinion on it. And we oblige, and not because some of us have nothing better to do all day than to watch TV. Well, that too.\n\nBut, for the life of us, we can't press play on \"You People\", a movie that came out last year on Netflix. Here's a one-line review from a respected website: \"A movie that so rarely rings true it starts to make your skin crawl.\" Pass.\n\nThis despite a rather stellar cast: Julia Louis-Dreyfus! Eddie Murphy! David Duchovny! Rhea Perlman! Elliott Gould! With Jonah Hill and Lauren London as star-crossed lovers. He is Jewish, she is Muslim. Get it? \"You People\"? Pass.\n\nNow, this is not MuslimOrNotMuslim.com (oh, so far from it!), but we wonder if Muslim viewers care that neither Murphy nor Nia Long, who plays his wife, are Muslim at all. They are both Catholic. And London? Well, she is Christian, but her father is Jewish...\n\nAnother review: \"A perfect movie for Netflix because it's best watched for the first half hour and then turned off, which Netflix will count as a view anyway.\"\n\nHard pass.",
