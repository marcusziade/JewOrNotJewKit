  "description": "Why is everybody watching \"Suits\"?\n\nWe turn on Netflix, and there it is, \"Suits\". We don't want to watch \"Suits!\" But we're in the minority?\n\nApparently, it's breaking all kinds of records on Netflix. \"Suits\"? Didn't it run on the USA Network, of all places? Wasn't it that show with Zach Morris as a lawyer? No, that was \"Franklin \u0026 Bash\". What the hell is \"Suits\"?\n\nOh. It's the show with Meghan Markle. Sure, she is kinda famous now. Gabriel Macht had a main role, and his name does ring a bell... That's right, he was The Spirit in that rather regrettable movie in 2008. Hasn't done much otherwise, other than, you know, \"Suits\".\n\nI think we have the answer. People are watching \"Suits\" because they are turning on Netflix and it's telling them to watch \"Suits\". What was that George Costanza quote? \"Why am I watching it? â€” Because it's on TV!\"\n\nStill, \"Suits\"?",
