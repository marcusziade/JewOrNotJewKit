  "description": "Sadly, the name of Bernard Werber is little-known to the English speaker. For some reason, one of the best-selling European novelists is largely not translated into English; neither in England nor in the United States.\n\nMaybe because he's French. For face it, for hundreds of years the English have hated the French, and for dozens of years, the Americans have done so as well. And it's sad, really, since among the beret-wearing mime-watching frog-eating America-hating snobs, you find someone like Werber, an intelligent, creative, imaginative, thoughtful, incredible author.\n\nOh, and he is Jewish. So, faithful reader, learn French. Or German, or Russian, or any other language that Werber has been translated to. Read \"The Empire of Angels\". Read \"We the Gods\". And admit that not all French people are bad.\n\nEspecially if they are Jewish.",
