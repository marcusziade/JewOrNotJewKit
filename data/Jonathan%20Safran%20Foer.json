  "description": "Jonathan Safran Foer was born in 1977, making him about the same age as the creators of this very website.\n\nJonathan Safran Foer wrote \"Everything Is Illuminated\", a novel about the search for his Jewish past. (Oh, if it was only so simple. It's a brilliant overlay of modern clash of cultures and life in a shtetl, depicted through the lens of magical realism.) We adore it.\n\nThe creators of this website wrote... this website, together with some dubious attempts at novels of various quality, some finished, some not.\n\n\"Everything Is Illuminated\" was called \"a work of genius\" by The Times. Foer received praise from John Updike, Salman Rushdie, Joyce Carol Oates, and many others.\n\nThe creators of this website subsist on whatever positive comments our faithful readers send in. Thank you, dear readers! There might not be an Updike or a Rushdie among you, but we love you anyway.\n\nSigh.\n\nWell, it's all right. The night is young.",
