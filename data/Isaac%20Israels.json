  "description": "Did you know that from 1912 to 1952, the Olympics were not just about sport, but also about art? About sport. Art about sport. Got it?\n\nDuring those Games, competitors were judged in five areas: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The only requirement is that the submitted art referenced sport. Participation was sporadic; so was the awarding of medals. Some events decided to skip the gold or the silver; some didn't award medals altogether. Stop us when this starts making sense.\n\nAlright, let's get to the Jews. Other than the previously profiled Alfred Hajos, the one definite Jew who medalled in art was impressionist Isaac Israels. Son of famed Dutch painter Jozef Israels, Isaac was quite accomplished in his own right. He took the gold in the 1924 for a painting named \"Cavalier Rouge\".\n\nSo why did it all end? Did the absurdity of awarding medals for art finally catch up to the organizers?\n\nNot exactly. You see, the Olympics were supposed to be for amateurs only, and art competitions were entered by professionals. So they were ended in the name of amateurism.\n\nMaking sense yet?",
