An Israeli, so he probably is, right? But we decided to wait for the NBA Draft to profile him. (What if he went to the incompetent New York Knicks? So much potential humor can be had at their expense!)\n\nThe draft didn't come, of course. When COVID hit, the NBA season was postponed, and the draft with it.
