  "description": "Even though each is very different, Michael Cera's many roles in movies and television have shared certain characteristics:\n Unathletic\n Socially uncomfortable\n Sexually inexperienced (yes, even in Juno)\n Earnest\n Good-hearted\n Intelligent\n\nLooking at that list, many people have reached a fairly logical conclusion:\n\nMichael is Canadian! And they're right â€” he is. Following in the great Canadian comedic tradition of John Candy, Leslie Nielsen, Rick Moranis, Dan Aykroyd, Mike Myers, Seth Rogen and scores of others.\n\nWhat? You think all of this makes him Jewish? See, now that's just silly.",
