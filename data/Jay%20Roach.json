  "description": "We were pretty sure that Jay Roach was Jewish. It's unclear why.\n\nPerhaps it was because he directed the Austin Powers movies? Jews are sure great at making spoofs. Or maybe because he went on to helm \"Meet the Parents\"? Not exactly highbrow material, but can't deny the Jewish quotient.\n\nFrom that on, Roach somehow became the go-to-guy for ripped-from-the-headlines political dramas: \"Recount\" (2000 election), \"Game Change\" (2008 election), and the more historical \"All the Way\" (Bryant Cranston as LBJ). Today, he is behind the much-talked-about \"Bombshell\" (sexual harassment at Fox News). So, left-leaning political spiel: Jew?\n\nTurns out that we were right. Even though Roach was raised Baptist, he converted to Judaism for his marriage to previously-profile musician Susanna Hoffs.\n\nOh, Roach also directed \"Dinner for Schmucks\". Schmucks! Maybe that should have been our first hint...",
