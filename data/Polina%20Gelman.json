  "description": "Have we ever profiled a Jewish witch? The Scarlet Witch doesn't count, she is fictional. Leona Hemsley? Sure, we'll give you that one...\n\nAnyway: a Jewish witch!\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviets had an elite flight squadron, the 46th guard bombing regiment. They had a special tactic: while flying over Nazi targets at night, they would turn off their engines, silently glided over, and... BOMBS AWAY! The Germans, versed on tales of various Broomhildas, likened their muffled sound to broomsticks, hence: the Night Witches. Did we mention they were all women?\n\nIt wasn't just the pilots. The regiment was entirely female: navigators, mechanics, technicians; the majority was in their early 20s. Among those women was pilot Polina Gelman. With 860 flights and 164 bombings to her name, she was one of the most prolific Night Witches.\n\nSo, a Jewish witch! Much cooler than Leona Hemsley, no?",
