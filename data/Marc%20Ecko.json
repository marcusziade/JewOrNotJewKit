  "description": "Earlier this spring, we were driving through Newark, New Jersey. It was the first sunny day after a torrential downpour, so many local residents took to the streets to take in the warmth.\n\nNow, those unfamiliar with Newark might need an explanation. The once-Jewish city is now a budding metropolis full of many minorities. It's residents are mostly black or Hispanic, and there is a sizable Portuguese/Brazilian community.\n\nSo here we are, driving through Newark, and we can't help but notice the one word appearing on so many articles of clothing of these fashionable young people. \"ECKO\". As in Marc Ecko, the fashion designer with an ultra-hip fashion line.\n\nNow, we are not hip. And fashion is not exactly a priority. And we wouldn't know Marc Ecko from a hole in a wall, if not for a fact that we know he's a Jew, and that his real last name is Milecofsky.\n\nCan you picture it? \"MILECOFSKY\". Slapped on a t-shirt in a funky font, proudly worn by a trendy teenager?\n\nNo. No, you can't.",
