Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I want to be a Formula 1 racer, but my parents say it's too dangerous! Can you tell them they are crazy? â€” Kyle Rabinowicz, 12, Boulder, Colorado\n\nDear Kyle,\n\nYour parents might have a point. You know who was probably the most famous Jewish Formula 1 driver? Peter Revson. He was an heir to a cosmetic fortune... and died in a crash. And then there was Francois Cevert, an heir to a jewelry fortune... who died in a crash. Currently, Formula 1 has only one Jewish driver, Lance Stroll, who hasn't died... yet, but is an heir to a fashion fortune.\n\nIn summary, yes, it's pretty dangerous, but even if you don't end up dying... you better be an heir to a some kind of a fortune to give it a whirl. Maybe you should consider NASCAR?\n\nListen to your parents,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
