  "description": "We were combing through Nobel laureates, looking for another interesting scientific Jew to profile, when something hit us:\n\nOnly one woman has won the Nobel in Economics.\n\nThey started giving out that prize in 1969, and so far it has gone to 76 individuals. Only one of those was a woman. Talk about disappointingly misogynistic.\n\nNow, that woman, Elinor Ostrom, was Jewish, so that's nice and everything. But let's not harp on that fact to belittle the situation. We're not expecting the number to be 50%, but one out of 76? Of all the backroom shenanigans and cronyism that plague the Nobels, how come so little attention is brought to this disparity?\n\nIt's even worse in Physics, where just two out of 200 winners were women, and the last one of those was in 1963. And none of them were Jewish...\n\nSee, that's just messed up.\n\n(Editor's update, 2019: There are now two female Economics laureates, with Esther Duflo joining Ostrom.)\n\n(Editor's update, 2023: Now three. Should we stop counting?)",
