  "description": "Sometimes we just can't help ourselves.\n\nAfter all, we have pages and pages of evidence to the contrary. Profile after profile of prominent, talented, athletic Jews. Why just this week alone we'll see championship swimmer Jews, pole vaulter Jews, and tennis prodigy Jews.\n\nSo why can't we get the traditional image of the American Jew out of our silly kosher kepeles? Because in our hearts, we just feel that Jews win at chess, not cross country. We get medals for calculus, not rowing.\n\nSo that's why we're happy to embrace Australian Jew David Zalcberg. An Olympic ping pong player? Now that we can understand.",
