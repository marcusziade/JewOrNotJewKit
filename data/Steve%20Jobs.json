  "description": "Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder and CEO, is not Jewish. He doesn't practice Judaism. He doesn't self-identify as Jewish. His parents are not Jewish. End of story.\n\nOr is it?\n\nFor Paul and Clara Jobs are not Steve's biological parents; his birth parents are Abdulfattah John Jandali (obviously not a Jew) and Joanne Carole Schieble, who just happens to be...\n\nNo, not Jewish either. German/Swiss Catholic. Jandali, a Syrian Muslim, and Schieble gave up Steve for adoption when he was born out of wedlock, but later married â€” in a church, and became the parents of Mona Jindali, later known as novelist Mona Simpson (after who, interestingly, Homer Simpson's mother is named)... Where were we?\n\nYes, Steve Jobs. Not Jewish.\n\nEnd of story.",
