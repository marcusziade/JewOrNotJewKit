  "description": "Sharon Stone says that \"she feels so neurotic that she knows what it must feel like to be Jewish\". Sorry, Sharon, but we're gonna have to call shenanigans on this one. (Is there a Yiddish word for shenanigans? It seems like there must be one.)\n\nYou might support Israel and various Jewish causes, but we're gonna need a little more than that. And you definitely had your chances to raise it up a notch and embrace your supposed neuroses with a conversion. For example, when you married Michael Greenburg, a Jew. Or when you married Phil Bronstein, a Jew. Those seemed like perfect opportunities. Yet here you are, still on the other side of the fence, with no real intention to climb over.\n\nSo sorry, Sharon. Until you really do something about it, you're still a shiksa. How is that for a Yiddish word?",
