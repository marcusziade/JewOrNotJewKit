  "description": "We thought we were done with this.\n\nThe Winter Olympics came and went. We profiled a bunch of athletes, a few of them Jewish. We learned more about figure skating than we ever wanted. And that was going to be it, for another four years.\n\nApparently not.\n\nFor there are multiple questions about the breakthrough athlete of these Games, Russian 15-year-old figure skater Yulia Lipnitskaya. Not only is that surname possibly Jewish, but her choice of music, \"Schindler's List\", is ringing the alarm for many people.\n\nAlas, it looks like the alarms have to be quieted. Yulia chose the music because it moved her, not because of Jewish linkage. In fact, other skaters have performed to \"Schindler's List\" before, including the particularly goyishe Katarina Witt. Yes, Yulia's surname could be Jewish, but not necessarily. And, if that cross around her neck was not evidence enough, her choreographer flat out stated that Yulia is not Jewish.\n\nOf course, considering that Yulia skates for Russia, and all the antisemitic overtones that still exist in that country, is it possible that her Jewish heritage is kept on the down low?\n\nWe'll let you know when we're done with this.",
