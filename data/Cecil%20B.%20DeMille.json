  "description": "Every Easter Sunday, American television shows \"The Ten Commandments\", Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical epic starring Charlton Heston (Not a Jew, stop asking) as Moses. Why they keep showing a Jewish story on a Christian holiday is a mystery to us.\n\nMuch like the characters in Cecil's movie, his mother, Beatrice, experienced a religious exodus of her own. You see, she came to England from America, where she met a playwright named Henry de Mille. Beatrice fell in love... but her Jewish family wanted none of it. So she escaped Judaism and became an Episcopalian.\n\nAs for Cecil, he admitted that he didn't like \"the Jewish people\", so we can't revel too much in his partial Jewishness. However, he didn't find out about his roots until late in his life. We're not sure if that had any bearing on his film.\n\nSeriously, shouldn't Easter be the time for movies about Jesus' supposed resurrection? \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", perhaps? That's a good one...",
