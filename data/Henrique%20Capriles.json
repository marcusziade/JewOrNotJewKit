  "description": "Back in 2013, we made a couple of jokes at the expense of the Venezuelan election. Nicolas Maduro was facing off Henrique Capriles. Both had Jewish heritage. Maduro had a funny mustache. Ha-ha.\n\nNo one in Venezuela is laughing now.\n\nMaduro's reign turned the once-prospering country into the land of horror. While he is not the only one to blame (his predecessor and patron Hugo Chavez can't be forgotten), Venezuela has descended into chaos. People are starving. People are rioting. People are being killed on the street. Meanwhile, Maduro is changing the constitution and has become de facto dictator. That mustache is not so funny anymore.\n\nCapriles is at the center of the opposition, trying to rescue his country from the abyss. Their presidential election is coming up next year, so this would give him a chance to unseat the usurper... except that Maduro's government has barred Capriles from running for office for 15 years.\n\nBe careful who you elect, Venezuela! It's no joke! (Come to think of it... not just Venezuela. Sigh.)",
