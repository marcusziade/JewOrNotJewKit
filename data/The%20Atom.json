  "description": "For a medium written mostly by Jews, hippies, and agnostics, there sure are a lot of Christmas-themed comics.\n\nIt's not like the medium really lends itself to a rollicking Santa story, either. Hey Wolverine! Santa needs these cookies cut up and pronto! No problem, bub! Snikt! *Cringe*.\n\nIs there a positive to this treacly tradition? Well, ordinarily when media forces some egg nog down our throats, they compensate by outing some random, previously unaffiliated, preferably super-ancilary, character as Jewish. So do comics at least give us that, bitter, consolation? Not so much.\n\nThey had the Atom visit a Jewish friend once. That's about it. \n\nThe Mighty Mite has been stuffed in bowling balls and lightbulbs, forced to live amongst a race of tiny Amazonian people, transformed into a teenager and been retconned into oblivion. But even the comics know that Ray Palmer, Jew, is simply too ridiculous to accept.",
