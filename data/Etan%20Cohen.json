  "description": "You gotta feel for Etan Cohen. Every single review of his newest film makes sure to point out that he is NOT Ethan Coen.\n\nEthan Coen, of course, is one half of the Coen Brothers, the brilliant writer/director team responsible for such gems as \"Fargo\", \"The Big Lebowski\", and \"No Country for Old Men\". Transpose the h, you get director Etan Cohen, responsible for such duds as \"Get Hard\" and \"Holmes and Watson\". Well, calling that last one as a dud is doing him a favor: it was abhorred by pretty much every critic, at one point hitting the dreaded zero on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBut here is the thing... we actually liked \"Holmes and Watson\". Yes, really! Maybe its our heightened tolerance of Will Ferrell, or our general love of anything and everything that has to do with the consulting detective, but we did enjoy the film! Oh, it's crass, and boorish, and completely illogical (Conan Doyle must be spinning in his grave), and many jokes fail miserably, but that doesn't mean we didn't laugh. And we laughed a lot.\n\nNot all movies can be masterpieces, right? And not all movie makers can be Ethan Coen...",
