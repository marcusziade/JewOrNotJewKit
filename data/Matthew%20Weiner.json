  "description": "What is the most Jewish show on TV? Would you believe it's \"Mad Men\"?\n\nNow, here we have a problem. You see, we loathe to reveal spoilers, especially since one of us is lagging quite back on the show. Also, many of these things are revealed rather subtly. So what we're going to do is hide potential spoilers in parentheses, and you can highlight the text to see them. Clever, aren't we?\n\nSeason 1: Don has (affair) with (Rachel Menken), Jew.\n\nSeason 2: The firm hires (Jane Siegel), Jew, who (marries) Roger in season 3.\n\nSeason 4: Don has (affair) with (Faye Miller), Jew. The firm hires (Danny Siegel), Jew. Peggy (dates) (Abe Drexler), Jew.\n\nSeason 5: The firm hires (Michael Ginsberg), Jew.\n\nAlright, so there are not exactly any MAJOR Jewish characters. Perhaps \"Mad Men\" is the most subtly Jewish show on TV? Creator Matthew Weiner wouldn't have it any other way, right?\n\n.white {color:#FFFFFF;}",
