  "description": "If you are an American high school student, you live in the constant fear of three little letters: S. A. T. The Scholastic Aptitude Test not only determines your college future, it pretty much determines your life. (NOT a hyperbole!)\n\nThe SAT has often been accused of being culturally biased, to which we emphatically say: YES! And we're not talking about the race, gender and income accusations of today (that's a topic for another forum). We're talking about SAT's roots that stem in... antisemitism.\n\nThe SAT was started to keep Jews out of Ivy League universities; it was specifically designed for Jews to get lower grades. (How did they do that, with questions about crucifixes and trefe? Christianity : Truth :: Judaism : a) Chicanery b) Deceit c) Duplicity d) Treachery (All answers are correct!!!))\n\nIt initially worked, but enter Stanley Kaplan. He had a solution: create an SAT tutoring service for New York's Jews. We're not sure exactly how it worked against the bias, but did it ever work! It was so successful that it soon spread, becoming the #1 SAT tutorial in the nation, the status it still holds today. Heck, even goyim use it!\n\nAs for our own SAT scores, maybe we should have used Kaplan...",
