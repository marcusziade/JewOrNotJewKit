  "description": "We've been a little confused by Arlen Specter lately.\n\nReal quick for those of you who have been living under a rock the past 20 years (aka, the entire voting-eligible American public), Specter is a Republican senator for Pennsylvania. As previously mentioned we try not to take sides in these things, but suffice to say we're not completely appalled by him. He splits the bill on the major negative stereotypes (anti-foreigner, no. Bloodthirsty, yes). He's even been referred to as a \"RINO\" or \"Republican in Name Only\" which, while meant to be pejorative, sounds fairly complimentary to us. Like saying someone's bad at being a murderer. Whoops, so much for objectivity.\n\nOh, and (duh) he's a Jew. So that's all good.\n\nAnyway, we were perfectly happy to ignore him until this whole NFL thing showed up. Suddenly he has this mad on for the New England Patriots A/V department and their oh so tricksy (and no different than any other team in professional sports) policy of doing everything they can to win. \n\nNow he's on ESPN more than Brett Favre, thumping podiums and calling for anti-trust lawsuits like any of us give a damn. And we have to wonder. Why? Why does Senator Specter suddenly care? \n\nAnd then it hit us: he's trying to get himself mentioned in our quest for prominent, respectable Jewish politicians!\n\nWell sorry to crack your matzoh Arlen. \n\nClose, but no gelt.\n\n(Editor's update: a RINO no more, Specter became a Democrat late in his term.)",
