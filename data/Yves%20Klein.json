  "description": ".ykb { color:#002FA7; }\n\n\nYves Klein invented a color.\n\nWhat, you think that's easy? You try to do it! Think of a color that no one has thought of before. No, that's viridian. No, that's carnelian. No, that's gamboge. (Gamboge! It's a real color!)\n\nKlein didn't just think of a color. He actually invented it, mixing it in his Paris studio. Klein used a synthetic alternative to the ultramarine pigment, coming up with a shade of blue never seen before. The shade we're using to write this profile.\n\nThe name of that color? IKB, or International Klein Blue. (The other obvious question: no, Klein wasn't Jewish. Just incorrectly reported to be so.)\n\nKlein loved the color so much that he started to use it everywhere, from simple IKB canvases to performance art of naked models painted in IKB. We'd love to show you an example, but this is a family website.\n\nKlein died from a heart attack at the age of 34. You know, this ending is leaving us...\n\nBlue.",
