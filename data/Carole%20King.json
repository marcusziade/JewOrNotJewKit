  "description": "The purpose of this profile (profiles!) is to stop ourselves from confusing Carole King and Carol Kane.\n\n(We know this is not the first time we got confused with similarly-named celebrities. See the Helen Hunt (Holly Hunter) and Tony Roberts (Tony Robbins) profiles. Such is our lot...)\n\nCarole King: composer, singer, songwriter. Won a bunch of Grammys. Member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"Her music would become the soundtrack to a generation. She wrote the songs that made other people famous.\" That's according to the ad for her Broadway musical. Yes, there is a Broadway musical, \"Beautiful\", based on her life. That's Carole King.\n\nCarol Kane: actress, comedienne. Won a bunch of Emmys. Oscar nominee. Played Woody's non-Annie Hall girlfriend in \"Annie Hall\". Was Andy Kaufman's girlfriend on \"Taxi\". \"I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!\" That's from \"Princess Bride\", where she steals a very memorable scene as Miracle Max's wife. Also acted on Broadway in \"Wicked\". That's Carol Kane.\n\nJewish? Both are Jewish.\n\nOne final thing: Carol Kane's real name is Carolyn. Carole King's is... Carol. Talk about confusing!",
