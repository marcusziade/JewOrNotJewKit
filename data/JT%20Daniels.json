  "description": "We've long given up hope of Josh Rosen becoming the great Jewish quarterbacking messiah (document.write(String.fromCharCode(169)) JONJ, 2015). It's just not happening.\n\nSo who needs Rosen, when there is JT Daniels, Halachically Jewish! In 2018, he was the #1-ranked high school player in all of America, then started as a freshman at USC!\n\nAlas, it didn't work out at USC, so in 2020 Daniels transferred to Georgia, where he played for the eventual 2021 national champions!\n\nAlas, it didn't work out at Georgia, as Daniels was benched during that championship season, so in 2022 he transferred to the less heralded West Virginia.\n\nAlas, it didn't work out at West Virginia, so Daniels is transferring again, this time to Rice. This will probably make him the oldest college quarterback in 2023... and unlikely to become the great Jewish quarterbacking messiah (document.write(String.fromCharCode(169)) JONJ, 2015).\n\nIt's just not happening.",
