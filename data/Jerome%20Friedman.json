  "description": "\"Physics is somethin' interesting, and it ain't just somethin' done by stiff geezers who is pricks.\" â€” Ali G\n\nWe couldn't have said it better, Ali. So when an email drops in our suggestion box asking us to profile Nobel laureate Jerome Isaac Friedman, who discovered deep inelastic scattering, we oblige.\n\nOf course, we have no idea what deep inelastic scattering is. So, quoting Wikipedia (what else!):\nDeep inelastic scattering is a process used to probe the insides of hadrons (particularly the baryons, such as protons and neutrons), using electrons, muons and neutrinos.\n\nBaryons? Muouns? Interesting or not, that went straight over our head. So let's go back to the opening quote, said by Sacha Baron Cohen, in the guise of Ali G, to... Jerome Isaac Friedman, who is definitely not a stiff geezer! \"He aint, he is a good bloke!\", concluded Ali. \"That's very kind of you,\" Friedman replied.\n\nBooyakasha!",
