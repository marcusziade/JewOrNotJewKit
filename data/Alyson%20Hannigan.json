  "description": "\"My one biggest priority of the show is that Aly becomes a sex symbol, and now she has — so I'm very happy about that.\" — Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator (and nerd deity) Joss Whedon\n\nEver take a really good look at a so-called supermodel? Actually really not all that attractive. Beyond the fact that they all look like they could use a good meal, no one in real life looks like that — the nosebleed-high cheekbones, the bunny slope noses, the angular bodies... \n\nAre these even human beings? There's an otherworldly quality to those we have anointed as the truly \"beautiful\" and it's more off-putting than arousing.\n\nWe'll take the human beings, thank you very much. Forget the girl-who's-out-of-this-world, give us the girl-next-door. So Ms. Hannigan? Right up our Aly (maybe not in that pic, but most other times, anyway). That her perfect-5-O-score name on LeprechaunOrNotLeprechaun.com belies a half-Jewish upbringing? All the better.\n\nHave we made the right choice? Let's see... Willow or career-MIA SMG? The girl from band camp or the girl from surgery, Tara Reid? The bubbly wife from How I Met Your Mother or the one bad part of the Avengers movie?\n\nYeah, we thought so. Cute chicks, FTW. \n\nNot that we'd turn down advances from supermodels. Y'know, ummm, if any were, y'know... interested. Or anything.",
