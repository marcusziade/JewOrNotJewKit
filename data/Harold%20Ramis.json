  "description": "Back in the 1970s and 80s, if you were in the mood for a great, slightly edgy, fun-filled, comedy then you need only look for one name: Harold Ramis.\n\nYou could do little wrong by planning a weekend's entertainment based on his IMDB, bottom to top: Animal House (wrote), Meatballs (wrote), Caddyshack (wrote and directed), Stripes (wrote and starred), Vacation (directed), Ghostbusters (wrote and starred).\n\nThat's a heck of a weekend! A little Bill Murray heavy, we grant, but still!\n\nThat streak stopped after 1993 and Groundhog Day. We wish we could say that Ramis disappeared from movies at that point, never to return. We cannot.\n\nAnd so, nowadays if you're in the mood for a schlocky, waste of time with zero taste and fewer laughs, then you only need look for one name: \n\nAdam Sandler. Oh, and also Harold Ramis.\n\nSad.",
