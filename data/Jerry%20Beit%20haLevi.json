  "description": "We dropped into one of those Internet rabbit holes recently, and emerged with the name of Jewish soccer player Jerry \"The Dwarf\" Beit haLevi. What a fantastical nickname!\n\nTurns out that Jerry earned it because of his stature: 5'3\", or 160 cm. That would make him one of the shortest players in soccer history. (Another Internet rabbit hole found a 5'2\" Argentine, a 5'1\" Pole, and a 5'0\" Brazilian.)\n\nJerry's international career came in the 1930s, when Mandatory Palestine attempted to field a team, and even tried to qualify for the World Cup. They weren't even close to being successful.\n\nAfter Israel's independence, Jerry became a coach of its newly-formed team. He also coached the national team of, of all places, Nigeria, trying to qualify them for the World Cup. They weren't even close to being successful.\n\nFinally: even though he went by Jerry, his real name was... Moshe.\n\nMoshe being called Jerry? Make a tad less sense than \"The Dwarf\"...",
