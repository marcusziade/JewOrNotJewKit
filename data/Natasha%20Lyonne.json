  "description": "We've read rave reviews of \"Russian Doll\", a new Netflix show starring Natasha Lyonne, so we decided to give it a whirl. It didn't hurt that the reviews mentioned how Jewy it is, and we are naturally suckers for that. The plot also seemed interesting, a modern take on \"Groundhog Day\". Death? New York? Jews? Sounds like our cup of tea.\n\nLyonne, who also co-created the show, started as a child actress, had a role in a Woody Allen film, advanced to \"American Pie\", and went through a series of indies before re-emerging. (Making sure to get that child actor card got triple-stamped, she went through alcohol, health, and drug issues.) Just like her character on the new show, Lyonne is Jewish, following the tradition of adopting her middle name (that would be Natasha Bianca Lyonne Braunstein) as an acting pseudonym.\n\nSo what did we think about \"Russian Doll\"?\n\nNot our cup of tea.",
