  "description": "Whenever we struggle for profiles, we open up our mailbox. Today's letter comes from a reader from Connecticut, who asks us to profile Tavi Gevinson. \"She's cool,\" the letter says.\n\nCool, heh? Wouldn't be the first time we wrote about someone just because they're cool... Who can forget our profile of Gilbert Gottfried? Turns out there is more to Tavi than just coolness: she has become very successful at a very young age.\n\nWhen she was 12, Tavi started a fashion blog that received a lot of positive press. By 15, she turned the blog into an online magazine, Rookie, serving as editor-in-chief. According to Wikipedia, the magazine's \"subject matter ranges from pop culture and fashion to adolescent social issues and feminism.\" Tavi is on a bunch of influential teens lists, considered a fashion icon, and, yes, Jewish. (And, since everyone on Internet wants to have an opinion, also a target of a lot of backlash. G-d damn it, Internet! Curb your resentment from time to time, OK?)\n\nSo, that is definitely worth a profile. Especially since we got another request for Tavi, this one from Philadelphia:\n\n\"She is cool and good at fashion stuff.\"\n\nWell, there you have it.",
