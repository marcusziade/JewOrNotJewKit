Even Allen, whose Jew-dar we'd\nnever question, thought Biggs was one when casting him in \"Anything\nElse\".\n\nBut poor Woody was wrong. Jason is not Jewish; he is a Catholic Italian-American.\n\nSo, back to similarities...\n\nBoth have short last names with double consonants... (We might be reaching here.)",
