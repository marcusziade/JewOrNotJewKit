  "description": "If years of watching Jeopardy! have taught us one thing, it's that if you want to be smart, don't be attractive. Seriously, that show will compete with any reality program ever for largest collection of uggos and freaks. But who cares where you can answer, \"what is cabernet sauvignon, Alex\" and look so horrible doing it?\n\nWhat concerns us isn't the looks (ok, the looks are concerning, but we're not talking about that today), but the why? Do pretty people just stop learning at a certain point, buoyed by their beauty? Do smart people simply stop caring about appearance, too busy with calculus or Shakespearean plays or... well, whatever the heck it is that smart, people do?\n\nWe don't know. We're not smart or attractive.\n\nOf course, this discussion just makes us come off as shallow, two-dimensional trolls. Especially when we could be going on and on about the incomparable Emmy Noether instead. \n\nNoether was one of the most accomplished mathematicians and scientists of her day. Notice we didn't say female mathematicians, either. She's one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. Full stop.\n\nBut you didn't know who Emmy Noether was, did you? Of course not. She's not \"pretty.\" Her students were often required to tell her that she had food in her hair. She was never recorded twerking or guest starred on Glee or did any of the other things that would make us know who Emmy Noether was.\n\nNo, all she did was redefine our understanding of the universe.\n\nWhat a shame.",
