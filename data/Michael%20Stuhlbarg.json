  "description": "In the Coen Brothers' oh-so-very-Jewish \"A Serious Man\", Michael Stuhlbarg, Jew, plays college professor Larry Gopnik, whose life unravels before his very own eyes. Seeking answers, he visits a series of rabbis, only to be met... well, we won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it.\n\nLet's just say that the rabbis don't have all the answers. And Larry's life keeps... well, again, no spoilers.\n\nBut isn't that what we LIKE about Judaism? The fact that not everything is so clear-cut and laid out to you on a platter? \"Father O'Mackey, what's hell? — See here, Jimmy, if you're good, you'll go to heaven, with the angels and clouds and harps, and if you're bad, you do to hell, with the devils and fire and brimstone. — But Father O'Mackey, why do bad things happen to good people? — You need to pray harder, Jimmy, and everything will turn out okay.\" Barf.\n\nNo, Judaism forces one to think. Forces one to look for answers outside the dogma. Forces one to expand the mind. And yeah, sometimes things don't work out. And sometimes bad things happen to good people. But that's life.\n\nBut again, no spoilers.",
