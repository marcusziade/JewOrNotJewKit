  "description": "There are websites out there that show poorly translated Chinese tattoos. You know, when someone thinks it would be cool to ink some hieroglyphics, but they don't double-check what the symbols mean. So you get something like \"mad diarrhea\", \"crazy bitch\", or, worse, \"sesame chicken\".\n\nWhat about bad Hebrew tattoos? There are out there too, and we don't mean the case when one accidentally inks \"tasty kugel\". We're talking about when religious goyim decide to use Hebrew to show their love for Jesus.\n\nEven when it's someone lame like Justin Bieber, or someone cool like Stephen Curry, it's just so unnecessary. Not that Hebrew and Jesus don't mix, they kinda do... but it raises all kinds of strange questions. No, Curry is not Jewish. Do you really need us to tell you that?\n\nIf we were to profile every goy with a Hebrew tattoo, we'd turn our website into bad Hebrew tattoo repository... and we don't want that. Unless someone spots \"tasty kugel\". Let us know about that one!",
