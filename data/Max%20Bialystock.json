  "description": "Did you know that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop website than he could with a hit?\n\nJust look at JONJ, for instance. Two years ago, when we started this website, we could go days without writing a profile, and no one would notice. We could make a mistake, and no one would correct us. Our five readers did not put a load on our server. And although we made no money off the site, we certainty did not lose much.\n\nNow... not that we are complaining, but the times have changed. We're stamping out at least five profiles a week, and the suggestion box is overflowing with new requests. Hundreds of daily readers and thousands of database hits forced us to move to a new server. We stay longer hours at work. Weekends are no longer a time to relax. Sleep has been curtailed to an unhealthy seven-and-a-half hours per night. We even had to hire a secretary. JONJ has become a financial, emotional, and mental drain.\n\nHow could this happen? We were so careful. We picked the wrong writing style, the wrong site design, the wrong subject. Where did we go right?",
