  "description": "If you've tuned in to Olympic coverage the past few days, you must have heard it by now.\n\nDara Torres, the All-American mom! In her fifth Olympics, with a plethora of medals behind her! At the age of 41, still as good as ever!\n\nMake that the All-American Jewish mom. That's right, Torres, half-Jewish through her father by birth, made a full conversion after marrying her second husband.\n\nSo while it might be hard to picture one of the most decorated swimmers in Olympic history frying latkes and baking kugel, we're going to do just that. It's easier than picturing OUR OWN mothers competing in the Olympics.",
