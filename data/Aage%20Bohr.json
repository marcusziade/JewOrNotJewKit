  "description": "All the way back in 2008, we profiled Niels Bohr, physicist, Nobel laureate, friend of Einstein. You might have heard of him.\n\nIn 2013, we profiled Harald Bohr, mathematician, soccer Olympian. A little more obscure than brother Niels, but he won a silver medal, so not too shabby.\n\nToday, in 2020, we are profiling Aage Bohr, physicist, Nobel laureate. He is the son of Niels, making them a rarity â€” father and son both winning the Nobel.\n\nAre we done with Bohrs? It seems likely. There is the first famous Bohr, Christian, the father of Niels and Harald, a physiologist, but he was not Jewish at all. There's Aage's brother Ernest, a lawyer and field hockey player who represented Denmark its last-place finish at the 1948 Olympics, but that's neither here nor there. There's Aage's son Thomas, another physicist...\n\nIf Thomas Bohr ever wins that Nobel, he'll get a profile, we guarantee it.",
