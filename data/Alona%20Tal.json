  "description": "For whatever reason, some of us ended up with a lot of time on our hands, so we're binging \"Veronica Mars\"... About 20 years too late, sure.\n\n\"Veronica Mars\" is from the early 2000s that aired on a network that stopped existing during the show's three-year run. It starred the irresistible (and very, very goyishe) Kristen Bell as the titular high school detective and is full of camp and early 2000s nostalgia. (In one episode, the kids read an actual, real, physical newspaper. Made of paper. Those were the days!)\n\nIt also features a bunch of cameos, with everyone from pre-fame Jessica Chastain to post-fame Jonathan Taylor Thomas. There are too many to mention, but we must give props to an episode from Season 2 that features both Steve Guttenberg in what we could only imagine was a failed comeback, as well as Kevin Smith as a clerk in a convenience store. Yes, that Kevin Smith. You go, Veronica Mars!\n\nAmong the memorable faces, there are a bunch of high school kids... well, they are all in their mid-20s, but such is the lot of these shows. Some of the faces we recognize, some not so much. One of those was Veronica's frenemy Meg, an incredibly goyishe WASPy character... who is somehow played by Alona Tal, an Israeli actress.\n\nTal did not exactly do a Jessica Chastain turn after her stint on this show, but what can you do. Besides, we already profiled Chastain, and she is not even Jewish!",
