  "description": "Name a movie, any movie with a hero and a sidekick. Say \"Sherlock Holmes\". Or \"Batman and Robin\" (sorry to invoke memories of \"Batman and Robin\"). The hero is always played by a bigger star than the sidekick. Oh, and he is definitely billed first.\n\nSo what gives with \"The Lone Ranger\"?\n\nYes, the Lone Ranger, a former radio and TV hero now made into a rather unnecessary movie. Starring as the Ranger is Armie Hammer, best known for his portrayal of the Winklevoss twins in \"The Social Network\". He's rather surprisingly part Jewish, related to (and named after) industrialist Armand Hammer (not to be confused with Arm \u0026 Hammer, as we previously discussed).\n\nSo, considering that Hammer as starting as the clear hero in an eponymous movie, does he get first billing? Nope. That goes to the sidekick, Tonto, played by Johnny Depp.\n\nAnd, yeah, we get it, it's Johnny Depp, after all. And heck, no matter who is billed first, it can't be worse than \"Batman and Robin\"...\n\nWe hope.",
