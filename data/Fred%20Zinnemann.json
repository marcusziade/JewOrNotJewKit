  "description": "You, dear reader, probably do not know who Fred Zinnemann was. What if we told you that he was a movie director? Still doesn't ring a bell? You're not alone!\n\nAs the story goes, when a young Hollywood upstart met Zinnemann, he had no idea who he was. So, when asked for Zinnemann's accomplishments, the response was \"you first\".\n\nSo what were Zinnemann's accomplishments? Adept with westerns, thrillers, and musicals, he won four total Oscars: Best Director for \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"A Man for All Seasons\", Best Picture for the latter (he produced), and even Best Short Documentary. He also directed \"Oklahoma!\"... but we won't hold that against him.\n\nInterestingly, the \"you first\" anecdote that has gone down in Hollywood annals is probably apocryphal. According to Zinnemann, it didn't happen to him; it happened to Billy Wilder.\n\nYet, Zinnemann is the one the story got stuck to, so we have no issues of using it as the driving force of this profile. And if you don't like that...\n\nYou first.",
