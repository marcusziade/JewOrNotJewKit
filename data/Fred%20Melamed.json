  "description": "We thoroughly enjoyed WandaVision, Disney+'s bridge between iterations of Marvel storytelling, but one mystery kept bugging us. Without spoiling, it has nothing to do with Wanda, or Vision, or (REDACTED), or (REDACTED), or (Come on! Do we have to? REDACTED).\n\nWhat happened to Arthur Hart?\n\nYou know, Mr. Hart, Vision's very goyishe boss. He was played by the very Jewish character actor Fred Melamed, probably best known for his villainous turn in the Coen Brothers' \"A Serious Man\". (Trivia: Melamed has been in more Woody Allen movies than anyone but Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. We're willing to bet those records stand.) He appears in the pilot episode in a rather large role, and then...\n\nThen he vanishes. Other townspeople, including Mr. Hart's wife, appear time and again, but he is nowhere to be found. What happened? Could Wanda (REDACTED) him? Or maybe it was (REDACTED) who decided that Mr. Hart (REDACTED)? Perhaps he was just (REDACTED)?\n\nThe answer is likely more simple than anything that has to be redacted... Disney probably paid Melamed for only one episode.\n\nAnother WandaVision mystery: why couldn't they stay true to the comic books and make Wanda Jewish?",
