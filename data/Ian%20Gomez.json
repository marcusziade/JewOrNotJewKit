  "description": "A decade ago, a small independent movie came from nowhere and swept through America like a storm. \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\".\n\nIf you somehow missed it (we have no idea how that's possible, since it was required viewing for anyone in a relationship, and has since constantly played on various cable channels), the movie is the story of a rather plain-looking Greek woman who falls for a non-Greek man. A clash of cultures! Forbidden love! Windex! Opa!\n\n\"Wedding\" was written by and starring Nia Vardalos, who based the story on her own. She also tried to marry an outsider. Her family also rejected him. At the end, it all worked out for the best... Just one small difference.\n\nIn the movie, Nia's beloved is played by the rather slender, rather good-looking, rather WASPy John Corbett. In fact, his family is presented as your prototypical, white bread and mayo, bundt cake loving Christians. But in real life, Nia's husband is actor Ian Gomez, who actually had a role in the film... relegated to Corbett's best man (one can imagine the weirdness on the set). Few would describe Gomez as slender or good-looking... and fewer as WASPy. He is half Puerto Rican, half Jewish. Opa!\n\nSo yes, Nia replaced her Jewish husband with a WASPy one. Why? To show a greater contrast? To make the audience identify with the husband? To make bundt cake jokes? (Let's hope it's the former.) Opa!\n\nIn any case, just like his movie counterpart, Gomez did convert to Greek Orthodoxy for the marriage. Opa? Opa...",
