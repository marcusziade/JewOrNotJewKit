  "description": "We find it pretty ironic that with the US economy in the doldrums, this year's Nobel Prize in Economics went to American Paul Krugman.\n\nBut since Paul is Jewish, was recently named one of the foremost global intellectuals, and had nothing to do with the economy's collapse (in fact, foretelling some of the problems), who are we to argue with the all-knowing Nobel Committee?\n\nNow, if the prize went to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, then we'd had a major problem. Even though Bernanke is also a Jew. Who says we can't be fair... sometimes?",
