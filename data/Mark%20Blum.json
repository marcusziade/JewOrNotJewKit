  "description": "It's not often that a film comes along that is both a popular and critical success. A film that seamlessly combines comedy, drama, romance, and action. A film that stands the test of time.\n\nIt's hard to believe that it's been over 25 years since this masterpiece of cinema swept through the world. A little foreign film that broke box office records. A groundbreaking motion picture the likes of which have not been seen before or since.\n\nCrocodile Dundee.\n\nWhat movie did you think we were talking about?\n\nYes, it's been 25 years since Paul Hogan (Not a Jew), starring as the rugged hunter Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee, conquered the hearts of the world. 25 years since a small Australian movie somehow became a bonafide hit. 25 years since we learned what a bidet is for.\n\nEven today, scenes from the film play in our mind. Mick feeding Sue yams in the Australian outback. Mick telling a mugger \"that's not a knife... THAT's a knife\". Mick giving Sue's boyfriend (played by Mark Blum, Jew) a so-deserving fist to the face. Mick checking the gender of bar patrons. And then, in the finale, Mick walking on tops of heads to get to his beloved.\n\nThe Godfather? Casablanca? Citizen Kane? All worthy films.\n\nBut they are not Crocodile Dundee.",
