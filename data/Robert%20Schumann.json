  "description": "Jerry: You know, Schumann went mad from that.\n\nGeorge: Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?\n\n\nIn this memorable exchange from an early episode of Seinfeld, George can't get a song out of his head (a malady that has afflicted us all), so Jerry tells him the story of composer Robert Schumann (or SchuMANN, as George \"recognizes\" him, accent on the second syllable). We'll let Jerry tell it:\n\nHe went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.\n\nAlas, Jerry got it just partly right. Yes, Schumann kept hearing the note. Yes, it was an A. (Pretty amazing Jerry got that right.) But Schumann started going mad long before the note started. It was actually worse than Jerry described: Schumann had demonic visions and attempted to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. He was rescued, and only then institutionalized.\n\nJewish? No.\n\nArite Schuman from Camp Hatchapee? We bet!",
