What kind of a stupid question is that?\n\nOf course, the question wasn't so stupid to the ancient Greeks, and they had an answer ready: the world ended at the strait between Africa and Europe that separated the Middle Sea from the Unknown. No one dared to venture past, not even Hercules, who smashed through a mountain to create the two pillars (one in Europe, one in Africa) that will forever bear his name.\n\nOne small problem: no one knows for sure what the African pillar is supposed to be. There are couple of options, but nothing rivals the stature of the one in Europe, the Rock of Gibraltar. That one has definitely stood the test of time.\n\nGibraltar was won by Britain in the War of the Spanish Succession and has since been a geographic anomaly, a British city at the tip of Spain. Today, some 30,000 call it home.\n\nAnd some of these 30,000 are Jews. None were more prominent than Joshua Hassan, who was twice Chief Minister of Gibraltar, and is considered one of the most influential figures in the rock's modern history.\n\nWhen is the End of the World? Let us get back to you on that one...",
