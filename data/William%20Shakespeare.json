It's all over the interwebs.\n\nSee, if we were making this up, we'd say that Shakespeare was a black Jewish woman.\n\nWhat, that's part of the rumor too?\n\nUmmmm...\n\nShakespeare was a black Jewish Italian Catholic woman?\n\nWhat? That's out there as well?\n\nHow about black Jewish Italian Catholic gay illiterate amputee woman?\n\nOK, that last one we are making up. So how about we stop right now? Why people think all of this is less ridiculous than an unpublished, unemployed actor, we'll never know.",
