  "description": "Whatever happened to the proud tradition of zaftig Jewish actor/comedians?\n\nEven as the previous King of Comedy, Jerry Lewis, has been slipping into senility, we weren't worried. There were three worthy heirs to the throne.\n\nBut what happened? Seth Rogen slimmed down to a point where he is playing superheroes. Jonah Hill looks like half of his former self. And Jeff Garlin?\n\nAs we watched \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" through the years, Garlin's waistline has been shrinking and shrinking. He went from grotesquely overweight to mildly obese to healthy-looking. Which is great for him, don't get us wrong.\n\nBad for our search for talented zaftig Jewish actor/comedians.",
