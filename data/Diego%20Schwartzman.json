  "description": "If you follow pro sports, you must have noticed how all sizes become exaggerated. For example, a six-foot NFL quarterback is considered to be short. And don't get us started on the size of linemen...\n\nAthletes are getting bigger all the time. Even in tennis, where height should not be an issue, has seen its average athlete grow taller and bigger. There is a Croatian player who is six foot eleven! He is not that good...\n\nYou know who is good? Diego Schwartzman, a clay court specialist and an Argentinian Jew. He is currently ranked in the top 15 and has two career ATP titles to his name. His nickname is \"El Peque\", which is short for \"pequeno\", which is... \"short\". Schwartzman is all of five feet, six inches tall.\n\nWow, is that tiny!",
