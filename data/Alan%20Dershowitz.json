  "description": "Dear Jewish parents,\n\nWe have a small request for you. Please stop. Please stop telling your children to become lawyers.\n\nOh, we understand that not everyone will listen to their parents. We understand that odds are, your children will ignore your pleas and become lumberjacks, game show hosts, or — G-d forbid — artists. But some of them will listen. Some of them will become lawyers.\n\nWe understand that lawyers make lots of money. We get it. But there are other jobs that do well. What about doctors, dear parents? That's an all-time Jewish favorite! And doctors HELP people, not suck them dry. We can never have enough doctors.\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, you can just let their children pick their path in life. Oh, it's hard to comprehend, but you don't have to pressure them! Let them be lumberjacks, game show hosts, or — G-d forbid — artists.\n\nHonestly, dear parents, aren't there enough lawyers already?",
