  "description": "Usually, when one is Jewish by birth and states that they are Jewish, the verdict is simple. It's obviously, unequivocally \"Jew\", so we write some gibberish, slap on the verdict, and are done.\n\nThis profile is not so usual.\n\nAaron Lustiger was born Jewish in 1926 in a Parisian suburb. In 1940, he, under his own volition, converted to Catholicism. In 1981, Lustiger was named the Archbishop of Paris. In 1983, a cardinal. Not exactly your usual life for a Jew.\n\nYet he claimed that a Jew he stayed. \"I was born Jewish and so I remain, even if that is unacceptable for many,\" Lustiger wrote. So who are we to argue...\n\nLustiger went on, \"for me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope and I believe that Christianity is the means for achieving it.\"\n\nWe have to applaud him for his use of \"goyim\", but the rest... is not so usual indeed.\n\n\"Borderline Jew\" it is.",
