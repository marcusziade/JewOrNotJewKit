  "description": "There are many, many Jews in this world. Many of them have achieved prominence in various fields. But we can't profile everyone. There's just not enough days in the calendar to write about every important Jew ever. Especially since we profile our share of non-Jews as well.\n\nSo how does one get to be profiled on this website?\n\nWell, being famous always helps. After all, we're running a website here, not an encyclopedia. Having an interesting Jewish (or Not Jewish) background helps. Having a story to tell helps.\n\nAnd, apparently, murdering someone helps as well. In all honesty, we would not have profiled Phil Spector, music producer. Sure, his Jewfro is hilarious, but we've been down that alley before. And sure, he might have worked with the Beatles, and Tina Turner, and the Ramones, but music producers are dime a dozen. Jewish ones especially.\n\nBut Jewish music producers / murderers? We can only think of one.",
