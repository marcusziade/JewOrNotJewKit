  "description": "It used to be that you could tell what each cable channel was by its name. For example, the Discovery Channel showed programs about science and history. Arts \u0026 Entertainment, about... arts and entertainment. The Learning Channel would have educational programming. MTV, Music Television, showed music videos.\n\nNow?\n\nEvery freaking channel is the same.\n\nThey all show reality shows. The only difference is the subject: rednecks, little people, bail bondsmen, trophy wives, pawn shop owners...\n\nMTV is one of the worst offenders, with their round-the-clock coverage of teenage mothers, online daters, and shore trolls. At least the show centering around rapper Mac Miller has some connection to music... but neither that (nor his Jewishness) can redeem anything.\n\nOne might make the case that there was nothing redeemable about MTV in the first place, but that's a different topic...",
