  "description": "Petr Stolypin, Russia's Prime Minister from 1906 to 1911, was a visionary and a reformer. He had a plan to take Russia from the clusterfuck of the 19th century and into the modern age. He is still revered to this day.\n\nStolypin survived not one, not two, not five, but TEN assassination attempts. He wasn't so lucky the 11th time.\n\nWhile attending an opera in Kyiv, together with Czar Nicholas II, Stolypin was gunned down, this time for good. The assassin was Dmitry Bogrov.\n\nBogrov, who switched from the very Jewish Mordekhai to the more goyishe Dmitry, was a double agent. He simultaneously worked for the secret police and the anarchists. At some point, the latter won out, and Bogrov decided to kill the Prime Minister.\n\nSo, who knows what would have happened if Bogrov didn't pick a side and assassination attempts stopped at ten. Perhaps, Stolypin would have had a chance to put forward more reforms, and Russia could avoid the clusterfuck that it became in the 20th century and beyond.\n\nBut not bloody likely.",
