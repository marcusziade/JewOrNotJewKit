  "description": "Welcome to the Jungle, bubbelah?\n\nIt seems too weird to be true: dubiously deemed all-time guitar great Slash is often listed as a member of the tribe. \n\nWell, he's not. His father is gentile, his mother is black, not Jewish as rumored. So we shouldn't expect any performances of \"Sweet Mensch O' Mine,\" \"Nisan Rain\" or \"Live and Let's Go Get A Nosh\" at any upcoming Guns N' Roses reunion concerts. \n\nAnd here we thought it was our chance to expand the list of cool Jewish rock stars that begins and ends with Gene Simmons. Well, that's not happening; the cross Slash is wearing in some of his videos should have been our first hint.\n\nHey, it could be worse. At least he's not pretending to be an English Jew like Madonna.",
