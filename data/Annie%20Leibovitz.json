  "description": "Annie Leibovitz is probably the most famous portrait photographer in the world. She's taken pictures of everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to Yoko Ono to Amy Schumer. Perhaps, her most famous photograph features a severely pregnant figure in a provocative pose:\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nWait, that's clearly not right. Her most famous photograph is this severely pregnant figure in a provocative pose:\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nYou can see how one can get those two confused, right? No? The first one is clearly a parody, isn't it? Well, Leibovitz didn't see it that way.\n\nShe took Paramount, the studio behind \"Naked Gun 33â…“\", all the way to Second Circuit court. There, in a landmark case, the court ruled against her.\n\nHave a sense of humor, Miss Leibovitz. You know who else Naked Gun parodied? Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nYou don't see her taking Frank Drebin to court, do you?",
