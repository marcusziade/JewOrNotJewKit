  "description": "What kind of a name is Breckin Meyer?\n\nWait, who is this Breckin Meyer, anyway?\n\nWasn't he in Clueless? Yeah, pretty sure he was in Clueless?\n\nAnd didn't he headline that show on NBC for a while? No, not Inside Schmidt...\n\nInside Schwartz! That's it, Inside Schwartz! That lasted all of 13 episodes. Geez!\n\nIt's somewhat telling that our recollection of Breckin Meyer is a movie from three decades ago, where he is what, 7th or 8th billed, and a TV show from two decades ago which, again, lasted 13 episodes!\n\nApparently, he was also in the Garfield movies. Both of them. He was NOT the cat...\n\nAnd played a lawyer on some show opposite Zach Morris? Sure, that's something!\n\nSo, back to the original question, what kind of a name is Breckin Meyer?\n\nWell, Meyer is a perfectly cromulent last name, could be Jewish or goyishe, in this case, Jewish, actually...\n\nOh, Breckin! You want to know what kind of a name is Breckin!\n\nWe have no idea.",
