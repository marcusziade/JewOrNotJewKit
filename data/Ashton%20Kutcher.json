  "description": "We can understand Ashton Kutcher... a bit. Who among us hasn't had thoughts about older women?\n\nNow just any older women: gorgeous actresses from our childhood! Demi Moore wouldn't have been our first choice, we would have gone for Sharon Stone. But we can understand the good points of Demi. We get it, Ashton.\n\nBut we also understand that it was never gonna work. Oh, sure, for a while Ashton tried to reach across the age barrier, to have interest in things preferred by his older mate... Plastic surgery, shuffleboard, Kabbalah, adult diapers... But at the end, the age difference hit. It was a question of not if, but when. Frankly, we're surprised they lasted so long.\n\nOf course, since leaving Demi, Ashton hooked up with someone closer to his age group: Mila Kunis.\n\nWe can understand Ashton Kutcher... a bit. Who among us hasn't had thoughts about Mila Kunis?",
