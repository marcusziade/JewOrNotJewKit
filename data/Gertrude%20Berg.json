  "description": "If you need to know who won the most recent Emmy Award for Best Actress, you need to specify: Lead Actress in a Comedy Series? In a Drama Series? In a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie? Or maybe you're talking about the Daytime Emmys? (No one cares about the Daytime Emmys.)\n\nIf you need to know who won the first Emmy Award for Best Actress, you don't need to specify: it was Gertrude Berg. The first two ceremonies didn't even award acting honors all together, so Berg won in 1950, defeating three people we never heard of... and a 28-year-old starlet named Betty White.\n\nBerg was born Tillie Edelstein (We guess \"Gertrude\" was a tad more acceptable to the goyim? \"Berg\" is not exactly an improvement in that area...) and is best known for her role as Molly Goldberg, the matriarch of the original \"The Goldbergs\". She won the Emmy in the 20th year of playing that role, first on the radio, then on television. (Yes, a show about a Jewish family ran for over two decades. Go figure!)\n\nOther winners at those Emmy Awards? Groucho Marx for Most Outstanding Personality and... the Los Angeles Rams for Best Sports Program, which continues to live on in the Sports Emmys. (No one cares about the Sports Emmys.)",
