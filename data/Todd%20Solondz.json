  "description": "You want to know what's a soul-crushing job? Teaching English to Russian emigrants. It's \"the\", not \"ze\", Boris! Stick your tongue between your teeth... BETWEEN your teeth, Boris!\n\nThat was Todd Solondz's job in his 30s. \"I was freed from everything. I had no ambition,\" he says of the time. \"What\", Boris, not \"vat\"! Come on, is it really that difficult?\n\nBut then something happened. Solondz realized that perhaps this was not the future for him. So he turned to movies, creating the critically acclaimed \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\". He has been making independent films since.\n\nWhy has the average movie viewer not heard of Solondz? His movies are not exactly mainstream. They have dealt with rape, pedophilia, suicide, murder, molestation, and abortion, often showing it all in graphic detail. Some of them had to be censored, some had major parts removed to be allowed to be shown to the American audience.\n\nStill, beats teaching English to Russian immigrants, right, Boris? It's \"sheet\", not \"shit\", damn it!",
