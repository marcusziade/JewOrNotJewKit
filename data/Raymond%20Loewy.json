  "description": "The Studebaker was once America's famous automobile brand. For the first half of the 20th century, various Studebakers roamed roads. They even developed an electric car all the way back in 1902! (Yes, you read that right. 1902.)\n\nFor years, Studebaker collaborated with Raymond Loewy, a French-born industrial designer. (Jewish father, but raised Catholic.) Loewy has been called \"the man who shaped America\" and \"the father of industrial design\" for his contributions that ranged from locomotives to numerous logos to Coca-Cola machines to Lucky Strike packages (talk about another brand you haven't heard of in a while).\n\nAs time passed, Studebaker's grip on the market faltered. In the early 1960s, with the company was on its last legs, it commissioned Loewy to design the Avanti, \"America's only four-passenger high-performance personal car.\" It was too little, too late, and soon after, Studebaker cars were no more.\n\nLoewy went on to design for NASA, before moving back to France. He died in 1986, outliving Studebaker by a good 20 years.\n\nNo famous brand lasts forever. Right, Chrysler?",
