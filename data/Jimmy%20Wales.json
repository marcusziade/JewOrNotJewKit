  "description": "James Yerucham \"Jimmy\" Wales (born August 17, 1962[1]) is an American entrepreneur, best known for founding Wikipedia, the world's third-most popular[2] website.\n\nEarly Life\n\n\nTable tennis\n\nWales for born in Huntsville, Arkansas[3], the son of a coal miner, Horace, and a school teacher, Doris. As a child, Wales liked reading, table tennis, and encyclopedias. His favorite book was Tome 10 of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Garrison to Halibut[4]. After graduating his high school class as a valedictorian, Wales attended the Indiana State University on a table tennis scholarship[5].\n\nCareer\n\n\nWiccas\n\nWhilst at college, Wales became a practicing Wiccan. Not able to find a job after graduation, he re-discovered his early love and created \"Wiccapedia\"[6], an online encyclopaedia devoted to Wicca. Wales wrote the articles himself, but the web site did not get many readers.\n\n\n\nB. Streisand\n\nOn a whim, Wales decided to expand Wiccapedia to include all subject matter[7]. Soon after the re-launch of the newly-branded \"Wikipedia\", the first two articles written by someone else appeared: Barbra Streisand and Necrophilia[8].\n\nPersonal Life\nWales currently lives on Guam[9], where he works as a dental hygienist. He is married to his fourth wife, Christine, an anti-Internet lobbyist[10]. Wales is a father of three children and a pet chihuahua. He identifies as Jewish[11].\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ Wikipedia. \"Jimmy Wales\". Retrieved July 7, 2011.\n2. ^ Wikipedia. \"Wikipedia\". Retrieved July 6, 2011.\n3. ^ Wikipedia. \"Jimmy Wales\".
