  "description": "Italian prime ministers range from psychopathic fascists (Benito Mussolini) to journalist mafiosi (Giulio Andreotti) to prostitute-loving tycoons (Silvio Berlusconi) to... Jews. That's right, Jews.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1911, four men held the title of Italy's Prime Minister. Three of these men were Jewish.\n\nIt all started with Alessandro Fortis. The man who once fought beside national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi lasted less than a year.\n\nSidney Sonnino followed. To call him Jewish might be a tad of a stretch: his Jewish father converted out, and Sonnino was raised a Protestant. He lasted a month and a half.\n\nThe goyishe Giovanni Giolitti came next, but Sonino would return in 1909. His second term trumped his first... this time, he spent a whole three and a half months in office.\n\nFinally, there was Luigi Luzzatti. An advocate for religious tolerance, a learned man who did a huge part to strengthen Italy financially, he lasted... a year.\n\nSo, maybe Italy's Jewish prime ministers weren't exactly successful.\n\nMaybe they shouldn't have stayed away from mafia and prostitutes?",
