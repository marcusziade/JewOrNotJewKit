  "description": "College basketball has sure changed a lot over the decades, but not in its entirety. Take a look at some early national champions, and you see universities that are still relevant in today's sport: Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina... Kentucky won three titles in four years between 1948 and 1951.\n\nIt's the year that Kentucky didn't win that gave us the most glaring difference. In 1950, the NCAA title was won by CCNY... City College of New York.\n\nCCNY was coached by Nat Holman, who was an excellent player in his own right. He was described by the Basketball Hall of Fame (yes, he is a hall of famer!) as \"one of basketball's most accurate shooters and an exceptional ball-handler\". In the 1920s, Holman starred for the barnstorming Original Celtics. He did so while coaching CCNY, a job he first took in 1917 at the age of 20. Steadily improving, he built a powerhouse, culminating in the national title. (As well as the NIT title the same year; the only team to ever accomplish that.)\n\nAlas, CCNY's prominence didn't last. The next season after the title, its players got mired in a point-shaving scandal. Holman was not involved, but couldn't do anything as the college decided to de-prioritize sports. CCNY sunk into athletic obscurity.\n\nAn off-the-court controversy damaging a famed college basketball program? Did someone mention Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Kentucky? Perhaps college basketball has not changed at all...",
