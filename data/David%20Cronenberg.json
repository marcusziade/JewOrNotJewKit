  "description": "You might have seen David Cronenberg's \"The Fly\", where Jeff Goldblum mutates into a fly, with terrifying effects.\n\nYou probably have not seen Cronenberg's \"Naked Lunch\" (I can think of at least two things wrong with that title!), which, according to Roger Ebert, is filled with \"dryness, death and despair\".\n\nOr there is Cronenberg's \"Crash\" (not to be confused with the terrible Oscar-winning picture with the same name), which is about people who get sexual pleasure from traffic accidents.\n\nAnd then there is Cronenberg's \"Eastern Promises\", which sends Viggo Mortensen into the world of extreme violence and sex trafficking.\n\nWell, according to Cronenberg, ALL his films are comedies.\n\nHuh?",
