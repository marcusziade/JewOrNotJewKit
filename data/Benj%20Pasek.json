  "description": "We first wrote about the EGOT in 2010, when it was still somewhat quaint and the list of winners was somewhat exclusive. You knew these names: Mel Brooks! Audrey Hepburn! Mike Nichols! Richard Rogers! Whoopi Goldberg! (And also Jonathan Tunick.)\n\nSince then... Well, it's not like they give out EGOTs to just about anyone, but let's just say the club is not exactly as exclusive. The membership has doubled and includes such luminaries as producer Scott Rudin. He doesn't actually make the content that earns the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, or Tony; he pays for it. (Since he helps uphold the high Jew ratio among EGOT winners, we'll let him be.)\n\nWhich brings us to the latest Jewish winner, Benj Pasek, who, together with goyishe composing partner Justin Paul, has completed the EGOT in just seven years. Unless you are a fan of musicals (Grammy and Tony for \"Dear Evan Hansen\") or movie musicals (Oscar for \"La La Land\", Grammy for \"The Greatest Showman\") it's quite unlikely that you have heard of Pasek and Paul. (Their Emmy did come for a song on \"Only Murders in the Building\", which, fine, we'll give them a pass there.)\n\nWe're being too harsh, of course. Winning even one award is a huge accomplishment, and musicals are a perfectly passable pastime. (Heck, it worked for Jonathan Tunick...)",
