  "description": "Do you know who Kitty Kallen was? You, reader of our website?\n\nWe're gonna bet that you don't. And yet, for a good decade, Kitty was on the biggest stars in America.\n\nKitty was a pop singer whose career spanned the 40s and 50s: first the swing and big band era, then teetering into early rock-n-roll. She produced numerous top 10 hits, four of which reached the top spot. Those included \"Besame Mucho\" and \"Little Things Mean a Lot\", a song that was so fashionable that it topped the charts for seven months straight. Kitty's popularity was astronomical... at the time.\n\nSixty years later, Kitty's name barely rings a bell. When she passed away earlier this year, outliving most of her contemporaries, her death wasn't exactly met with many tributes.\n\nAt least you, reader of our website, now know.",
