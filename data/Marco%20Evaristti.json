  "description": "Who is this man and why is his face obscured by a goldfish in a blender?\n\nThis is contemporary artist Marco Evaristti. He is Denmark-based, Chilean-born, raised Catholic by a mother who turned out to be Jewish. He is also a serial provocateur.\n\nFor example, Evaristti hosted a dinner party... just your regular old dinner party, where delicious meatballs were served. Meatballs made with Evaristri's own fat, removed during liposuction.\n\nOr take his \"Rolexgate\" installation, which depicted the entrance gate to Auschwitz. It was made of gold... gold extracted from teeth of Holocaust victims. (You know, for all our snark, this was completely fucked up. Just absolutely disgusting in every way.)\n\nAnd then there are the goldfish... in a blender. Perhaps Evaristti's most famous \"artwork\", he set up ten blenders with real live goldfish in them, and invited museum visitors to turn them on.\n\nAre you glad you now know who Marco Evaristti is?",
