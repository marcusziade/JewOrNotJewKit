  "description": "Mr. X: I want to discuss Section 1, Paragraph 8 of our charter.\n\nMr. Y: Let's see... no Jews allowed?\n\nMr. X: You see, I have a friend... well, not a friend, more like an acquaintance... a business associate, really...\n\nMr. Y: Get on with it!\n\nMr. X: Mendel Mintz...\n\nMr. Y: The Mattress King of South Strasbourg?\n\nMr. X: The one and only. He would like to join.\n\nMr. Y: But Section 1, Paragraph 8 clearly says...\n\nMr. X: Yes, no Jews allowed. Perhaps we can make an exception?\n\nMr. Y: That's highly irregular!\n\nMr. X: Mendel has a lot of money...\n\nMr. Y: They all do!\n\nMr. X: And here's what I was thinking... We want people to think we're this all-powerful order, right?\n\nMr. Y: Duh.\n\nMr. X: But meanwhile, we just sit around in dimly-lit basements and get drunk, right?\n\nMr. Y: Duh!\n\nMr. X: Well, let's say we get blamed for something...\n\nMr. Y: For what?\n\nMr. X: I dunno, something. People like to blame secret societies for all sort of things.\n\nMr. Y: Go on...\n\nMr. X: Well, we can twist the blame back on the Jews!\n\nMr. Y: So what you're saying, if people think the Illuminati is behind something evil...\n\nMr. X: Yes...\n\nMr. Y: We'll just parade this Mendel Mintz and say it's the fault of the Jews?\n\nMr. X: Right!\n\nMr. Y: I'm not sure. I kinda like when people think we're evil. Motion denied! No Jews!",
