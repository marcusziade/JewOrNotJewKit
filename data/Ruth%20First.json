  "description": "On August 17, 1982, Ruth First, a director of research at a university in Mozambique, was assassinated. She opened a package addressed to her. Inside of it was a bomb.\n\nWhy was an academic a target of an assassination? First was a South African anti-apartheid activist, the wife of Joe Slovo, the leader of his country's communist party. The two were exiled from South Africa, but continued their plight from abroad.\n\nWho assassinated First? Well, the South African government.\n\nIt's messed up, isn't it? A country that will go to any length to protect a state of racial inequality...\n\nWe're talking about South Africa, 35 years ago.",
