  "description": "Ever since we started this website, we've had a list of people we have to profile. Since Day 1, Ayn Rand was on that list.\n\nTwo and a half years later, we've profiled such luminaries as Zac Efron and Cindy Margolis. Ayn Rand is nowhere to be found.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe're afraid of her fans.\n\nYou see, ten years ago, the Modern Library decided to rank the top 100 novels of the 20th century (Joyce's detestable masterpiece \"Ulysses\" topped the charts). No Ayn Rand novel made the list. So, a year later, an online poll ran. Rand's fans mobilized. She took the first spot. And the second. And the seventh. And the eighth.\n\nSo you can imagine our fears. For we couldn't give Rand a score high enough to please her hordes of followers. Even if we went with a 15, we're sure we would have received dozens of emails chastising us for not giving her an extra, 16th point.\n\nAnd a Jew Score of 11? We would have never heard the end of it. But honestly, how can we go higher than a 11? She might have been born into a Jewish family, but Rand didn't exactly embrace her Jewishness.\n\nHmmmm.\n\nOn second thought... let's make that 11 into an 12. Just to be safe.",
