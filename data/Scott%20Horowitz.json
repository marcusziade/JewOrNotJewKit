  "description": "We'd like to go to... Mars.\n\nMars, that small red spec in the sky. Mars, our close neighbor. Mars, perhaps humanity's salvation if (when? Please, not when!) Earth stops being hospitable...\n\nScott J. Horowitz agrees. He has been to space four times: three as a pilot and once as a commander. Six weeks of his life have been spent in orbit. Still, Horowitz is looking beyond.\n\nHis take?\n\nI fully expect that you'll see us starting to go to Mars, particularly in the 2030-ish, [20]35 timeframe, and by the fifties, fifty years from now you'll see an established Mars outpost and us going to other interesting places in the solar system.\n\nFifty years from now? So that will make us... how old? Oh.\n\nOur children would like to go to... Mars.\n\nOur children's children?",
