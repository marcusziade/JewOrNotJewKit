  "description": "If you ever visit El Paso, Texas (if you're Jewish, this premise is quite unlikely), you can stop by Dave's Pawn Shop, and, for the small price of $9,500, buy Pancho Villa's trigger finger.\n\nThat price a tad too much? Well, there's also one for sale in Europe, for a tidy $250. Can't go wrong there.\n\nOf course, it's quite possible (but don't tell that to the delusional Texan or European who's about to open his wallet to purchase his own decrepit piece of Mexican history), that neither of these fingers was once Pancho Villa's.\n\nFor Villa's death, as was his life, is shrouded in various mysteries. And one of these mysteries deals with Pancho's heritage, including a new theory that (you guessed it!) Villa was Jewish.\n\nThe theory says that Pancho's father was not Agustin Arango, but rather Luis Gurrola, a wealthy landowner of Austurian Jewish origin.\n\nBut that's just a theory... One of many.\n\nNow, the whereabouts of his skull? No one knows for sure, but we'll happily sell it to you for $500.",
