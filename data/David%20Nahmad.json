  "description": "Every now and then, we check our website's statistics to find the most popular profile. Scarlett Johansson is the reigning Queen of JONJ. It used to be Sandra Bullock. Sorry, Sandy!\n\nBut whose profile is LEAST popular? Your winner (loser?) is... world checkers champion Iser Kuperman. We guess our readers care more about Hollywood starlets than all-time board game greats. Shame on you, readers!\n\nSo here's our attempt to top (bottom?) Kuperman, to profile someone who has a chance to be even less popular. What's a notch below checkers? Dominoes? Othello? Battleship? Backgammon!\n\nBackgammon has had its share of Jewish world champions, and here is one: David Nahmad. Not only is he a Lebanese-born Jew, he is also a billionaire. No, he didn't make all that money playing backgammon, don't be ridiculous. Nahmad is also a major player on the world's art market.\n\nSo, will this profile prove to be less popular that Kuperman's? Or will we have to step down even lower on the board game scale?\n\nAre there Jewish Candyland champions?",
