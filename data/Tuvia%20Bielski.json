  "description": "Every now and then, two Hollywood studios get exactly the same idea. Remember the year with two asteroid movies? Or the two recent Snow Whites? Or the year when there were two films about Nazi-killing Jews?\n\nInglourious Basterds and... what was the other one?\n\nExactly. Everyone remembers Basterds, for a good reason. Few know of the other film that came out earlier that year, Defiance.\n\nThe difference between the two? Basterds, sadly, was completely fictional. Defiance? All too real.\n\nIt told the story of Tuvia and Zus Bielski (Daniel Craig(!) and Liev Schreiber), Belarussian Jews who escaped from the Nazis. They hid in the forest, organized a group of partisans, and rescued Jews. And, oh, yes, killed Nazis in the process. The film did take some liberties, but the Bielski brothers were very real. At one point, their camp counted over 1200 Jews that they helped rescue.\n\nSo why is Defiance remembered by few? Who knows. It's definitely worth a watch. Which is much more that we can say about either of the asteroid movies...",
