  "description": "When is the last time you spelled out BTW? You \nknow, \"by the way\"? Well, we just did. BTW, \nthat felt very weird. Who spells out BTW?\n\nBTW is just one of many Internet acronyms that \nhave taken over modern lingo. But how did it \nall start?\n\nIt can be traced back all the way to 1975, when \nStanford computer scientist Raphael Finkel \ncompiled the Jargon File, also called the \nHacker's Dictionary. Acronyms were only a small \npart of it; it contained many words that are \ncommon today (especially in the world of \ncomputers): bug, deadlock, feature, glitch, \nhack, kluge, patch... and some that didn't \nquite make it (mumblage? winnitude?).\n\nThe Jargon File has been evolving since, but \nFinkel has long left the project. After helping \na new language to come to life, he is now \ntrying to keep another language from dying:\n\nYiddish.",
