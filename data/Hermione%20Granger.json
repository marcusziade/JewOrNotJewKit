  "description": "In the Severus Snape profile, we proclaimed that there are no Jews in Harry Potter, other than the useless Anthony Goldstein. Yet we keep getting emails from our readers that just might make us change our mind.\n\nHermione Granger: Smart. Nerdy. Nagger. And both of her parents are dentists. Isn't that the Jewish stereotype?\n\nAnd what's more, Hermione is not too keen on celebrating Christmas. (As an aside, it always puzzled us how these wizards and witches celebrate the birth of Christ. Anyway...) Most good Christians spend that day with their families. Hermione? She either ditches her family for her friends, or she and her family go on skiing vacations, which, we are told, is quite uncommon for Christians to do on this, the holiest day of their year. (Or is that Easter? Always confused us. Anyway...)\n\nSo, there is enough circumstantial evidence for us to enact the wonderful Gargamel Law and declare Hermione Jewish if we so desire. And since \"Granger\" is an obvious goy name, we will proclaim Hermione as half Jewish, through her mother. (But no, she's obviously not practicing. Won't be the first atheist Jew we've profiled, that's for sure. Anyway...)\n\nSeriously, both her parents are DENTISTS. How can she be NOT Jewish?",
