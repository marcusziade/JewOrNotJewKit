  "description": "You know what Biblical figure has always annoyed us to no end? Job.\n\nYes, poor Job, who loved G-d so much that he took the shitstorm that was sent down without bating an eyelash. Take my money? Sure. Take my health? Sure. Take my children? Sure! You know better, G-d. I still love you, G-d. I am unworthy, G-d.\n\nTalk about a pussy.\n\nIf we ever learned anything from being Jewish, is that Jews don't take shit lying down. Jews don't bend down to the powers that be. Jews question, Jews ask why, Jews always, always look for answers. Even if G-d is the culprit. Especially if G-d is the culprit.\n\nAnd what about Job? Well, Job was rewarded for his submission. He got new wealth, new health, and even new children. Praising G-d, as his original children were rotting in their graves.\n\nTalk about a schmuck.\n\nWe could say more, but...\n\nHasn't the man suffered enough already?",
