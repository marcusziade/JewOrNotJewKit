  "description": "Back in 2011, we profiled Gru from \"Despicable Me\". Eight years! Boy, does time fly...\n\nLittle did we know back then that the breakout stars of that film would be the Minions, a strange-talking yellow-skinned race that has conquered everything from toy stores (err... it's 2019, there are no more toy stores, but you get our drift) to memes to Jewish rumors... Yes, you heard that one right.\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nThe rumors come attached with this picture that claims that \"minions were jew [sic] kids adopted by nazi scientists for their experiments\". Supposedly, these Nazis were testing gas on Jewish children before spreading it to concentration camps.\n\nYeah, not so much. That picture comes from 1908, and has nothing to do with Nazis or Jews, children or otherwise. It's a submarine escape apparatus. Early subs were not exactly safe, and this contraption was designed to keep people alive... not kill them in gas chambers.\n\nBack in 2011, the sole idea that some baseless Nazi rumor would force us to prove that the Minions are not Jewish would be seen as incredibly absurd.\n\nYet here we are.",
