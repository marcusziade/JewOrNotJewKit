Here's a letter we recently received. \n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I just read your Daniel Snyder profile (you need to update it!), where you suggest that Jews who want to get into the NFL become franchise owners. Is there another way? â€” Ben Tuchman, 15, Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nDear Ben, have you considered sports journalism? There is a large tradition of Jews covering the NFL through the years: from Howard Cosell to Chris Berman to Rich Eisen to Jay Glazer. And that's just on TV; we're not even talking about print media. (Of course, by the time you enter the job force, there won't be any print media...)\n\nYes, before you ask, Jay Glazer is Jewish! Doesn't exactly come off as one, but he definitely he is. Somewhat of a hot bag of air, too. Where were we?...\n\nOh, yes, sports journalism! Just don't expect it to pay well. If that's what you're into, better hold out for franchise owner.\n\nYours in disappointing career choices,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
