Who the hell is John Houseman?\n\nAs it turns out, John Houseman was a producer who also dabbled in acting. He is known for: collaborating with Orson Wells (including on \"Citizen Kane\"), winning Best Supporting Actor for \"The Paper Chase\", and being the spokesperson for the Smith Barney brokerage firm (it no longer exists). Quite the range, if you ask us, but doesn't explain the name.\n\nWhat explains it is Houseman's distinctive British accent, utilized, among other venues, in his Oscar-winning role. Houseman stretched his vowels for a sense of sinister superiority. Seinfeld and Larry David developed dueling impressions, which they carried into the episode. Hence, the Beeeeeeeerg.\n\nInterestingly, despite the accent, Houseman himself wasn't that British. He was born in Romania; his father was Jewish. His original last name was Haussmann.\n\nHaaaaaaaussmann? How is that for a good John Houseman name?",
