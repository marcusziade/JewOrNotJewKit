The man who sings that song is not only a Jew, but a recipient of one of the highest scores on this website??? This makes no sense!\n\nOh, but it does. And it's sad that the Anti-Defamation League has such an issue with Baron Cohen; they should really get their head out of their tuchus. What exactly is wrong when he, in his getup as Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev, gets on stage at an Arizona bar and belts out \"In my country there's a problem, and that problem is the Jews\" as redneck spectators sing along?\n\nHave a sense of humor, Anti-Defamation League. Baron Cohen is EXPOSING antisemitism, not perpetrating it! If you are having problems with that song alone, just you wait until the Borat movie comes out.\n\nDzienkuje!",
