  "description": "So, Jew or Not Jew, how come you haven't commented on HBO's \"Girls\" yet? After all, everyone who is anyone on the Internet has said something about it, and you seem to discuss every Jewish-related HBO show ever (even Arli$$! ARLI$$!!!), and creator/writer/director/actress Lena Dunham clearly stated she's Jewish...\n\nWell, we're glad you asked!\n\nFirst of all, since the Internet clearly forces everyone to take a side on this debate, we're gonna say: pro. It's a good show. It's a good show... just not made for us. And it has nothing to do with gender.\n\nWe're in our thirties. We have families and mortgages. Watching \"Girls\" is like peeking through a window to an alien world. Oh, sure, these characters are just ten years younger than us, but it might as well be a hundred. The quote from the pilot about it being the voice of a generation has been oft-repeated, and we're not here to argue if it is. It's just not our generation.\n\nThat being said, we'll continue to watch, if only to marvel at those who are younger. And to applaud Dunham for making two of the four main characters Jewish.\n\nOh, and for the awkward sex scenes.\n\nAren't you glad you asked?",
