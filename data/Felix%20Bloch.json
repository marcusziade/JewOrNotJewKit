  "description": "Stop us if you heard this one:\n\nSomewhere in the bunker underneath Switzerland, the end of the universe is getting closer.\n\nNo, no, no! We're not talking about THAT bunker. And, to be totally precise, the bunker we're talking about is not exactly underneath Switzerland. It's underneath Switzerland AND France.\n\nWe're talking about the Large Hadron Collider, natch. It was trying to make particles, well, collide, which was supposed to end the universe or something. Well, that hasn't happened. Whew.\n\nThe LHC is the brainchild of CERN, the European think tank that collects some of the best minds across the continent. Its first Director General was Felix Bloch, a Swiss Jew, who won the Physics Nobel in 1952.\n\nSo there are Jews in a bunker underneath Switzerland!\n\n... and France.",
