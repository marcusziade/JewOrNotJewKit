  "description": "Here's something we can't figure out: why do people keep suggesting that we profile Jennifer Love Hewitt?\n\nShe doesn't look Jewish. She doesn't act Jewish. She is not Jewish. Then why?\n\nPerhaps it's because she plays a Jew in the movie \"Jewtopia\"?\n\nYou haven't heard of it? Well, we're here to remedy that. Here, let us summarize:\n\n\"Jewtopia\" is a story of a goy who falls for a Jewish woman and pretends to be Jewish for her.\n\nDoesn't ring a bell? It's fairly recent. We watched it. Yes, Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a Jew. We'll let the critics say the rest:\n\n\"Offensive to almost everyone.\" \"An appalling array of hideous ethic and gender stereotypes.\" \"Witless and asinine.\" \"Watching it will give you a vision of hell.\"\n\nNo. It can't be this movie. There is no way all these suggesters watched that dreck.\n\nThen why?",
