  "description": "Dear Mr. Brin and Mr. Page,\n\nWe'll cut right to the chase. We're here to present you an offer to buy JewOrNotJew.com. What is in it for you?\n\nFirst of all, it will cost you less than YouTube, and we guarantee a better percentage return on investment than that purchase.\n\nSecond of all, you could rename it to Jewoogle, or Joogle, or whatever suits you.\n\nThird of all, you'll be able to split up your profiles. You will no longer be \"Sergey Brin and Larry Page\", you could be \"Sergey Brin\" and \"Larry Page\". If Yakov Smirnoff gets his own profile, why not you?\n\nFourth of all, you'd be able to modify your profiles. So, Mr. Page, if you wanted to knock down your Jew Score because you're atheist, you could. Or, Mr. Brin, if you wanted to remove the following sentence: \"Sergey Brin is the second most important Russian American Jew after Yakov Smirnoff\", you could. In fact, you could remove all mentions of Yakov Smirnoff from this profile. You wouldn't want Google to pick up the association between Sergey Brin and Yakov Smirnoff, would you?\n\nSo, if you would like to take us up on our offer, our email is listed on the bottom of this page. But act quick; Yahoo! just might be interested. Who says that Jerry Yang does not come from a line of Yangsteins?\n\nSincerely,\n\nJew or Not Jew",
