Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, what do I do with my thick eyebrows? I'm just 14, and I already look like my great aunt Muriel! Help! â€” Leah Steingold, 14, New York, New York\n\nDear Leah, before responding, let us first find a picture of your great aunt Muriel. Egads! That's not a good look.\n\nYes, many Jewish women have felt the curse of the eyebrow. Must be in the genes. That being said, perhaps you should embrace them? Look at Lily Collins! (Yes, we know, she is only a quarter Jewish: dad Phil clearly isn't.) She OWNS those eyebrows. Those eyebrows are her calling card. You think she is getting Hollywood roles without those eyebrows? (Alright, dad Phil clearly helps.)\n\nYours in facial hair growth,\n\nJew or Not Jew",
