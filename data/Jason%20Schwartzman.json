A reader from Seattle wants us to profile Jason Schwartzman because \"he's pretty awesome and super cool\".\n\nHmmm. Jason Schwartzman, you say? Pretty awesome and super cool? Hmmmm.\n\nWe wonder, dear reader, do you really know Mr. Schwartzman, or do you get your impression from his roles? Sure, he might be pretty awesome as Max Fischer in \"Rushmore\" and super cool as Jonathan Ames in \"Bored to Death\", but in real life? And, besides, what's awesome and cool to one might be lame and trite to another.\n\nYou see, wonderful reader, what you should have written is that we should profile Schwartzman because he is an interesting case of Hollywood royalty marrying into Judaism. Jason is the son of actress Talia Shire (Adrien in \"Rocky\", Connie in \"Godfather\"), the sister of Francis Ford Coppola. Talia married producer Jack Schwartzman, who was Jewish, but Jason was raised without religion.\n\nSeriously, faithful readers, you're gonna have to try harder if you want us to follow up on your suggestions...",
