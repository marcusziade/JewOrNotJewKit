  "description": "Joshua Angrist got the 2021 Nobel in Economics (shared with two goyim) for \"methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships\". Can you imagine the research?\n\nNow, Joshua does have a wife named Mira, an Israeli-born professor at Boston University. What exactly was her opinion of her husband's methodological work?\n\nWe're being a bit silly, of course. Angrist did not actually have to participate in these casual relationships himself. Perhaps he simply hid in a closet with a video camera? Then spent days upon days rewinding to catch all the minuscule details? All that analysis could not have been simple...\n\nStop it, Jew or Not Jew! You misread the premise; it's \"causal\", not \"casual\"! Angrist is actually one of the world's foremost experts in economics of both labor and education...\n\nSure, but where is the fun in that?",
