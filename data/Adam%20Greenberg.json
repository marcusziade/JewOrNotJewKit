  "description": "Yesterday, Adam Greenberg appeared for the Miami Marlins against the New York Mets, striking out in his only at-bat. An absolutely inconsequential player in an absolutely inconsequential game between two absolutely inconsequential teams. So why did it make such a difference?\n\nUntil yesterday, Greenberg's only appearance in the majors came seven years ago, when he was an up-and-comer with the Chicago Cubs. He faced exactly one pitch... which hit him in the head. For baseball stat heads, that's 1 GP, 1 PA, 0 AB, 1 HBP, 1.000 OBP. Not for one game. For Greenberg's career. Fodder for baseball historians.\n\nGreenberg suffered a concussion and was not able to return to the field... not on that day, not for years after. He played in the minors, hoping against hope for a call which would not come. This year, a petition started to get him a second chance. The Cubs passed; the Marlins, ironically the team that hit him in the first place, decided to give him a shot. One at-bat. Yesterday. He is now 0-1... but at least he has a batting average.\n\nSo was it worth it? Well, Greenberg has been looking towards this day for years, so it probably was for him. Even if he is no longer fodder for baseball historians.",
