  "description": "Is grunge the new disco? Hear us out.\n\nIn the 90s, everyone was making fun of disco. The music that swept through the world just two decades earlier became an ancient relic. And the clothes! Oh, the horrible clothes!\n\nToday, everyone is making fun of grunge. Can you believe people were into that depressing shit? And the clothes! Oh, the horrible clothes!\n\nEven people like Chris Cornell have moved away from grunge. (Yes, we know that Soundgarden recently reunited, but it's clearly not the same. And, yes, we know that Cornell claimed his mother is Jewish, but there is no evidence of Jewish heritage in his family.)\n\nYou know what... let's make a stand for grunge. To simply call it depressing is to reduce it to a triviality. To compare it to disco is to ignore its depth. It was a groundbreaking shift in music. It was the voice of a generation...\n\nAnd the clothes?\n\nYeah, the clothes were horrible.",
