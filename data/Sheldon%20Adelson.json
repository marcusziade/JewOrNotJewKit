  "description": "Today, JONJ is on a quest. We are gonna try to find out who is the world's richest Jew. No peeking!\n\nFor that, we will go down the list of the world's richest people, until we hit a Jew. Should be easy enough.\n\n#1. Bill Gates. 56 billion. Not a Jew.\n\n#2. Warren Buffett. 52 billion. Not a Jew.\n\n#3. Carlos Slim Helu. 49 billion. Mexican. We're willing to bet that no one named Carlos has ever been a Jew. This one isn't either.\n\n#4. Ingvar Kamprad. 33 billion. Swedish. Joined a pro-Nazi group during World War II. Says he regrets it. We own some of his furniture. Not a Jew.\n\n#5. Lakshmi Mittal. 32 billion. Indian. Do we even have to look it up? Not a Jew.\n\n#6. Sheldon Adelson. 26.5 billion. What's that... Jew? Yes!\n\nSo now it's time to dig through the family records and find out if we're related. Uncle Sheldy? The dream can't be that far-fetched, right?",
