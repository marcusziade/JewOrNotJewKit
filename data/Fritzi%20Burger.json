  "description": "When we tried to discover who was the first Jew to win a Winter Olympic medal, we ran into Friederike \"Fritzi\" Burger. A champion figure skater from Austria, she won silver medals in 1928 and 1932, finishing behind the famed Sonja Henie.\n\nSo why such a low K Score?\n\nEven though Burger was Jewish, she was registered as a Catholic (considering what happened in Europe soon after, not the biggest sin). But Burger's apostasy went beyond paperwork: supposedly, she denounced her Jewish roots.\n\nBurger spent World War II in Japan, married to one of the country's richest men. At the same time she was entertaining that country's elite, her family was being slaughtered by Japan's Axis allies.\n\nSo let's say that the first Jew to win a Winter Olympic medal was previously-profiled Irving Jafee, who took two speed skating golds in 1932. We like that answer much more than Fritzi...",
