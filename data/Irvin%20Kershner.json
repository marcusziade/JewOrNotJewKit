  "description": "What is the best Star Wars film?\n\nThe prequels are easily dispensed with. Attack of the Clowns might have the worst dialogue ever written for anything ever. Phantom Menace has its moments, but a punchbowl with a turd in it is still undrinkable. And Revenge of the Sith is a good Star Wars film only as a sort of faded reflection of everything we like about the good Star Wars films. So no.\n\nThat leaves us to the three originals. Return of the Jedi has a great opening set piece and the final space battle is good fun. But there's one major problem: ewoks. And thus we move on.\n\nThe original Star Wars... what can we say? It's the zadeh of them all. But as a movie, well... well, have you seen it recently? It takes forever to get going, the fun parts are few and far between, it's just... Well it's not a bad movie, but much like star Harrison Ford it sure has been coasting on its reputation for a while...\n\nThat leaves Empire, and, thankfully, we can say Empire is one heck of a good movie. Great action pieces, nice character moments, cool backward talking muppet, that movie has everything and even has the balls to end on a down note. Even better, Empire was directed by the Jewish (no matter how much he may protest he never studied, he was born that way) Irvin Kershner.\n\nSo there's your answer. Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film. Maybe even the only good Star Wars film. Oy. We'll stop here, lest we get ganked by someone in a Chewbacca costume in the near future...",
