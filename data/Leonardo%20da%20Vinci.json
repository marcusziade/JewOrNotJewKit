  "description": "Leonardo da Vinci is now more popular than ever. Thanks to a best-selling book, and the millions of controversies and explanations that it spawned, the man has risen to an iconoclastic, mystical, legendary status. That said, what's he doing on this website? With such a high Jew Score?\n\nWell, there is evidence that old Leo was half Jewish; his mother might have been a Jew from the Caucasus, an immigrant or possibly a slave. And although that theory might or might not hold water, it definitely makes Leo more than a viable candidate for JONJ.\n\nMoreover, there is supposedly Jewish symbolism in his art. That said, with the scrutiny his work has taken over the years, we're pretty sure one can find Eskimo symbolism, if they tried hard enough. That fish bone on the table in \"The Last Supper\"? Eskimo! But we digress.\n\nWhich leaves us at the Jew Score and verdict. Can we trust the theory? Can we put faith in symbolism? Does that make him at least \"Barely a Jew\"?\n\nWhat's this? There are now theories that his mother might have possibly been an Arab? Oh, why can't we just let sleeping dogs lie...\n\n(Editor's update, 2023: Apparently, a researcher has \"proven\" that Leonardo's mom was Jewish. Then why all the Jesus love, Leo?)",
