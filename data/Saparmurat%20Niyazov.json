  "description": "Could we have a new member of our exclusive Triple Zero Club?\n\nSaparmurat Niyazov was a great man. Leader of Turkmenistan from 1985 to 2006, first as First Secretary of the Communist Party, then President (For Life), he led his country through an epic time. Change swept through Turkmenistan. Numerous reforms transformed it from a backwater Soviet Republic into the glorious nation we know today. Or, you know, not.\n\nAmong Niyazov's numerous accomplishments were: changing the names of the days of the week and the months (April, for instance, got renamed after his mother), firing most of the country's doctors and nurses, creating numerous holidays (including the glorious Day of the Melon), outlawing long hair, mustaches, and beards, building a rotating gold statue (of himself), banning video games, opera, and the circus, and building an ice palace in the middle of the desert. Sadly, some of his dreams failed: his desire for a zoo with penguins couldn't survive the 100 degree heat, and no one knows what came of his plan to build the world's largest shoe.\n\nSo could The Father of All Turkmens get that ever-elusive 0 Jew Score? Nope! As regular readers know, goyim who marry Jews get a token point on the I Score, and the Forerver Great Niyazov will get just that! Sure, he and his wife were separated for the last 20 years of his life, but rules are rules.\n\nSo, no new member of the Triple Zero Club. Just as well; we like to keep it exclusive...",
