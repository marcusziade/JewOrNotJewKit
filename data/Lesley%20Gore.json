  "description": "Take a look at the \"See Also\" section of this profile. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lindsay Lohan... Now take a look at the woman pictured on the left. What does she have to do with any of them?\n\nWell, before Britney and Christina, before Lindsay, Mandy, and various others, there was Lesley. Lesley Goldstein... err, make that Lesley Gore, who was the original teeny-bop sensation back in the early 60s with \"It's My Party (And I'll Cry If I Want To)\". (Her debut album and six of its songs had the word \"Cry\" in the title. What kind of message is that to send to girls? Anyway...)\n\nAnyway, \"It's My Party\" hit number one on the pop charts in 1963, and Lesley followed it up with more hits, including \"You Don't Own Me\", \"That's the Way Boys Are\", and \"Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows\". But, as music started to change in the late 60s, her popularity rapidly declined. (Cue the crying.)\n\nLesley attempted a comeback in the 2000s, coming out as a lesbian and putting out a new album. It didn't exactly sell, but was well received critically. So you see, Britney and Christina, there is still hope for you down the line...\n\nLindsay? We wouldn't hold our breath.",
