  "description": "At Jew or Not Jew, we take our delicatessens seriously. The pastrami has to be just right. And the corned beef? Don't get us started on the corned beef.\n\nSo as we travel across the country, we don't visit too many delis. You just won't get the New York quality in Indiana. Not too many Jews in Indiana. Or Idaho. Or Iowa.\n\nWell, maybe in Iowa? Elijah Wood's parents were deli owners. G-d knows why Jews would ever move to Iowa, but...\n\nWait a minute. Just wait a minute. Elijah Wood is Jewish, right? He is, after all, very short, and... ummmm... he played a Jew in \"Everything Illuminated\" (as an aside, a terrific movie based on an even more wonderful book), and... ummmm... his name is Elijah, which, in theory...\n\nNope. Not Jewish. Raised Catholic.\n\nWell, it's not like we would visit Iowa in the first place.",
