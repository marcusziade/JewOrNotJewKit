  "description": "After writing 200 of these, we ask ourselves, what makes an average JONJ profile? So we plugged the numbers into the super-duper-powerful JONJ computer (you might know it as \"Microsoft Windows Calculator\"), and came up with the average.\n\nThe average JONJ profile is an actor, who could possibly fit in another category. (Say... comedians. Or musicians. But not scientists. Definitely not scientists.)\n\nThe average JONJ profile has a Jew Score of 4/3/4, with the 4 for the I and K Scores being a tad weak.\n\nSo the average JONJ profile seemed to perfectly fit Jack Black. Actor, comedian, musician, 100% Jewish (but his father converted, hence a \"weak\" 4 for the I Score). The O and the K work out as well. (We had some doubts on the K; when he is on, Black makes us laugh, but he really should pick his roles a bit better. Seriously, have you seen \"Nacho Libre\"? No? Please don't bother.)\n\nThe average JONJ profile ends with the following two words.",
