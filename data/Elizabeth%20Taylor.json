  "description": "So, it's about time we discussed Elizabeth Taylor. We're closing in on 500 profiles, and not having one of the most famous leading ladies of all time seems to be a glaring omission.\n\nEspecially since she is Jewish, converting in 1959. She was influenced by the rabbi of her third husband, Mike Todd, to help overcome the grief resulting from Todd's death in a plane crash.\n\nBut we have a problem. What photograph do we use? Because depending whether we go with young or old Liz, the tone of the profile would be vastly different.\n\nIf we choose young Liz, we would talk of her as one of the greatest beauties of our time, and applaud her conversion to Judaism. A K Score of a 4 would be a minimum.\n\nIf we choose old Liz, we would talk of what a joke she's become, and make fun of her failed marriages and exuberant makeup. We'd deride her conversion, ask her to return to her original faith, and set the K Score at 2 or below.\n\nSo which one will it be?\n\nHmmmm.\n\nk = 0;\ninterval = 5000;\nsetTimeout('loadPic()', interval );\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nif (x == null) { k++; x = k%2; }\nu = 'e/elizabeth_taylor';\nif (x == 1) u = 'taylor';\nsetImage(u);\nsetTimeout('loadPic()', interval);\n}",
