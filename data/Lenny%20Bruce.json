One is thinking, \"what juvenile a-holes\", and leaving this website never to return again. Good fucking riddance.\n\nThe other half is thinking, \"what's the big fucking deal\", and continuing to read in order to find out whether comedian Lenny Bruce was Jewish. (You don't have to skip to the end. He was. His real name was Leonard Schneider.)\n\nOf course, we're not the first website to swear. Nor the last. Big fucking deal indeed.\n\nBut when Lenny Bruce got on stage and let those swear words fly, big fucking deal it was. How big was it? In 1961, he was arresting for obscenity, for uttering that same word, \"cocksucker\", with which we opened the profile.\n\nWhat bullshit! Can you imagine that happening now?\n\nBoy, have we advanced as a people.\n\nFuck yeah!\n\nFuck... yeah?",
