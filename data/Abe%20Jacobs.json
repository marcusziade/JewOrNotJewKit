  "description": "As most know, New Zealand is made up of two main islands, imaginatively named North and South. However, there are smaller islands as well. For example, the South Island is not even the most southern island! There is Stewart Island, population 450 humans and quite a few penguins.\n\nAnd then there are the Chatham Islands, located some 800 kilometers east. Only two of them are habitable, housing 730 people (and, don't worry, some penguins!) What do these 730 people do? Farm and fish, mostly. Welcome a few lost tourists.\n\nAre there any Jews on Chatham Islands? There definitely were, and one of them actually warrants inclusion on our website. Abe Jacobs, who came from a family of cattle farmers, actually rose to prominence as a professional wrestler in America in the 1960s and 70s. He was billed as...\n\n\"The Jewish Heavyweight Champion\".\n\nIt wasn't explained how he got that title. Did he wrestle other heavyweight Jews to take the crown? Did the title get bestowed on him by default? Was it just a lark to lure Jewish wrestling fans?\n\nWho knows. Probably beats farming cattle on the Chatham Islands!",
