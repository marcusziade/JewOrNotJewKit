  "description": "Craig Mazin is known for creating two very highly acclaimed shows, both of which aired on HBO.\n\nOne show is about a disaster that leaves the world in a terrible state. Scientists are puzzled at what caused this catastrophe. What was once lush land is now uninhabitable. Beware those who try to venture outside! Death roams the streets. The government tries its best to keep people in line, but it's not exactly working. A few brave souls try to uncover the truth, to forge a path for those who remain. Spoiler alert: it doesn't exactly work.\n\nThat show?\n\n\"The Last of Us\".\n\nAlso?\n\n\"Chernobyl\".",
