  "description": "You might have heard. The McCain-Palin ticket lost the election. Got whooped, actually. Shellacked. Destroyed.\n\nBut we're not worried about John McCain. He'll do fine.\n\nAnd we're not worried about Sarah Palin. She has a long career ahead of her.\n\nWe're worried about Tina Fey. Everything peaked for her this year: Emmy Award for Best Comedy. Emmy Award for Best Actress. And countless raves about her portrayal of Palin on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nHow is she gonna live up to that? \"30 Rock\" has no place to go but down. And how could she ever top the Palin impression? Especially with Sarah out of the spotlight. If only she could stay relevant for a little bit longer...\n\nBut then we thought, why should we worry about Tina Fey? She's Greek Orthodox, not Jewish.",
