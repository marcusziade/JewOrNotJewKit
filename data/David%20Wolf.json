  "description": "Did you know that you — yes, YOU — can time travel? For real. We're not kidding.\n\nAll you need to do is become an astronaut. Tall order, we know, but not completely out of realm of possibility, even for us Jews!\n\nThen you need to go into space... for a while. You see, because of spacecraft's fast speed, objects in orbit actually age slower than their counterparts on Earth.\n\nTake astronaut David Wolf, for instance. He has been in space for 168 days, eight hours, and 57 minutes — the most ever for a Jew! In that time, he has time traveled into the future by... give us a minute for calculations... 42 milliseconds. Give or take a couple.\n\nSo, no, the effect is not exactly spectacular. But here are worse news: if you go far enough into space, you actually age faster than you would on Earth.\n\nOn second thought... let's pass on time travel!",
