  "description": "Watching \"Oppenheimer\" is akin to who-is-who of JONJ's Scientists category: Albert Einstein! Niels Bohr! Isidor Isaac Rabi! Edward Teller! Hans Bethe! Leo Szilard! And, of course, J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by the goyishe Cillian Murphy, but the resemblance is definitely there).\n\nAnd then we have someone who was not exactly a scientist, but did chair the Atomic Energy Commission and therefore had a large role in American nuclear research: Lewis Strauss. (Pronounced, as Robert Downey Jr. clearly enunciates, \"Staws\".) Proudly, undeniably Jewish.\n\nProudly, undeniably evil? \"Oppenheimer\" definitely paints Strauss as the villain of the story, hellbent on getting his way no matter what the cost. This includes discrediting the titular character, the man, who, for better or for worse, will forever be known as \"the father of the atomic bomb\".\n\nOf course, in real life, Strauss was not purely villainous. In the 1930s, he lobbied the US government to save more Jews from Nazi Germany, mostly unsuccessfully. So not everything is black and white...\n\nWhich was precisely the point of \"Oppenheimer\".",
