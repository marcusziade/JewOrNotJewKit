  "description": "Today, we sat out to profile Kathleen Turner. No, Turner is not Jewish, but she was married to a Jew for 23 years, and raised her daughter Jewish, and even says that she believes in G-d in \"more in a Judeo than a Christian way, because I dislike the form of religion that was forced on me\". So that's nice.\n\nSo, as we always do, we had to find a picture to go with the profile. Easy, we said. Kathleen Turner, wow! \"Body Heat\"! \"Romancing the Stone\"! Boy, do we love \"Romancing the Stone\", and let us tell you, it's not because of Michael Douglas' bare ass. Kathleen Turner, wow!\n\nIt did not turn out to be easy. For all the wow pictures from the 80s, we got a glimpse of Turner today. Now, we know that not everyone ages gracefully, but...\n\nKathleen... Turner?... Wow?\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nswapPic('k/kathleen_turner', 'turner');\n}",
