  "description": "Ehhhh... What's up, docs? Looks like there is some stuff out there about Bugs Bunny possibly being Jewish. Let's see if we can figure this one out.\n\nRabbits are not kosher\nBugs passes our Berenstein Bears Law, so it's possible that he could be Jewish.\n\nBugs speaks with a New York accent\nNot all New Yorkers are Jews. Sorry, rest of the country.\n\nBugs was partly based on Groucho Marx, Jew\nA point for the Jew camp.\n\nBugs was voiced by Mel Blanc, Jew\nNormally, that will give the Jew theory more traction, but Blanc voiced pretty much every Looney Tunes character... including Porky Pig. And we're not having Porky Pig, thank you very much.\n\nBugs' original name was Happy Rabbit\nLet's face it, the odds for a Jew to be (named) Happy are quite low.\n\nBugs' two main enemies, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam, are obvious goyim\nCan't argue there, but why would that make Bugs Jewish?\n\nSo, as you see, there's just not enough evidence to proclaim him a Jew. Of course, that hasn't stopped us before. Except for one very important thing:\n\nWe proclaimed Daffy Duck as Jewish\nAnd having both Daffy and Bugs as Jews just seems prepothterous... Sorry, docs.",
