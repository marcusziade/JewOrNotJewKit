Never heard of Goldie and the Gingerbreads? They were the first ever all-girl rock band.\n\nAlright, fine, they probably weren't the first females who decided to jam together. But back in 1962, they were the first all-woman band to be signed to a major record label. The Goldie in question was the nickname of the lead singer, Genya Zelkowitz (who later became known as Genya Ravan).\n\nHow successful were Goldie and the Gingerbreads?\n\nWell, they weren't The Pussycats Dolls...\n\nAnd they weren't Destiny's Child...\n\nAnd... well, you get the idea.",
