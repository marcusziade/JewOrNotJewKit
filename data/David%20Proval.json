  "description": "While watching the Sopranos prequel movie, we were reminded of David Proval. Who, you ask? The actor who played Tony's biggest antagonist on Season 2 of the show, Richie Aprile. Does that ring a bell?\n\nFor those who don't remember, Wikipedia has a rather detailed rundown of Aprile's storyline, from his backstory, to his getting out of prison, to his rise to prominence, to his eventual (Do you need a spoiler alert? It's the Sopranos, after all!) death. All in all, it clocks in at 532 words. (And if you go to the Sopranos Wikia, it's 1400 words, in all its gory detail.)\n\nDavid Proval, the actor? His Wikipedia article, once you remove all the acting credits (and it sure is chock-full of those, with over 100 roles on TV and in movies) is... quite sparse. No backstory. No rise to acting prominence. No death (not yet, at least). It boils down to the following 32 words:\n\nDavid Aaron Proval (born May 20, 1942) is an American actor. Proval was born in Brooklyn, New York into a Jewish family, the son of Clara Katz, an actress from Bucharest, Romania.",
