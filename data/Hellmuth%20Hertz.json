  "description": "Carl Hellmuth Hertz came from quite a scientific family. His father, Gustav Hertz, won the Physics Nobel in 1925. His uncle, Heinrich Hertz, discovered electromagnetic waves and is the namesake of the hertz, the unit of frequency.\n\nHellmuth himself was not too shabby in the scientific arena. In fact, pretty much every parent in the modern world had one of their happiest memories due to his creation.\n\nCarl Hellmuth Hertz invented the ultrasound. Yep, those first moments you saw your yet-unborn child were due to this German-born Swede with some Jewish heritage! So why such a low K Score?\n\nDespite that Jewish heritage, this Hertz actually served in the Nazi army during World War II. Which, you know, conscripted or not, is not exactly great.\n\nStill, what an accomplished family!",
