Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, you've done me wrong! I showed my parents your Itzhak Perlman profile, where you said that kids shouldn't be pushed into music, and you know what they did? They said, look who this is about — Perlman! Now practice harder! I hate the violin! This sucks! And it's all your fault! — Ari Frum, 14, New York, New York\n\nDear Ari,\n\nPlease accept our apologies. It seems that our attempts at wit went over your parents' heads. Wont be the first time, that's for sure.\n\nPerhaps if Perlman is not the best example, you can tell them about Benjamin Kubelsky? His parents made him play the violin, but he hated to practice. So Benjamin became Jack Benny, comedian, one of the biggest stars of American stage, radio, and television, a career that spanned decades. With the trusty violin by his side...\n\nOh. That's right. Even though Benny didn't become a virtuoso, he never gave up the violin, using it in his act. On second thought, maybe he is not the best example... Apologies.\n\nYours in hatred of string instruments,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
