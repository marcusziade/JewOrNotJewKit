  "description": "We apologize in advance for the following sentence.\n\nSHOW ME THE JEWS!\n\nWe're really, really, really sorry.\n\nApology accepted? Good? Let's move on.\n\nJerry Maguire? Tom Cruise? Jewish? In what world?\n\nPerhaps in this very world. Maguire was based on sports agent Leigh Steinberg, a Jew.\n\nBut... for us, that's not enough. The movie is not called \"Leigh Steinberg\" or even \"Jerry Steinberg\". The name was goyified for a reason: Cruise, with his limited acting ability, just can't play a Jew (unless you put him in a fat suit and make him a caricature like in \"Tropic Thunder\"). So, writer/director Cameron Crowe probably had that in mind when casting Cruise, so he took away the Jewishness and made the title character into an obvious gentile.\n\nSo, are there Jews in \"Jerry Maguire\"? Well, the \"adorable\" kid who stole America's hearts, Jonathan Lipnicki, is Jewish. But we're not really clamoring to profile him.\n\nAnd again, we're very very sorry for that sentence.",
