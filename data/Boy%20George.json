  "description": "One of the things we've made very clear since the beginning of this website is our distaste for Kabbalists. \n\nIt all seems like \"pop culture Judaism\" to us — Jewish dianetics is the term we used previously — and we have missed no opportunity to ridicule its many clearly confused celebrity adherents.\n\nBut what happens if the person is really into it? After all, a lot of our supposition comes from the fact that the star in question is participating in the equivalent of Diet Judaism — the same great holier-than-thou taste with only half the guilt! But what if they actually get into it, pardon the expression, whole hog?\n\nDoing things like, for instance, getting a huge tattoo of a Jewish star on the top of their heads?\n\nWould we then commend them? After all, isn't full dedication to Judaism honorable? Even if it's stupid, made up, Americanized, cult Judaism? Isn't that enough to make us respect these poor, lost, celebrity souls for the Jews they truly feel they are?\n\nActually, no. No it isn't.",
