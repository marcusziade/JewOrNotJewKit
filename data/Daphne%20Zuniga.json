  "description": "\"Oh, that's all we needed. A Druish princess!\"\n\nSpaceballs! When people get asked about their favorite Mel Brooks movies, you'll hear \"The Producers\", \"Blazing Saddles\", \"Young Frankenstein\", or \"History of the World\". You will rarely hear \"Spaceballs\" (and NEVER \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\". Leslie Nielsen, RIP).\n\nAnd yet, \"Spaceballs\" is pretty darn funny. Especially if you're into the whole making-fun-of-Star-Wars-and-Star-Trek thing. And you know us. We're into that thing.\n\nAlso: you know how Brooks promised \"Jews in Space!\" in \"History of the World\"? Well, you got them right here! We have the director himself in multiple roles (including Yogurt, the wise Yiddish-accented master). Then, there's Joan Rivers, Rick Moranis, the Schwartz(!), and the whole Druish-princess-with-the-nose-job subplot.\n\n\"Funny, she doesn't look Druish.\"\n\nHave to agree there...",
