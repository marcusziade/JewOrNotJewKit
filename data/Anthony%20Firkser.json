  "description": "You know what seems like an outlier? There were seven NFL players from Harvard last year.\n\nYes, that Haaaarvard. Even when comparing to the other Ivies, that's an oddity. Yale had two. So did Princeton, Penn, and Brown. Cornell, one. Columbia and Dartmouth, none. Harvard, seven??? (And, if we take it back to the previous year, NINE!!!)\n\nIs there something in the water in Cambridge? Is the supposed best university in America attracting not only the best minds, but the best football players? What is this, the early 1900s? Are leather helmets still in vogue?\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick and his beard is definitely Harvard's best-known alum in the NFL. Kyle Juszczyk of the 49ers just scored a touchdown in the Super Bowl. And then there's Titans tight end Anthony Firkser, who went from being undrafted to a key contributor. In case football doesn't work out, his degree in applied mathematics probably will.\n\nBelieve it or not, this makes Firkser the second NFL Harvard Jew we've profiled, joining one from those early 1900s, Arnold Horween. So maybe not an outlier?",
