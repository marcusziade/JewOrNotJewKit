  "description": "Who doesn't love \"Apollo 13\", the true-life story of a daring space rescue? Tom Hanks! Kevin Bacon! Gary Sinese! (Whatever happened to Gary Sinese?) Clint Howard! Inanimate Carbon Rod! (We might be mixing our space rescues...)\n\nWell, there was one story which didn't make the movie. The story of Judith Love Cohen: Ballet dancer. Children's author. NASA engineer.\n\nAfter an oxygen tank explosion on Apollo, the astronauts were pretty much doomed. They were saved by using the lunar module and its Abort-Guidance System. Cohen worked on that system, and it was her solution on the day of the disaster that helped save the astronauts.\n\nCohen called in that solution from the hospital. On that fateful day, she was giving birth.\n\nTo Jack Black. Yes, THAT Jack Black.\n\nAt least, that's how the story goes. It's confirmed on Snopes and everything. Except... it's not exactly true. Black was born in 1969; Apollo 13 took off a year later. While it is true that Cohen's work on the Abort-Guidance System helped bring the astronauts home, and she did solve a problem from the hospital on the day she was giving birth to Jack, the two don't seem to be the same event.\n\nThat's why they didn't put it in the movie...",
