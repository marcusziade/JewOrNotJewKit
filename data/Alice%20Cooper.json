  "description": "There are lots of stereotypical Jewish careers: lawyers, dentists, hair band death metal rockers.\n\nSure it's not the first one you think of, but with Gene Simmons and David Lee Roth already out there, you could be forgiven for accidentally assigning an axe-carrying member of the hard rock retinue to the shul set.\n\nFor instance, Alice Cooper, the poor man's Ozzy Osbourne. He wears makeup like Simmons. He's been reduced to irrelevancy and VH1 specials like Roth. He's a perfect fit. But he's not Jewish.\n\nThough there's some scant evidence to the contrary (supposedly Cooper  claimed to have grown up Jewish in some long lost TV clip), his father was a church elder and he went to a Lutheran elementary school. Meh. As you can tell, we're not exactly weeping over the loss.\n\nBut we hope this serves as a lesson to you: despite all the evidence to the contrary, not everyone who spits blood on stage is Jewish.",
