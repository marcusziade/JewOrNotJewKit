  "description": "The Paralymic Games have been getting much greater exposure recently. It's truly inspiring to see disabled people achieve something that even able-bodied ones cannot accomplish. And none of that would be possible without Ludwig Guttmann and his vision.\n\nGuttmann, a Prussian-born doctor, got out of Germany prior to World War II. In Britain, he became in charge of that country's first unit for treatment of spinal injuries. But Guttmann wanted more for his patients. In 1948, with the war over, he organized the \"Stoke Mandeville Games for the Paralyzed\", an archery competition held in, well, Stoke Mandeville (not to be confused with Stoke-on-Trent). 14 men and two women participated.\n\nIn time, the event grew. In 1952, a Dutch team competed, so now they were named the \"International Stoke Mandeville Games\". In 1960, the competition moved from tiny Stoke to Rome. 400 athletes from 23 countries competed in eight sports. With time, these became known as the Paralympic Games.\n\nThe third edition was staged in Tel Aviv. The seventh, on Long Island, of all places. They are now held in conjunction with the Olympics, just like Guttmann envisioned. The last competition had over 4000 athletes from 162 countries.\n\nTruly inspiring.",
