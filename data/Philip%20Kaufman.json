  "description": "At the end of \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", it says: \"based on characters by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman\". Lucas, sure. Who the hell is Kaufman?\n\n(Apparently, it says so at the end of the other Indy films as well, we just never noticed it. Anyway...)\n\nKaufman was a pretty prominent film director in his own right, mostly active in the 1970s. His credits include \"The Wanderers\", \"The Right Stuff\", and \"Rising Sun\". And, yeah, Indiana Jones. Clearly most important of all!\n\nWhile the creation of Jones the character is credited to Lucas, Kaufman came up much of the plot of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". This included making the Ark of the Covenant into Indy's first MacGuffin. (Apparently, first suggested by Kaufman's dentist!?) In fact, Lucas wanted Kaufman to direct the movie, but he was too busy working on \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", so Steven Spielberg stepped in instead.\n\nClearly, that worked out for Indiana Jones and the franchise. Did it work out for Kaufman? Who knows, but we should have noticed him earlier!",
