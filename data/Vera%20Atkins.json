  "description": "You might have seen \"The Imitation Game\", the movie based on the true story of Alan Turing breaking the Nazi Enigma code. Turing is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, so that's how you know he is smart. He doesn't even need Dr. Watson's help or anything, he breaks the code all by himself.\n\nWhile we're not here to detract from Turing's (or even Cumberbatch's) awesomeness, let's just say that the movie left a few things out. The most glaring omission is that a lot of deciphering was the work of three Poles: Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki, and Henryk Zygalski.\n\nAnd then there is Vera Atkins, a Jewish British operative who led the team that evacuated the trio out of Poland. They made it out just six days before the Germans attacked. Atkins took the Poles into the country of her birth, Romania. From there, the trio made it further west, met Turning, and the rest is code-breaking history. Only you didn't see that on the silver screen.\n\nA dashing British spy, three geniuses, a daring escape? That would make a good movie, wouldn't it?",
