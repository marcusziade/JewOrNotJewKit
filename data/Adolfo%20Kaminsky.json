  "description": "Today, a letter in our mailbox from a reader in New York urges us to profile fewer \"obscure hockey players and old TV sitcom actors\" and more \"real heroes\". Well, dear reader, you're in luck!\n\nMax Kaminsky, a Jew from Niagara Falls, Canada, entered the NHL in 1933, and played...\n\nSigh. Here were go again. Obscure hockey players. Fine! Let's write about Adolfo Kaminsky instead.\n\nAdolfo Kaminsky was a forger. How does that make him a hero? Well, during World War II, Kaminsky, an Argentine-born Jew, was part of the French Resistance, where his skills were used to forge documents. By one count, he saved some 14,000 Jews. When Paris was liberated, he joined the French Army and made documents for its spies.\n\nAfter the war, Kaminsky stayed active in forgery, helping anti-authoritarian movements all over the world. He always worked for free, making sure he did it for the cause, not for the money. Tell us that's not a real hero!\n\nAdolfo's daughter, Sarah Kaminsky, wrote her father's biography. She is also an actor... We are not sure if she appeared in sitcoms.",
