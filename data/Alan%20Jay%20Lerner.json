  "description": "\"So prepare yourself for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of 'Paint Your Wagon'.\" — Bart Simpson\n\n\"With blood, I hope!\" — Homer Simpson\n\nSo begins a rather regrettable season 9 clip show episode of \"The Simpsons\". Bart and Homer sadly discover that \"Paint Your Wagon\" is a musical that contains very little blood... and we discover that \"Paint Your Wagon\" was an actual, real Broadway play, which was later made into a movie.\n\nThe not-so-classic was created by playwright and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner, with music by fellow landsman Frederick Loewe. Lerner was actually rather renowned: he won three Oscars (two for screenplays, one for song) and three Tonys. He created some of the industry's most famous musicals: \"Gigi\" and a little hit called \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nAs for \"Paint Your Wagon\"? From the NY Times review of the movie: \"Clint Eastwood sings like a moose.\"\n\n\"Singing is the lowest form of communication.\" — Homer Simpson\n\nWe don't disagree...",
