  "description": "Potential NFL draftees get asked all kinds of strange questions by talent evaluators. Here's a sampling:\n\n\"How many ways could you use a brick in a minute?\"\n\n\"Would you rather be a cat or a dog?\"\n\n\"If you could kill someone and not get caught, would you?\" \n\nThat got dark quickly. This year, Alabama wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was asked about the Star of David pendant around his neck.\n\nJeudy's response? Some people shorten his name to \"Jew\", so he wears it as a tribute. \"I'm not Jewish, though.\"\n\nJeudy was drafted 15th by the Denver Broncos, so we guess his answer was acceptable.\n\n\"Don't mean no disrespect to the Jewish people!\", Jeudy added.\n\nNone taken!",
