  "description": "There are some out there who criticize us when we give a high score and the Jew verdict to an atheist. Those are not real Jews, we are told. How dare we!\n\nIf it hasn't been made clear after nine years and 2100 profiles, this is how: not believing in G-d doesn't stop one from being a Jew. For instance, take Primo Levi, renowned chemist, best-selling author. Here's a quote:\n\n\"I too entered the lager as a nonbeliever, and as a nonbeliever I was liberated and have lived to this day.\" What is this \"lager\" he was talking about?\n\nAuschwitz.\n\nYes, Levi, scientist and writer, Levi, who took part in the Italian guerrilla movement, spent a year at Auschwitz. And, no, he didn't believe in G-d. Does that make him less of a Jew? What do you think, contentious readers?\n\nAnd, yes, a perfect Jew Score. We dare.",
