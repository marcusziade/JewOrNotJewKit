  "description": "Martin Scorsese really, really wanted to become a priest. He went to Catholic school. And seminary. And another Catholic school. And dreamed of attending Fordham, a Catholic university.\n\nBut something happened.\n\nYoung Martin discovered girls.\n\nSuch as a life of a Catholic priest: girls are just not an option. So, when Fordham did not accept him, Martin had to \"settle\" for NYU, where he fell in love with film... and with Laraine Brennan, an Irish Jew. (Yentappeal!)\n\nSoon, the two were married. Priesthood was now an afterthought. Laraine opened Martin's eyes, (quoting Les Keyser's biography of Scorsese) \"raising questions about religion, career versus domesticity, and severing connections to his past\". Out of that, one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time was born. Out of that, we got \"Taxi Driver\". And \"Raging Bull\". And \"Goodfellas\". And \"Gangs of New York\". And \"The Departed\".\n\nOh sure, the two divorced six years after. And sure, Scorsese's next four wives have all been goyishe. And sure, he'll always consider himself Catholic.\n\nBut where would he be without that yenta?",
