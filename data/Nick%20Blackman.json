  "description": "There are quite a few Jews who played in the English Premier League. It's just none of them are English. No, we're not counting a quarter of David Beckham. \n\nThat changed in 2013. The player's name was Nick Blackman, who was born in England, but has roots in the Netherlands, Poland, and Barbados. The Jewishness comes from his grandmother, who was taken in by a Jewish family during World War II and converted.\n\nSo, is Blackman a superb goalscorer? A stalwart defender? A budding superstar? Not exactly. Playing for Reading, Blackman, a striker, failed to score in his first season in the league... which ended with his club being relegated to the lower division.\n\nSo, once again, there are quite a few Jews in the English Premier League. It's just none of them are English.",
