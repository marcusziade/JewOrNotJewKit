  "description": "A while back, we lamented that Yakov Smirnoff is the face of Russian Jews in America. Well, we're about to change that.\n\nSure, the stench of Yakov's \"In Soviet Russia\" jokes will be hard to erase, but with the bearded comic stashed away in Missouri, it's time for a change.\n\nSo what if we're a bit late with Lenny Krayzelburg. In the Sydney Olympics in 2000, the Soviet-born swimmer won three golds for America. Four year later in Athens, he helped the US to another one.\n\nAnd in 2001, Krayzelburg skipped the World Championship in order to fulfill his childhood dream and participate in the Maccabiah Games. The result? Do you need to ask?\n\nSo take your balalaika and shove it, Smirnoff. We don't know what the deal with Soviet Russia was, but on this website, Krayzelburg out-Jews you.",
