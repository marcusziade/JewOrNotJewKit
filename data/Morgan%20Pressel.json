And sure, most of us Jews were never really interested in picking up your ridiculous sport. But you know what? We like a challenge. \n\nHow else do you explain the Jewish Morgan Pressel, who, at the age of 18, became the youngest woman ever to win a major tournament, taking the Kraft Nabisco Championship in 2007?\n\nAnd it won't end with Pressel, we assure you. Soon we'll conquer golf and then take over all your yuppie sports. We already have a gold medal in sailing. What's left? Polo? Saddle up!",
