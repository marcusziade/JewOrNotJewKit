No. No. No.\n\nSame goes for Wayne Gretzky, Pele, Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor, and Walter Payton.\n\nBasketball, golf, baseball, hockey, soccer, football. The greatest to play their respective sports and there's not a Jew among them.\n \nBut tennis? Tennis is a different story.\n\nBecause while Pete Sampras may only be 1/4 Jewish, that's more than enough for us. Who cares if he's never been to synagogue? His multiple trips to the winner's circle more than make up for it.\n\nTell your friends. A Jew is the Greatest Tennis Player Ever.\n\nWhat's that? Roger Federer? Never heard of him.",
