  "description": "Lots of famous people have been born on August 30th: Mary Shelley, Huey Long, Ted Williams, Warren Buffett, Cameron Diaz...  Heck, lots of famous Jews as well!\n\nFor example, Lithuanian Jewish painter Isaac Levitan was born on that day in 1860. Tennis player Vic Seixas, who won the Wimbledon and US Open, in 1923. 1946 gave us Peggy Lipton, the actress best known for \"The Mod Squad\". Two years later, comedian Lewis Black of \"The Daily Show\". Our favorite \"Hey, it's THAT guy!\", David Paymer, was born in 1954 (alright, we're stretching \"famous\" here).\n\nWhat else was born on August 30th? Well, our humble website! That's right, JewOrNotJew.com is turning eight years old!\n\nYes, eight years ago we posted our first two profiles: Charlie Chaplin and Vladimir Lenin. In fact, August 30th was rather memorable for Lenin as well: in 1918, he was shot on that day by Fanny Kaplan... Jew!\n\nWe're just celebrating the birthdays, natch.",
