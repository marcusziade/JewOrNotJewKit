  "description": "In Hollywood, it's always good to have friends. For example, because of his friendship with Jerry Seinfeld, Larry Miller was almost George Costanza.\n\nYes, that guy on the left. Larry Miller. Pretty funny comedian. Probably best known for Christopher Guest movies. Always plays smug assholes.\n\nHow close was he to becoming Costanza? It was supposed to be a given. When Jason Alexander saw that he was up against Miller, he didn't think he had a chance.\n\nBut Alexander's audition blew everyone away, and the rest is short, stocky, bald TV history. As for Miller, Seinfeld got him a role as well... as a smug asshole doorman in one episode.\n\nWhat are friends for?",
