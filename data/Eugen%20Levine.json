  "description": "Regular readers know about our recent fascination with the Bavarian Revolution. To recap:\n\nIn November 1918, the Wittelsbach monarchy is overthrown and the Free State of Bavaria is proclaimed. In charge is Kurt Eisner, Jew, who is gunned down by a nationalist in February 1919.\n\nThe assassination leads to the proclamation of the Bavarian Soviet Republic in April. In charge is anarchist playwright Ernst Toller, Jew. He lasts all of six days.\n\nNow the communists take over. Eugen Levin\ufffd, Jew, is running the show, and the days of anarchist incompetence are gone. Levin\ufffd gives control of factories to the workers, decides to move the homeless to opulent apartments, and even hatches a plan to outlaw money. Oh, and he executes a bunch of people. Can't be a communist revolution without that!\n\nLevin\ufffd's reign lasts less than a month. In May, the German army takes over Munich, the communists are deposed, and their leader is swiftly executed. Bavaria goes back to Germany, and we all know what happened after.\n\nPerhaps a Soviet Republic would have been a better alternative?",
