  "description": "Dear Jewish golf fans,\n\n(Wait a minute... are there Jewish golf fans? Let's assume there are.)\n\nWe know that you have been waiting for that Jewish golf champ for a while. Sure, there was Corey Pavin, but he decided to trade in his yarmulke for a cross... His loss, not ours, can we agree on that?\n\nWe know that every time someone with a pseudo-Jewish name rises up on Tour, you start hoping. For example, when Charl Schwartzel won the Masters a couple of years ago. Or every time that Spencer Levin creeps up the leader board.\n\nDear Jewish golf fans,\n\nLet it go. The odds of a Jewish golf champ are pretty darn low. Levin (sorry to get your hopes up) is not a Jew. The last name comes from a line of goyishe Swedes.\n\nSo what are you to do, Jewish golf fans?\n\nStart following tennis!\n\nOh, wait.",
