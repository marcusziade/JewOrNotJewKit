  "description": "If you google \"bar sinister\", you will get an array of various responses. There is Bar Sinister, \"LA's #1 UnderGround NightClub in HOLLYWOOD Gothic, Industrial, AlternatiVe sound EVERY SATURDAY\". Sounds like a happening place!\n\nThen there is the concept of \"bar sinister\", an incorrect way to refer to \"bend sinister\" on a coat of arms, a diagonal sash that represents illegitimacy. It can also mean someone born out of wedlock. A bastard, simply.\n\nAnd speaking of bastards, there is Simon Bar Sinister, the villain of Underdog cartoons from the 1960s. He is a mad scientist who is a parody of Lex Luthor, wants to take over the world (join the club!), and is always foiled by Underdog. Some wonder if he is Jewish because his name is a play on words of the heraldic bar sinister and... Jewish freedom fighter Simon bar Kokhba? (Let's use the Gargamel Law: Not a Jew.)\n\nNow, to get to the cartoon character, you first must get through various photos associated with the aforementioned nightclub...\n\nDon't google \"bar sinister\".",
