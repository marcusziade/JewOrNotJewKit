  "description": "\"All men are Jews, though few men know it.\" â€” Bernard Malamud\n\nWe are sorry, but we must disagree with Mr. Malamud, author of \"The Natural\" and one of the most esteemed Jewish American writers. We understand what he means in the broad sense, but... well, there are just a number of men who are NOT Jews, no matter how you choose to interpret the quote.\n\nWe can list a few, but it's easier to click on the \"List by Score\" link on the left and browse through the 0s, 1s, and 2s. Nope, no Jews there.\n\nBesides, if every man WAS Jewish, it would make our website a tad more irrelevant, wouldn't it?",
