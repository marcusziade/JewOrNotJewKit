  "description": "When we created this website, we needed to find someone who would represent the perfect Jew Score, the epicenter of our website. Our choice was Mel Brooks, and we couldn't be happier with it.\n\nAs time passed, we realized that we couldn't keep the perfect score to Brooks alone. So more and more were given out, to rather worthy recipients. It's the least we could do.\n\nBut does this mean that Brooks is still the epicenter of our website? Sure, he was the first perfect 15, but now the first of many.\n\nSo how about we calculate the epicenter a bit differently, by the number of \"See Also\" links you see at the bottom of each profile. Surely, the one who has the most links going back to them could be considered the epicenter?\n\nWould you believe that person is... Mel Brooks? Yes, no one has been referenced more than our original perfect profile. From his contemporaries to collaborators, we have them covered.\n\nOr so we thought. There is one rather important Brooks collaborator that we are missing: Madeline Kahn. The actress has appeared in a number of Brooks films, most memorably as Lili von Shtupp in \"Blazing Saddles\". Dubbed the Teutonic Titwillow in that movie, she was anything but in real life â€” Jewish on all counts.\n\nAnd yet another link back to Brooks. We couldn't be happier with it.",
