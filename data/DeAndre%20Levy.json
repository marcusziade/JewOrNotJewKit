  "description": "Cohen, Cohen, and Levy\n\nNo, not a law firm (although, odds are, somewhere a law firm). Cohen, Cohen, and Levy were teammates on the 2009 Detroit Lions.\n\nThose 2009 Lions are best known for NOT being the 2008 Lions, the only team to go an entire 16-game NFL season winless. Next year, they actually won two games, which was, believe it or not, seen as success. And that year's underwhelming Lions defense featured... yes, Cohen, Cohen, and Levy.\n\nCohen #1 is Landon Cohen. He played six nondescript years for various teams, appearing in the 2015 Super Bowl for the Seahawks in a losing effort. There is no evidence that he is a Jew.\n\nCohen #2 is Joe Cohen. His NFL career consisted of nine games, all during that 2009 Lions season. There is no evidence that he is a Jew.\n\nLevy is DeAndre Levy, clearly the best known of the three. A rookie in 2009, he had a very productive career before succumbing to injuries. He also had a nice beard, and is somehow NOT the first person named DeAndre we've profiled. Jew? Well, he is not a lawyer...",
