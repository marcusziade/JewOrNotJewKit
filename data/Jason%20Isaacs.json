  "description": "We've had a big argument at JONJ Headquarters recently. It had to do with the quality of the Harry Potter films.\n\nYou see, the staff at JONJ is usually on the same page as far as movies are concerned. Our average argument is \"Star Wars: great trilogy or the greatest trilogy?\". But in this case, there is a clear dichotomy.\n\nNow, to say that we love the Harry Potter BOOKS is an understatement. We adore them. We treasure every single page. But the movies?\n\nTo one of us, the movies are an excellent complement to the books. No, they don't rival their greatness, but they are fun, enjoyable, and serve as a reminder to how wonderful the books are. To the other one, the movies are superfluous, unnecessary, a pale imitation, and serve as a reminder of how wonderful the books are â€” in comparison to how poor the movies.\n\nSo, when it came time to profile Jewish actor Jason Isaacs, do we praise him for his work as Voldemort sidekick Lucious Malfoy, or do we dismiss it as a blemish on an otherwise respectable career?\n\nWell, it depends on who is writing this profile, right?",
