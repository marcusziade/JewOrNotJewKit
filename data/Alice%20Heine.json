  "description": "Everyone knows the story of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III of Monaco. It's a fairy tale come to life: Hollywood actress, European royalty, true love... Etc, etc, etc.\n\nWell, before Grace Kelly, there was Alice Heine. Like Grace, she was an American. Unlike Grace, she was Jewish. Somewhat.\n\nAlice's father was Michael Heine, a Jewish French banker (she is also related to previously profiled Jewish German poet Heinrich Heine). Before Alice's birth, her family moved to New Orleans. Alas, she was baptized Catholic.\n\nThe family moved back to France due to the American Civil War, where Alice met her first husband, the Duke of Richelieu. The Duke died in 1880, so Alice moved up in title, marrying the Prince of Monaco, Albert I. They did not have any children, as Monaco's royal lines continued through the son of Albert's first, completely goyishe wife.\n\nThis tale does not have a happy ending: Albert and Alice separated after twelve years of marriage.\n\nThey can't all be Grace Kelly...",
