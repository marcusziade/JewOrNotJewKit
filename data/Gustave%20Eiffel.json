  "description": "On Bastille Day this year, Israeli President Shimon Peres visited the French embassy. There he made a speech, in which he made a point that the symbol of France, the Eiffel Tower, was the work of a Jew, Gustave Eiffel.\n\nD'oh!\n\nQuite a faux pas for Mr. Peres, but perhaps it's our fault as well. Everyone in the world knows that this website is the place to find out if people are Jewish, but we didn't have a Eiffel profile. Mr. Peres must have looked elsewhere.\n\nWe certainly hope his information did not come from a 19th century hate-filled screed titled \"The Jewish Question\", which claimed that Eiffel was \"nothing more or less than a German Jew.\" As it turns out, the architect had to defend the allegations, stating that \"I am neither Jewish nor German. I was born in France in Dijon of French Catholic parents.\"\n\nSo here you go, Mr. Peres. Next time you'll know not to make such a mistake.\n\nWhat, you also said that Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, the man behind the Statue of Liberty, was Jewish as well?\n\nOh boy.",
