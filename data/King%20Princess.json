Confused much?\n\nRising recording start Mikaela Straus is, in fact, Jewish. One of her great-greatparents was former US Congressman Isidor Strauss, who owned Macy's and perished on the Titanic. She is also a king... and a princess, but not the hereditary kind. (Unless you consider the elder Straus New York Jewish royalty, but that's REALLY stretching it.)\n\nTo her fans, Straus is known as King Princess. For those curious, Mikaela is genderqueer, so she picked a name that encompasses both her sides. Sometimes she is a king, sometimes she is a princess. Makes sense?\n\nNothing good has ever come from arguing with a king... or a princess.",
