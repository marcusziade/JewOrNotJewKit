  "description": "In history of warfare, there have been thousands of battles between armies on horses.\n\nThere have been hundreds of battles between armies on tanks or airplanes.\n\nThere has only been one battle between armies on helicopters.\n\nIt came in the middle of the Cold War. One side was supplied by the Americans, and flew AH-1J SeaCobras, designed and manufactured in the US. The other was supplied by the Russians, and flew Mil Mi-25s, designed and manufactured in the USSR. Designed by Mikhail Mil, Jew, who was responsible for a multitude of Soviet helicopter models.\n\nThe winner? Mil's Mils, who took down ten SeaCobras, compared to six for the other side.\n\nThe country that used Jewish engineer's brilliance to win the battle? Iraq. Over Iran.\n\nOh.",
