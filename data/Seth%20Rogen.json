  "description": "Let's say, hypothetically, that there is more than one person who writes for this website. And, purely for the sake of argument, let's say that one of these hypothetical writers has been told he resembles the young, talented Jew pictured here.\n\nShould this person be insulted?\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with Seth Rogen. Certainly, in our purely hypothetical scenario, one would feel good about being compared to Rogen as, say, a writer, or actor, or just as an all-around good Jew.\n\nBut to look like him? And have it said in a way that is meant to be a compliment? We suppose there are worse comparisons. Like being told you look like the fat guy from ER, or the guy with glasses in the Barenaked Ladies. To pick two completely made up examples of what one might have been told one looks like.\n\nSo we're more than happy to have Seth as a fellow Jew, and we hope he continues to be involved in movies as outright hilarious as \"40-Year Old Virgin\" and \"Knocked Up\".\n\nBut being told you look like him? By a member of the opposite sex? That's just too painful to bear.\n\nHypothetically, of course.",
