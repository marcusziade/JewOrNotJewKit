  "description": "Throughout the years, we've profiled the greatest ever Jewish football player (Sid Luckman), baseball player (Sandy Koufax), basketball player (Dolph Schayes), soccer player (1/4 of David Beckham), and even hockey player (we'll leave you in suspense). But who is the greatest ever Jewish... cyclist?\n\nBet you didn't see that one coming! In fact, the only Jewish cyclist we've ever profiled was Adolf Schmal, who competed in the Olympics all the way back in 1896. Gold medal in the endurance race or not, we probably can't consider him the greatest ever. Then who?\n\nLet's just say that we don't have too many choices here. No Jew has ever come close to winning the Tour de France or an Olympic medal since the times of Schmal. But one Jew did become world champion: Latvia's Romans Vainsteins, who won the World Road Race title in 2000.\n\nVainsteins wasn't exactly a superstar; his best Tour finish was 83rd. After his surprising world championship, he moved to Italy, got fat, and soon quit competing. And yet, he is probably the greatest Jewish cyclist ever... by default.\n\nGreatest Jewish golfer?
