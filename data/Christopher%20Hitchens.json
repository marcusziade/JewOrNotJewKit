  "description": "There are some topics that always get us in trouble. Christianity, for instance. Every time we poke fun at the goyim and their silly religious traditions, we get a bunch of emails saying how stupid we are. But think about it, goyim. You're the ones eating wafers pretending it's the body of Jesus. Who is stupid now?\n\nBut even worse is the topic of anti-Zionism. Here, we can't win, no matter what we write. If we praise an anti-Zionist for something else they've done, we get bashed. And if we deride one for, well, being an anti-Zionist, we get accused of closed-mindedness. So... So:\n\nChristopher Hitchens:\n\nRaised Anglican\nBecame atheist\nAnti-Zionist\nHalf-Jewish\nNow dead\n\nThat is all.",
