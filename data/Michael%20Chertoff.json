  "description": "Netflix's recent documentary about the downfall of the mafia in New York City in the 1980s was not exactly eye-opening... especially if you happened to live in the area. Still, it was interesting to hear how the FBI surveilled the Five Families to bring them to justice. Let's just say that Italians tend to be chatty.\n\nA couple of thing did catch our attention. Back when he was US District Attorney, Rudy Giuliani was far from the bozo he is today. The man actually worked to bring down oligarchs, not embolden them.\n\nThe other was Michael Chertoff, who is best known as the second ever Secretary of Homeland Security and the co-author of the Patriot Act. Back in the 80s, Chertoff (son of a rabbi!) used to work for Giuliani and played a huge role in marginalizing the mafia. Oh, and he used to look like this.\n\nSomewhat eye-opening?\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('m/michael_chertoff', 'chertoff');\n}",
