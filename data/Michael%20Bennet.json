  "description": "Michael Bennet is a senator from Colorado, currently trying to run for US President. \"Trying\" is the key word here, as he is polling towards the bottom of the crowded Democratic field. You probably wouldn't be able to pick him out of a lineup, so take a gander at a photo to the left. Yep, a memorable face that is not.\n\nWell, that forgettable face is an Indian Jew. No joke! (By Indian, we mean Asian Indian, not Native American Indian. Still no joke!)\n\nAlright, Bennet doesn't have any Indian ancestry, so some might frown on him being called Indian. But he was born in New Delhi, where his father was an ambassador's aide, so we'll leave the verdict to IndianOrNotIndian.com. As for the Jewish part, even though Bennet is not religious, his mother is a Holocaust survivor. Bennet is proud of both his Jewish and Christian heritage, for all that's worth.\n\nMaybe if the American public knew about Bennet's diverse background, they would be more welcoming of his candidacy?\n\nIncredibly unlikely.",
