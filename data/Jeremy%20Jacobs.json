  "description": "Despite the Boston Bruins winning the Stanley Cup in the last decade, their fans are not exactly fans of team owner Jeremy Jacobs. He is, in a word... cheap.\n\nFor years, Jacobs ran the team on a shoestring budget, doing just enough to keep the fans' interest while stopping the team short from being a contender. While that recently changed with the aforementioned title, there are still a number of black marks on his ledger.\n\nFor one, Jacobs was the owners' leader in NHL's recent work stoppages. This is a man who bought the team for $10 million back in 1975... That team is worth $890 million now (a tidy profit of 8800%), and yet, he cried poverty. At the end, he won; the owners got pretty much what they asked for, yet another case of rich getting richer.\n\nIt's not just hockey fans who have a beef with Jacobs. He made his money in concessions; his company still furbishes many arenas and stadiums throughout the country, gouging sports fans and concert goers while providing questionable service and quality.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't mention that he is part Jewish?",
