  "description": "Woody Allen sure likes his shiksas. From real life (Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow... let's stop here), to his films (Keaton again, Mariel Hemingway, Farrow again, Judy Davis, Mira Sorvino, Radha Mitchell, etc, etc, etc).\n\n(There are two clear exceptions here. One is Louise Lasser, who Allen was briefly married to â€” the key word here is \"briefly\". The other is Scarlett Johansson, but we're gonna let that one slide: she's only half Jewish, and she's Scarlett Johansson... how can Woody NOT be mesmerized?)\n\nMoving on to \"Whatever Works\", Allen's latest film, where the Woody role is played by Larry David, who meets a young woman (Woody and his young women... let's stop here), a runaway from Mississippi, played by Evan Rachel Wood, another one in the line of fine Woody shiksas...\n\nOr not, for her movie Southern accent aside (and Wood was born in North Carolina), in real life Evan is... Jewish (her father is Christian, but her mother converted to Judaism).\n\nHmmmm. Perhaps Woody's shiksappeal is slipping at his advanced age?\n\nOr not. Just look at his current... (All right! We'll stop right here!)",
