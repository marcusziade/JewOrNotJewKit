  "description": "We want to write about the very wonderful, rather Jewy Pamela Adlon, and her very wonderful, rather Jewy show, \"Better Things\", but we keep thinking about Louis CK. But making this about Louis CK is not exactly fair to Miss Adlon, so...\n\nSo, there clearly would not be \"Better Things\" without Louis. Adlon has had a long career in Hollywood, starting as a child actress in the 80s, doing a lot of voice work (she was Bobby on \"King of the Hill\"), but never exactly rising to the A-List. It was her collaboration with Louis, first on his short-lived HBO sitcom, then on his eponymous, critically-acclaimed FX show, that gave her an opportunity to do her own thing. And that, \"Better\" thing, was co-created (and, through its first two seasons, co-written) by Louis, which...\n\nWhich, to put it bluntly, gets pretty complicated. Back in 2017, Louis came clean about years of sexually harassing female coworkers. His despicable actions hurt the lives of many. Louis has been on a rehabilitation tour as of late, so some are willing to forgive and forget. There is also that thing of separating the artist from the art, but...\n\nBut, yeah, it's not that simple. Let's just say that we're incredibly glad that Adlon was able to show her talent, and that the seasons of \"Better Things\" she created without Louis are at least as good, often better, than the ones with his involvement.\n\nWe hope that's fair to her.",
