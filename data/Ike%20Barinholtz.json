  "description": "The recent Apple TV murder mystery show \"The Afterparty\" presents our own personal hell. No, not murder.\n\nHigh school reunion. Don't get us started.\n\nThat being said, it's a rather watchable show with a VERY Jewy cast (Dave Franco, Tiffany Haddish, Ben Schwartz, Ilana Glazer, Ike Barinholtz) and one major problem: Barinholtz.\n\nWhen casting a show about high school reunion, it's important that all actors at that reunion are of a similar age. In \"The Afterparty\", they are all supposed to be in their early 30s. Most of them are (well, most are in some kind of 30s), with one clear exception: Barinholtz. He is 44, sticking out like a sore thumb. A sore, wrinkly thumb that no amount of makeup is able to conceal.\n\nPerhaps it's just a commentary that some people age much faster than others? Perhaps if we want to our own high school reunion, it's the exact phenomena we would observe?\n\nWe'd rather deal with murder.",
