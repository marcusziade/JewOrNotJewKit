  "description": "You might have heard.\n\nGeneralissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.\n\nHas been so for over 35 years. A pity, really. No, not because Spain has been dictator-free since his passing. But because we'll never be able to figure out if the Jewish rumors were true.\n\nFranco's relationship with Jews during World War II has been scrutinized at length. He did compile a list of Jews and sent it to Himmler. However, unlikely his Nazi counterparts, Spain had no concentration camps and actually welcomed Jewish refugees. So why did Franco stand apart from his allies?\n\nBecause, as some suggested, he might have been Jewish.\n\nNow, in life Franco was clearly a Catholic. But some believe that he was a descendant of marranos. Some go further, saying his mother was Jewish, for her last name (Bahamonde) is supposed to be a Jewish one.\n\nIt's likely all hogwash, but then again, who is to know for sure? Well, Generalissimo Francisco Franco did. But now he is dead.\n\nYou might have heard.",
