  "description": "\"Saban is Jesus. Bear is God. Finebaum is the Holy Spirit.\" — Cecil Hurt, Alabama sportswriter\n\n(Nick) Saban is the current head football coach at Alabama. (Bear) Bryant is his legendary predecessor. (Paul) Finebaum? He is a sports radio host who specializes in Alabama football.\n\n\"I don't think you can function in the Southeast and not know who Paul is.\" — Nick Saban\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, Finebaum is so popular, that a quarter of its (male) population tunes in to his show. That is echoed throughout the state and the region.\n\n\"Has Paul told you how he won me the election?\" — Robert Bentley\n\nBentley is the current Governor of Alabama. He claims that going on Finebaum's show and telling tales of Bryant helped him win the state.\n\n\"It's the Gospel because Finebaum said it.\" — Charles Barkley, Alabama native\n\nWe wonder how many of Finebaum's listeners know he is Jewish?",
