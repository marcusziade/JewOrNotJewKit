  "description": "How is this for a love story?\n\nGerty Radnitz and Carl Cori are young scientists. They have so much in common! They love doing sciency things together... \n\nOne thing stands in their way: Carl is Catholic. Gerty is Jewish. Being a Jew in 1920 Prague is no picnic! Besides, Carl thinks that having a Jewish wife will stand in his way of climbing the scientific ladder... And his family is not exactly a fan. So what does Gerty do? She converts.\n\nThe love story continues. They continue working together, move to Buffalo, become American citizens, move to Missouri... Together, they win the Nobel in Medicine in 1947, becoming one of the rare couples to share one! It truly is a love story for the ages.\n\nYou can tell which part of this story we don't exactly... love.",
