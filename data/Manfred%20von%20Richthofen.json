  "description": "Don't get us wrong, we have nothing against Germany per se. In fact, if you love pretzels and beer, Germany might be right up your alley. It's just that... Jews and Germans don't mix very well. And that's an understatement.\n\nSo when we found out that there were over 130 Jewish airmen, pilots, and gunners who flew for Germany in World War I, we were a little set back. Granted, this is World War I, not II. But imagining Jews flying and fighting for the Fatherland... Das Vaterland? \n\nOy gevalt.\n\nAnd it turns out that the famed \"Red Baron\", Manfred von Richthofen, was rumored to be Jewish. Whether or not that was true, we might never know. But there's something to be said about the possibility of Germany's greatest military hero being a Jew.\n\nAs unbelievable as that seems.",
