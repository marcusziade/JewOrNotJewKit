  "description": "Perhaps we looked in the wrong place for a memorable Jewish fictional character. We plowed through the classics. We skimmed through the contemporaries. Shylock, Fagin, Bloom. Greedy, evil, boring. Bleh, bleh, bleh.\n\nWho knew that cartoons were the answer? For it doesn't get more memorable and more Jewish than Kyle Broflovski from \"South Park\". The only Jewish kid in town.\n\nWhen his friends fall for \"The Passion of the Christ\", who is the voice of conscience? Kyle. When evil Eric Cartman makes fun of Jews, who stands up to him? Kyle. When Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo visits, who does he talk to? Kyle.\n\nAnd Kyle has that patented Jew angst down, constantly questioning the validity of his beliefs. He even resents his Jewfro, forever hidden under his winter hat.\n\nBut Kyle always comes around. He has to. He is the only Jewish kid in town.",
