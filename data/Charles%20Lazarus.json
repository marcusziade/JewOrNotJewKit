  "description": "On March 22, 2018, Charles Lazarus kicked the bucket. He was 94. Time to go, we guess.\n\nOn March 23, 2018, Toys \"R\" Us began to liquidate its stores. It was 70. Time to go, we guess?\n\nOh, the cries could be heard throughout America. How dare they close Toys \"R\" Us!? That's where childhood dreams were made! That's where a kid can be a kid! (That's where a kid can whine and beg their parents for the latest Nintendo game. WE DO NOT SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE!)\n\nThat's where a kid can be a... consumer. Seriously, we're not shedding a tear about the closure of this mecca of American pseudo-opulence. Good riddance! (Of course, they probably lucked out that they started to liquidate in 2018. There is absolutely no way that store would have survived the pandemic.)\n\nToys \"R\" Us has been sort of resurrected in a zombie state; you can find it in some Macy's. Unlike his biblical namesake, Lazarus, of course, is still dead.\n\nIn what must have been a colossal coincidence, Lazarus was the Toys \"R\" Us founder.",
