  "description": "We could never understand why the US government can't just get rid of the penny. After all, it costs more than a cent to make it.\n\nWill getting rid of it create many problems? Maybe initially, but not in the long run. Stores can just round everything to the nearest five cents. Who pays with pennies anyway? Kids who empty out their piggy banks? They'd just have to do with nickels.\n\nWill anyone even miss the penny? Old ladies who yearn for time lost? Lincoln aficionados? Descendants of Victor David Brenner? Who?\n\nVictor David Brenner, a Lithuanian-born sculptor, is the man responsible for the design of the Lincoln penny. In fact, if you look closely at the bottom left, you will see the initials of VDB etched into Abe's shoulder.\n\nSo, since Brenner was Jewish, will we reverse our stance on the penny?\n\nNah.",
