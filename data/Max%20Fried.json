  "description": "54 years ago, Sandy Koufax did not pitch on Yom Kippur. The story has entered Jewish American folklore and gets repeated every year during baseball playoffs. Is a game scheduled on Yom Kippur? Are Jewish players involved? Will they follow in Koufax's footsteps, or... you know?\n\nIt's pretty much always \"you know\".\n\nWe're not here to judge; who is to say that a centuries-old tradition should take precedence over your everyday job, your teammates, and fans? What makes Judaism great is it leaves much to interpretation; the rules, although rigid, allow for flexibility. For example, you can have a snack in the middle of Yom Kippur if you are sick (Or if your stomach is growling? Asking for a friend!). At least that's our understanding...\n\nIn any case, this year, Max Fried decided to \"you know\" it for the Atlanta Braves, and promptly got shellacked as his team got blown out in game 5, losing the series to the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nPerhaps he should have followed Koufax...\n\n(Editor's update, November 2, 2021: Two years later, Fried won the decisive World Series game for the Braves. Yom Kippur was not in the equation.)",
