  "description": "Ryan O'Neal tried to pick up his own daughter at a funeral.\n\nIt wasn't just some funeral: O'Neal was laying to rest Farrah Fawcett, the love of his life. And it wasn't just some daughter: Tatum O'Neal, the youngest Oscar winner ever, recovering drug addict. The two have been estranged for years, so Ryan didn't recognized her. Or so he claims.\n\nMaybe if Tatum was closer to her father, she wouldn't have made a rather glaring mistake in her autobiography. She claimed that Ryan's maternal grandmother was a Russian Jew named Devonovitch. Tatum was mostly off the mark: the grandmother was a German Jew named Pius. But at least she got the most important part right.\n\nThat's right, Ryan O'Neal, America's former heartthrob, himself a recovering drug addict, is Halachically Jewish. Maybe he could finally clear that up for Tatum.\n\nOf course, figuring out the source of the family's Jewishness is the least of their problems...",
