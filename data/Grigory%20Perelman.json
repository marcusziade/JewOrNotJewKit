  "description": "Grigory Perelman has been called the smartest man in the world. The Russian Jewish mathematician proved the previously-thought-unsolvable Poincare Conjecture, which basically states that any three-dimensional space without holes is a sphere. His proof might help determine the shape of the universe. Yeah, it's a big deal.\n\nFor his work, Perelman was awarded the top honor of mathematics, the Fields Medal, as well as the Millennium Prize, a one-million-dollar award for solving one of seven mind-shattering problems (the other six remain unsolved).\n\nPerelman declined both awards.\n\nInstead, he quit mathematics altogether, and moved  into a barren, cockroach-infested apartment with his mother. \"I'm not interested in money or fame. I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo,\" Perelman said.\n\nNow, we're not gonna argue with Perelman's wishes. After all, what mathematician hasn't felt like they were caged for the entertainment of others? Just the paparazzi alone drives many a calculating prodigy over the edge. But come on, Grigory. You moved in with your mother. The least you could do is help her out. What kind of a Jewish son are you?\n\nSeriously, is the smartest man in the world also the stupidest?",
