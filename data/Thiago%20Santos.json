  "description": "Thiago \"The Sledgehammer\" Santos, a #1 ranked mixed martial artist from Brazil, has a Star of David tattoo. There, you can see it in his profile photo.\n\nIs he?... No. No, no, no.\n\nThiago is far from being the first goyishe athlete we had to profile because of his infatuation with the Magen David. Be it tattoos (soccer player Bernard, football player Terrell Suggs), jewelry (baseball player Dave Parker, football player Jerry Jeudy), or just insignia (race car driver Rubens Barrichello), for some reason, some of these goys just love Jewish symbolism!\n\nEnough is enough, goyishe sportsmen! How about we make you a deal: you will forego your Jewish insignia, and no Jew (athlete or otherwise) will ever, ever, EVER tattoo themselves with a cross!\n\nA Jew getting a cross tattoo does sound ridiculous, doesn't it?",
