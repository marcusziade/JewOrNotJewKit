  "description": "If you've seen \"An American Tail\" (and if you were born before 1985, you have. Trust us.), you know the question of Fievel's Judaism seems hardly worth the discussion. \n\nHis family flees Russia to escape the pogroms (instigated by cats, of course), then moves to the Lower East Side of New York to start a new life. Heck, the movie opens on Chanukah with Fievel getting his signature hat as a gift before lighting candles. This mouse is a Jew!  \n\nBut apparently, even all this was too subtle for the marketing wizards at McDonald's who took one look at our little murine mensch and dropped him into their Christmas campaign for 1986. \n\nGevalt!\n\nFievel on Christmas tree ornaments. Fievel dancing by the tree. Even Fievel in recut scenes from the movie that make it look like he has abandoned his faith for a more Sant-acular holiday. It's all just too much to bear (er, mouse).\n\nWe finally get a prominent animated Jewish hero and he's converted by industrial fiat. Typical. What's next, King David's Rockin' Easter? \n\nSeriously, McDonald's, it's not like there aren't scores of goyishe rodents to choose from. You had to take ours?",
