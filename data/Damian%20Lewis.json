You're talking about some TV show you were watching...\n\nWell, duh.\n\nAnd then you're gonna nitpick at it...\n\nWe're known to do that.\n\nAnd then you'll end up saying \"Ha! Look! So-and-so is Jewish!\" You consider this a profile?\n\nNot exactly...\n\nYou actually thought someone woke up this morning, went to Jew or Not Jew, and thought, oh boy! Let me hear their thoughts about \"Homeland\"!\n\nWell...\n\nWell what? \"Homeland\" is a terrific show!\n\nWe never said it wasn't... In fact, we quite like it, especially the first two seasons...\n\nOh, but the seasons that follow don't do it for you? You're getting predictable, Jew or Not Jew!\n\nCut us some slack, will you? Clearly, from season 3 on, it went off the rails... kinda like Carrie off her meds...\n\nEnough! Just end this already!\n\nDamian Lewis is 1/16 Jewish!\n\nWhoa! That's a surprise!",
