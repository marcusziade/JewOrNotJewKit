  "description": "You know what's so stupid about Russia's war in Ukraine? Well, many, many things, but one of them is Russia's claims that it's liberating Russian speakers.\n\nAs! If! While it's true that a large percentage of people who live in Eastern Ukraine are ethnically Russian, the matter of fact is, no one ever cared that they speak Russian. (There is always a subset of bigots; hell, look at THIS country.) The cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk, Odesa, the ones Russians are attacking: predominantly Russian-speaking. The people they are killing: predominantly Russian-speakers.\n\nTake a look at soccer player Andriy Voronin. \"My father is Russian, my mother is Jewish, and I became Ukrainian!\" Voronin was born in Odesa and is definitely Russian-speaking. He spent a part of his playing career, one that included playing for Ukraine at the 2006 World Cup, at Russian club Dynamo Moscow. He even became a coach at Dynamo after he retired.\n\nAs soon as Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, Voronin got out. Here's someone who could have firmly been called an Ukrainian Russiaphile that no longer wants anything to do with his heritage.  \"I do not see any possibility of staying in a country [Russia] whose army destroys our [Ukrainian] cities and fires at civilians.\"\n\nFucking Russia...",
