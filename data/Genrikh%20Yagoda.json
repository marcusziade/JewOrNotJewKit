  "description": "A couple of years ago, we dabbled in finding the worst Jew ever and settled on Chunk from \"The Goonies\". Har-har.\n\nBut, jokes aside, who really was the WORST JEW EVER?\n\nPresenting Genrikh Yagoda, the head of NKVD (KGB's predecessor) in the 1930s.\n\nPrior to heading NKVD, Yagoda was in charge of building two major canals. The work successfully completed and Yagoda was lauded. Tens of thousands died during construction.\n\nSo Yagoda got promoted, and got the whole country under his watch. In charge of Soviet law enforcement, he had hundreds of thousands  arrested, sent to gulags, and killed. Looks like Yagoda is in the running for the title, no?\n\nIt didn't end well for him, either. In 1936, Stalin decided he needed a change. Yagoda was replaced, arrested, and executed, joining the fate of ones he condemned.\n\nSo, worst Jew ever? Perhaps not! Yagoda chose to convert to Christianity before the communist takeover.\n\nSo are we back to Chunk from \"The Goonies\"?",
