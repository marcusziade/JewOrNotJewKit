  "description": "There are goyim named Abraham and Moses. We've lost our hold on Eli and Isaac. Levi, Herschel, Ruben... They are all gone.\n\nBut we've still got Chaim. We'll always have Chaim. For, we're willing to bet, no goy would ever give their child that name. A hard CH? It's not happening.\n\nBut what's this? The name is gaining in popularity? It is now in the top 1000 in the United States and steadily climbing? There were over 200 Chaims born in America last year? Those were all Jews... Right? Right?\n\nPlease? Pretty please? Can we still have Chaim?\n\nBut anyway, Chaim Soutine. Belarussian-born, French expressionist painter. Jew, of course.",
