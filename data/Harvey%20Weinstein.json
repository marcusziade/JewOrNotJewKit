  "description": "Remember when Harvey Weinstein's biggest crime was getting \"Shakespeare in Love\" the Best Picture Oscar?\n\nYou remember \"Shakespeare in Love\"? The perfectly middling dramedy about... well, Shakespeare. In love! Gwyneth Paltrow was involved. It was up for best picture against \"Saving Private Ryan\", a cinematic masterpiece. And yet, Shakespeare somehow won...\n\nIt won because Weinstein (an angry, aggressive, and insufferable bully), then in charge of Miramax, led a campaign that swept through Hollywood and earned Shakespeare the upset victory. In retrospect, that movie became one of the most absurd Best Picture winners in history. (It's not \"Dances with Wolves\" over \"Goodfellas\", but it's up there.)\n\nSo... remember those days? Today, Weinstein wishes that he was only referred to as \"angry, aggressive, and insufferable\".\n\nAbhorrent. Appalling. Atrocious. Creepy. Disgusting. Hideous. Horrible. Repugnant. Shameful.\n\n\"Sadly, a Jew\" doesn't do him justice.",
