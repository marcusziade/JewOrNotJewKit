  "description": "How well do you know the Biblical story of Onan? It's right there in Genesis, after Joseph's abduction. Doesn't ring a bell? Well, let us tell the tale...\n\nJoseph's older brother Judah had three sons. We are concerned with the oldest two, Er and Onan. Er married a local woman named Tamar. So far so good.\n\nEr was wicked, so G-d killed him. This rapidly took a turn for the worse.\n\nJudah was left with a windowed daughter-in-law. Being a pragmatist, he quickly came up with a solution: she should marry Onan. That must have been one awkward reception.\n\nUnfortunately for Onan, the marriage came with a caveat: since Er was the first-born, the first male child born to Tamar would inherit Judah's wealth. Onan would be left with bupkis. So he came up with an ingenious plan.\n\nIs this a family website? Well, this is all in the Bible, we're just rehashing it, so here goes. Every time Onan had sex with Tamar, he pulled out. Onan invented contraception.\n\nG-d would have none of that, and killed Onan. The end.\n\nWell, not really the end. The \"sin of Onan\" became a rule that does not allow sex for any reason other than procreation in various fundamentalist Judaeo-Christian sects.\n\nPerhaps Onan had the last laugh: the word \"onanism\" exists in many languages as a synonym for...\n\nDid we say this was a family website?",
