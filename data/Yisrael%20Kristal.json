  "description": "Quick! We need to profile Yisrael Kristal!\n\nWhy? A few days ago, we didn't even know about his existence.\n\nKristal is now the world's oldest man! He was born all the way back in 1903, making him 112 years young!\n\nAnd he's Jewish?\n\nWith a name like Yisrael? Kristal is actually a Holocaust survivor, and a devout Jew!\n\nSo why do we need to profile him so quickly?\n\nWell, to put it bluntly, by the time this profile runs, we need to make sure Kristal is still there to hold that oldest man alive title...\n\n(Editor's update, August 11, 2017: RIP, Yisrael.)",
