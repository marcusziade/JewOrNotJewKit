  "description": "Jewish mothers might come in all shapes in sizes, but they all agree on one thing:\n\nTheir children don't eat well enough.\n\nWhat Jewish mother (and, quite often, grandmother) hasn't stood over her child (grandchild) and asked them to eat just one more bite... just one more spoon. It's farina, mom (grandma)! If it's so delicious, why have I never seen YOU eat it?\n\nAnd while most Jewish children try to resist their mothers and, as a result, grow up quite svelte (and, by extension, healthy), some embrace the eating. Oh, do they ever. Take Adam Richman, the host of Travel Channel's \"Man vs. Food\". Now, Adam might not be obese, but he is getting there: every week he takes on various food challenges, where the goal is to eat something ginormous. Like an 72-ounce steak. Or the biggest pizza ever made. Or an 80-ounce steak. You get the picture.\n\nIt's a heart attack waiting to happen. Is that what you have wanted for us, mom (grandma)? Really?",
