  "description": "There is a lot of original stuff on Netflix. Most of it is... meh.\n\nSure, there are some good movies and series here and there, but overall it's not exactly thrilling. Of course, that seems to be Netflix's model: throw lots of feces at the wall and hope some sticks.\n\nDifferent types of feces will stick for different people. Take Adam Sandler movies, for instance. While not exactly our cup of tea, to a certain subset of the population they are perfect fodder for \"Netflix and chill\".\n\nOr take \"The Meyerowitz Stories\", starring Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, and (why, yes!) Adam Sandler. Director Noah Baumbach's work might not appeal to a large percentage of the population, but some (let's just say it: Jews!) might find it endearing.\n\nSo, what did we think of the \"The Meyerowitz Stories\"?\n\nMeh.",
