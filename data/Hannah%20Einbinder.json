  "description": "Jean Smart, who is enjoying a career resurgence, just won an Emmy for her role in \"Hacks\" as Deborah Vance, a Joan Rivers-like comedienne (enjoying a career resurgence?). And we got a couple of bones to pick with that.\n\nNo, not with Smart's performance, which was sublime. No, not with Smart's competition. Well, sort of with Smart's competition.\n\nWhy was her co-star Hannah Einbinder bumped down to best SUPPORTING actress category? If anything, Einbinder's Ava is the show's protagonist, and Smart's Deborah is the one supporting her! (Since it's impossible to write about Einbinder without mentioning that her mother is SNL original Laraine Newman, here you go.)\n\nThe second bone is with the award itself. (To spell it all out, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.) \"Hacks\" might be a show about two comediennes, but...\n\nIt's just not a comedy.",
