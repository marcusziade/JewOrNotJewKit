  "description": "You know what we love retelling at Jew or Not Jew? Love stories! We're just saps for romance...\n\nToday's subject is Arthur Rubinstein, widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. And the love story we're going to retell is of him and Nela Mlynarska, a ballerina 21 years his junior. Nela fell in love with Arthur when she was just 18; unfortunately for her, he was in a midst of an affair with an Italian princess. Not content to wait out the tryst (or participate in a menage-a-trios?), Nela marrid Mieczyslaw Munz instead. Munz was also a pianist!\n\nWere Munz and Rubinstein rivals on Poland's piano scene? Did Nela marry the former to spite the latter? Who knows. Eventually she waited out the affair, ditched Munz and married Rubinstein. She was 24, he 45. Their love endured for decades!\n\nUnfortunately for Nela, Arthur wasn't exactly faithful (she might have gotten a hint from that Italian princess). Rubinstein spent his life having liaisons and fathering children left and right. He did stay married to Nela until 1977, finally divorcing after 45 years of marriage. The 90-year-old Rubinstein married concert manager Annabelle Whitestone, all of 33 years young.\n\nWe're not the only ones who are saps for romance!",
