  "description": "For those not familiar with the works of Astrid Lindgren, Pippi Longstocking is a red-haired, mischievous, nine-year-old girl. She lives all alone, owns a horse and a monkey, wears giant shoes, makes up strange stories, has a suitcase filled with gold coins, and is THE STRONGEST GIRL IN THE WORLD. She is, in a word, awesome.\n\nAnd, no, there is absolutely no indication that Pippi is Jewish. Well, except one.\n\nPippi's father, a sea captain and island king, is named Ephraim. And while we're not experts on Swedish first names, we're pretty sure that Ephraim doesn't exactly fit. In fact, searching for Swedish Ephraims arrives at the one and only — the fictional Longstocking. So why on earth would Lindgren saddle Pippi's father with such a Jewish name?\n\nYour guess is as good as ours. That being said, we're not exactly going to proclaim Pippi Jewish — she does refer to her dead mother as an angel who lives in the sky. Clearly, there is some goyishe influence there. And then, \"Longstocking\" is not exactly a Jewish surname, so she is a quarter at best...\n\nPippi Longstocking, a quarter Jewish? That's awesome enough for us!",
