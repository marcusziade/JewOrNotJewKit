  "description": "So, there is going to be a \"Naked Gun\" remake. We have no words.\n\nFine, we have some words.\n\n\"Naked Gun\", of course, was the brilliant spoof by the trio of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, starring the incomparable Leslie Nielsen as Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad! There were two sequels, the first one nearly as good as the original.\n\nWell, it's back. (Sort of.) Next year's release will feature Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin... Jr. Let's do the math here... no, it's not worth it. Liam Neeson is Leslie Nielsen's son. OK.\n\nNo one from the original movies is back for this. Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker are retired, so this one is being helmed by Akiva Schaffer, probably best known as the Jewish one in The Lonely Island who is not Andy Samberg. The last movie he directed was \"Chip n' Dale: Rescue Rangers\", so we guess he has a history of reboots of our cherished childhood memories?\n\nWell, there is one way it's guaranteed to be better than the original: whomever they cast as Drebin Jr's sidekick can't be worse than OJ Simpson. Otherwise, we feel watching it will be just like eating a spoonful of Drano. It will leave you hollow inside...",
