STEPHEN HAWKING!\n\nAnd in the blue corner, from South Bronx, New York, New York, weighing in at 145 lbs, the Hebrew Prodigy, the Bearded Mastermind, the Quark Confiner, with a record of 18 wins and 132 draws, the challenger... LEONARD SUSSKIND!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, LET'S GET READY TO... ARGUE!!!\n\nOur subject today is the black hole information paradox. Mr. Hawking claims that inside black holes, quantum information is lost, and who are we to argue with the Timeless Wonder! Looks like another easy victory for the champion!\n\nBut what's this? Oh, no! Hawking had never seen this coming! The challenger, Susskind, just presented an astonishing argument. Ladies and gentlemen, I have never seen anything like this! The Sitting Professor is dumbfounded! The Quantum Gravitator is shaking his head! Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot believe this! Astonishing! Unbelievable! Stephen Hawking has been proven wrong! Steven Hawking concedes! Stephen Hawking loses! \n\nAnd now, your new Heavybrain Champion of the World... Leonard... SUSSKIND!!!",
