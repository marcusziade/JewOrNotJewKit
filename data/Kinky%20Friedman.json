  "description": "2 to 1: the odds for finding another Jewish country singer. For whatever reason, we're cautiously optimistic.\n\n20 to 1: the odds for another Jew running for the Governor of Texas. No need to be optimistic there.\n\n2,000 to 1: the odds that said country singer and Gubernatorial hopeful will also be an acclaimed mystery writer. To say we're pessimistic is to put it mildly.\n\n2,000,000 to 1: the odds for another Jew being named \"Kinky\". And if any parent out there wants to prove us wrong and give their son or daughter that name, please don't. It's just not worth it. And if you do, good luck finding someone who will pay out on those odds.*\n\n*The information on this site is for entertainment purposes only.
