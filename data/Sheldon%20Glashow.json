  "description": "Nobel laureate Sheldon Glashow did not invent tadpoles. The honor belongs to Abdus Salam, also a Nobel laureate.\n\nWait, what? Tadpoles? No, silly, not those tadpoles. These tadpoles. Huh?\n\nThese tadpoles are part of quantum physics and are made up of an external leg that gives input to a correlation function. They are important in massless theories. We lost you already, haven't we?\n\nAnyway, Salam first drew these tadpoles in 1961, but they didn't get usage until three years later, when Glashow and fellow Jew Sidney Coleman explained their importance.\n\n\"Tadpole\" wasn't even the original proposed name. Glashow and Coleman wanted to go with \"spermion\".\n\nNo, not those...\n\nfunction loadPic() {\n document.getElementById('pic').src = 'img/other/tadpole.gif';\n}",
