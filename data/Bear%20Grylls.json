  "description": "Edward Grylls, modern adventurer (he is very very remotely Jewish), host of \"Man vs Wild\" and such specials as \"Worst Case Scenario\", \"Get Out Alive\", \"Escape from Hell\", and \"Mission Survive\", is, yes, nicknamed \"Bear\".\n\nNo, that has nothing to do with Grylls' wild escapades; he got the nickname from his sister when he was a week old. Maybe the sister thought he resembled a teddy bear. (Awwwww!)\n\nAlthough, who knows: perhaps the nickname had a role in his career choices. It's hard to imagine someone named Bear in a normal 9-to-5 job, isn't it?\n\nDid our own childhood nicknames have effect on our adult lives?\n\nLet's not answer that.",
