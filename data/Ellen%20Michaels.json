  "description": "Recently, a reader asked us to look into profiling Ellen Michaels, a Jewish photographer from Queens. We never heard of Ellen, so we decided to google her.\n\nThe top link sent us to her official website, EllenMichaels.com. We clicked on it, only to be met with the following message:\n\nThis page has been blocked: Pornography.\n\nAfter a chewing out from our manager about usage of work computers, we obviously had to follow up. So we went home, and, when the wife was soundly asleep, went to Michaels' website.\n\nWell... this is strange. Michaels is a wildlife photographer. Nice pictures of birds and butterflies. Where is the porn?\n\nSo back to Google we went. The second link took us to Michaels' Wikipedia page, which quickly explained the confusion. Yes, she is currently a photographer. But back in the 70s, she was a Playboy centerfold. And before the career change, she was featured on a number of album covers, including a rather famous one for Salsoul Orchestra.\n\nWe'd show you the picture, but... we don't want OUR website blocked.",
