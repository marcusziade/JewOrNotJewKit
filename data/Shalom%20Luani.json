  "description": "By all accounts, Shalom Luani is an unremarkable NFL player. He is a special teamer who has spent the last three seasons shuffling from the Raiders to the Seahawks to the Chargers to the Texans. But there is more to Shalom that meets the eye. (No, it's not that he is Jewish. Thanks for asking.)\n\nShalom is a rarity in the modern sporting world: he has played at the highest level in two different types of football. There's the NFL, natch, but he also played soccer in a World Cup... qualifier. For American Samoa. Alright, maybe not exactly the highest level there.\n\nAmerican Samoa was once known as the worst soccer team ever, in 2001 famously losing to Australia 31:0. (Not a typo: thirty-one to nothing!) By the time qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup came about, they had not won a game... ever. Enter Shalom, then at the age of 17. He scored in the Samoans' first ever win against Tonga, and then added another in a tie against that powerhouse, Cook Islands. The Samoan World Cup quest ended in the next game, but Shalom forever wrote himself into his island's record books.\n\nSomewhat remarkable?",
