  "description": "We're strong supporters of alliteration here at JONJ. In case that had not come to your attention.\n\nWe feel, when putting together our profiles, that using words that start with the same letters adds a certain poetry to our prose. This act of intentional alliteration gives our writing a flow, a feel, an inherent movement that makes a pithier profile, a simpler study.\n\nSo what of Sergei Dovlatov, Russian/Jewish writer of short stories? Well he had a rule that none of the words in his sentences could start with the same letter.\n\nWriting is hard enough without adding arbitrary rules, no? Doesn't destroying the rhythm of the writing hurt the overall read of the story? \n\nApparently not, according to Sergei's many stolid supporters. While most of his work was not revealed until after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, Dovlatov is considered one of the great Russian writers. Which is another way of saying he was really skilled at sad, depressing stories.\n\nSo we will (dammit) try to support Sergei (dammit) by following his own form (dammit). After all (dammit), such a Soviet (dammit!) is deserving of our devotion (dammit dammit dammit!)\n\nSeriously, you try writing like he does. It's a total pain in the... buttocks.",
