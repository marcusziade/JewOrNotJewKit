  "description": "As if you couldn't tell, we take great interest in names here at JONJ. Take Goldie Hawn, for instance.\n\nThat last name sounds pretty goyishe, doesn't it? It certainly is: Goldie got it from her gentile father.\n\nBut that first name... Oh, it's as Jewish as it gets! You don't see many Goldies running around anymore, but we're pretty sure that if you are part of the Tribe, you probably have a great-grandmother with that name. Maybe even two. And when you climb up that family tree an extra level or a couple, you're bound to be bombarded with a few more Goldies. Interesting image.\n\nAs for Goldie herself, she used to consider herself a Jewish Buddhist, but now is back to plain old Jew. Just the way we like it.\n\nAnd we'll discount the rumors that her name at birth was Studlendgehawn. Sadly, that name is completely fake, or we would have taken great interest in that...",
