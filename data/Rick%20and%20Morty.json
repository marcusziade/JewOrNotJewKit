  "description": "At first look, Rick and Morty from \"Rick and Morty\" remind one of Doc and Marty from \"Back to the Future\"... that is, if Doc was an alcoholic and Marty was a moron.\n\nBut Rick and Morty do more than travel through time. They encounter aliens, visit parallel dimensions, have sex with robots, splice DNA, make deals with Satan, and, yes, get drunk. Well, Rick does. Morty is still underage.\n\nAlright, let's get right to it. Morty's name is, well, Morty. Mortimer. And no one NOT Jewish has been named Mortimer for at least the last 100 years. (Come to think, no one Jewish has been named that either... But we digress.)\n\nDespite the clunky monicker, the other names don't check out. Morty's last name is Smith. Rick, his maternal grandfather, has the last name of Sanchez, so the pair would rate pretty highly on HispanicOrNotHispanic.com. On our site? The family celebrates Christmas. We're going to have to go with a no. (And, considering Morty is rather dimwitted, it's probably for the best.)\n\nUnless... Well, for all of Rick and Morty's visits to parallel universes to see different versions of themselves... Wouldn't it be possible that some of those alternate Rick and Mortys are Jewish?\n\nYes, it is. But we'll leave it to the parallel universe version of us to write that profile.",
