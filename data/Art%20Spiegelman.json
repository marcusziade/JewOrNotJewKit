  "description": "Nazis burned books.\n\nThe images of these bonfires are harrowing even today. There are some steps between burning books and burning people, but not that many.\n\nToday, books are not burned, at least publicly. They are banned.\n\nYou probably have heard of the latest target: \"Maus\" by Art Spiegelman. It's the only graphic novel to ever win the Pulitzer Prize. Spiegelman depicted the horrors of the Holocaust, as relayed by his father, a prisoner in Auschwitz. In \"Maus\", Jews became mice. Germans became cats. French became frogs. It's not subtle, but it's not supposed to be.\n\nOf course, what Spiegelman depicts is anything but cartoonish. We need to remember. \"Maus\" helps us do that. \n\nRecently, a county in Tennessee (it doesn't deserve to be named) banned \"Maus\" because... well, we can list their reasons, but let's state the obvious:\n\nThey are today's Nazis.",
