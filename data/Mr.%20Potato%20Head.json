  "description": "We were looking forward to viewing \"Toy Story\", since we deliberately put it off until our children were old enough to watch it with us. So now they are, and we did. Good times. Good times.\n\nNow, we being who we are, watching \"Toy Story\" had an ulterior motive. We wanted to figure out if Mr. Potato Head could be Jewish. He's voiced by Don Rickles, after all.\n\nSadly, we got our answer about two minutes into the movie, when Mr. Potato Head crossed himself. So much for that. Rickles wouldn't be the first Jew to play a goy on film, of course.\n\nBut then we watched \"Toy Story 2\", when Mr. Potato Head gets a wife... Mrs. Potato Head, obviously. She is voiced by Estelle Harris, better known as George Costanza's mother. And anyone who sounds like Estelle Harris MUST be Jewish... Plus have you seen the accessories? There is no other way about it.\n\nSo there you have it, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are just your average interfaith couple. A Christian husband (we'll give him \"Barely a Jew\" because of Rickles) and a Jewish wife.\n\nWhat would that make their kids?\n\nIf only they discussed that in \"Toy Story 3\"!\n\nfunction flip() {\n remember();\n}\nfunction flip2() {\n memorize();\n setImage('mrs__potato_head');\n setRatings(4, 5, 3);\n setVerdict('Jew');\n setTitle('Mrs. Potato Head');\n}",
