  "description": "ESPN almost fired Linda Cohn right after she started. Supposedly it was because her love of sports didn't come through on TV. We don't buy that.\n\nCohn was a lifelong sports fan and an athlete, who even played on her high school's BOYS hockey team. We remember watching her when she first debuted on SportsCenter. There was absolutely nothing wrong with her.\n\nNo, we bet it had everything with her being a \"her\". The boys club that surrounds sports, the idiots who yell at the TV every time a woman has the gall to read highlights...\n\nWell, Cohn stuck it through and is still at ESPN, all these years after, the one constant on the ever-changing network. She has proven to be one of the network's best anchors and is even a member of the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nCohn laid the trail for many women that followed her; a female sports anchor is no longer uncommon. Alas, there are still many stupid men who roll their eyes every time a woman talks about sports...\n\nGrow up.",
