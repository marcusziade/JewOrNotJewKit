  "description": "We have nothing against Ben Stiller. Especially not the early Ben Stiller; we first saw him in the early 90s and said, \"Wow! He is actually pretty funny! Who the hell is he?\" (And yes, we do remember the exact quote from back then, you will have to take our word for it.)\n\nAnd then, \"There's Something About Mary\" happened. It wasn't nearly as funny as everyone seemed to think, but Stiller suddenly became the \"it boy\" of American comedies. And then, \"Meet the Parents\" happened. Now, we're oversaturated with Stiller. Stiller is everywhere. Try to find an American comedy of the five past years in which Ben does not make at least a cameo. Oh sure, it's possible... it's just much harder than it seems.\n\nAnd while one can praise his early work, debate the merits of \"Mary\" and \"Parents\", or ignore another cliche romantic comedy with Ben as the male lead, we Jews could do much worse for a front man in Hollywood. (And yes, Stiller is 100% Jewish: his mother converted before Ben was born.) So sure, his face is a bit askew and he seems to mail it in half the time, but how many Jews hold leading man status in American cinema today? Or ever?\n\nExactly. And he did bag that gorgeous shiksa Christine Taylor.",
