Here is the first letter we've received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I am about to enter high school and my nose is too big. Should I get a nose job? â€” Alex Katz, 14, Beverly Hills, California\n\nDear Alex,\n\nThank you for contacting us on such a personal matter. Choosing whether to get a nose job is one of the most difficult decisions a Jewish teenager in Beverly Hills will ever face.\n\nSo should you go ahead with it? Take a look at the famous actor Dustin Hoffman. You might know him from such films as Your parents might know him as the two-time Oscar-winning actor from \"The Graduate\", \"Kramer vs Kramer\", \"Tootsie\", and \"Rain Man\". When Mr. Hoffman was your age, his parents offered to get him a nose job. Dustin chose against it, and rode that distinguished appendage into becoming one of the most accomplished Hollywood actors today of the 20th century.\n\nWait, Alex, are you a girl? If so, ignore all of the above.\n\nYours in rhinoplasty,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
