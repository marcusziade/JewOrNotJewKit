  "description": "Even a short Saturday Night Live career stays remembered if the comedian in question performs a memorable recurring character. For example, Billy Crystal only spent one year on SNL, but because of the \"You look... mahvelous!\" guy, he is forever etched in the annals of the show. Now compare that to Julia Louis-Dreyfus... Yes, she was on SNL. From 1982 to 1985. Look it up.\n\nWhich brings us to Rachel Dratch, who spent seven years on SNL, mostly as a supporting player. With one exception: she was Debbie Downer, an orgy of pessimism unleashed. And even as Dratch's career hasn't exactly been on fire since her departure from the show, her character lives on, her name entering the lexicon, trailing the actress wherever she goes.\n\nBut that's alright. Even as Dratch is slapped with an unflattering moniker for the rest of her life, at least she'll be remembered.\n\nIt could have been worse.\n\nShe could have been It's Pat!",
