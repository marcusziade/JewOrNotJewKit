  "description": "During World War II, a young man named George Blake was all set to marry Iris Peake, who worked as a secretary for MI6, Britain's Secret Intelligence. Unfortunately for George, her family rejected him on the basis of his Jewish roots.\n\nWe're not sure if George's potential in-laws knew of his past. As a teenager, he was part of the Dutch anti-Nazi resistance, evading imprisonment by escaping to London dressed as a monk. Clearly, they had no idea about his future.\n\nAfter the war, Blake himself joined MI6, and was sent to its Seoul office. Soon later, the Korean War broke out, and he was captured. Blake was eventually freed, and ended up working for MI6 in Berlin, recruiting Soviets as double agents.\n\nOh, Iris' antisemtic parents! How they must have wept at their daughter's missed chance to marry a true hero!\n\nA true Soviet hero, that is.\n\nWhile kept captured by North Koreans, Blake read up on Communism and decided that it just might be his cup of tea. So while in Berlin, it was HE who was the double agent. Blake gave away British secrets to the Russians, betrayed operatives, and almost single-handedly brought down MI6's operations in Eastern Europe.\n\nBlake eventually was found out, captured, and escaped once again â€” this time from prison. He was smuggled into the Soviet Union, and still resides in Russia, still trying to keep true to the communist ideals.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe Iris' family dodged a bullet there.",
