  "description": "About a decade ago, comedian Dave Attell, Jew, had a show on Comedy Central that was rather groundbreaking... Only we didn't know it at the time.\n\nThe show was called Insomniac. Attell, with a trusty cameraman by his side, would venture into various cities when the sun was down. He would document what he saw, and... how do we say it nicely...\n\nThe freaks weirdos came out.\n\nSo why are we calling it groundbreaking? Look at your television now. No, really, look.\n\nWhat do you see? Reality show after reality show. Without naming names or titles, these are... weirdos. Clearly, Attell was ahead of his time.\n\nSo what happened with him after Insomniac?\n\nWell, Comedy Central brought him back to host a revival of The Gong Show. It was canceled after eight episodes.\n\nThey can't all be groundbreaking.",
