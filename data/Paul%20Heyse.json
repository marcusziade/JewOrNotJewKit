  "description": "We're willing to bet that you, dear reader, have never read anything written by Paul (von) Heyse. In fact, you have probably never heard of Paul (von) Heyse. Oh, you have? Well, let us congratulate you! This is not the level of sophistication we expect from our readership, and yet, here we are. This one is on us.\n\nFor those not as up on turn-of-the-20th-century German literature as that select few, Paul (von) Heyse is actually the first ever Jew to win the Nobel in Literature. So, quite significant, all things considering. He won it for... well, we obviously haven't read him, so let's quote the Nobel committee: \"a tribute to the consummate artistry, permeated with idealism\". Sounds impressive, doesn't it!?\n\n(Von) Heyse was actually quite prolific: he wrote numerous novels, short stories, and plays. Heck, the Novel committee also called him a \"literary genius\", so who are we to argue?\n\nErotic poetry. Paul (von) Heyse won the Nobel for erotic poetry.",
