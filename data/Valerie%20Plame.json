  "description": "Ah, the Uncategorized category. A hodgepodge from every walk of life. Magicians. Chess players. Astronauts. A competitive eater. Supreme Court Justices. Monica Lewinsky.\n\nAnd... spies. That's right, spies. We started with the turncoat Rosenbergs, but then profiled British super-agent Sidney Reilly, and are now adding American super-agent Valerie Plame, she of the CIA leak scandal.\n\nPlame, a great-granddaughter of a rabbi, did not find out about her Jewish roots until later in her life. We guess Valerie's family was as good at keeping secrets as she herself was.\n\nSo, to all the Jewish spies out there, our email is at the bottom of this page. We promise your secret is safe with us... we just need a couple of other names to give spies their own category and rescue them from Uncategorized.\n\n(Editor's update, 2017: Ugh, Valerie. We know we have you as \"Barely a Jew\", but to go full antisemite?)",
