  "description": "By our count, Antonio Garay is the 21st Jewish (or part Jewish) NFL player or coach we have profiled. And yes, don't let that haircut fool you, Garay is a Jew, a child of a Catholic father and a Jewish mother. \"Even though I am diverse,\" Garay says, \"first and foremost, I am Jewish.\" So that's settled.\n\nAnd of these 21 Jewish NFLers, Garay is the seventh San Diego Charger, an astonishing one third (the others: Garay's current teammate David Binn, Igor Olshansky, now with the Cowboys, Hall of Famer Ron Mix, current Viking Greg Camarillo, Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman, and... Al Davis, whose coaching career started with the Chargers when they were based in Los Angeles).\n\nSo that makes us wonder, what is it that attracts the Jews to Southern California? It has to be the beautiful weather, right? But then Jews tend to favor Florida...\n\nWe definitely need to get to the bottom of this. Starting tomorrow, we're dropping everything and leaving the dregs of the East coast for sunny, sunny San Diego.\n\nYes, that will be us, lounging on the beach, taking in the warm weather, the cool breeze from the ocean, the endless supply of bikini-clad blondes, and the occasional Chargers game.\n\nOr not.\n\nBut one can dream, right?",
