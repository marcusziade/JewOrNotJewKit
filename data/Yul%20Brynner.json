  "description": "We've developed a few templates over the years here at JONJ. One fairly common one is when we take a person with a Jewish sounding name, point out all the ways in which they appear Jewish, and then twist it around by pointing out they're not Jews.\n\nBut can we do the reverse? You betcha. Take our follically challenged friend, Yul Brynner.\n\nBorn in Russia, Yul Brynner claimed to have Romany heritage, and even released albums singing Gypsy music. His acting career is associated with just two roles â€” the King of Siam (in the King and I) and Ramses II (in Ten Commandments). Even the name, Yul: as in Yule Log and Yule Tidings. The man just screams goy.\n\nSo can you guess where we're going here? Yul was a hidden Jew, right? Especially since he continued the family tradition by vehemently denying any Jewish ancestry...\n\nNope. Not Jewish. He wasn't even Romany.\n\nHow about that twist?",
