  "description": "Most Jews, just by the nature of the transatlantic flight, end up settling in the Northeast. New York, New Jersey, Boston, even Montreal. \n\nBut, as with all peoples, this is just a starting point. Most of us tend to migrate South as the call of New Israel (aka, Florida) becomes louder with each additional liver spot we grow. North and East are not really options. Simple geography sort of limits the possibilities there. That leaves West, and there's many a Jew who sets out to make their fortune in Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nA less common destination, however, would have to be Kansas, which is where Paul Rudd's parents headed for after he was born in Passaic, New Jersey. Kansas?! It's the land of corn and cows, not rabbis and rugelach. \n\nWhat would posses a Jewish person to go there? Even on vacation, let alone to make a permanent residence. Whatever the reason, perhaps it was for the best. After all, Paul Rudd is one of our favorite funny actors; someone getting awfully close to that \"I must see this because he is in it\" status. \n\nAnd if any of that talent comes anywhere from his Kansan upbringing, well, we can certainly approve of that. \n\nFrom a distance, anyway.",
