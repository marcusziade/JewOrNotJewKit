  "description": "Paul Michael Glaser's first movie role was in \"Fiddler on the Roof\", he is most notorious for playing Starsky in the original \"Starsky and Hutch\", but we're here to talk about his lesser-known directing career. From 1984 to 1996, Glaser paused the acting, and directed six films. The third of those was \"The Running Man\".\n\nOh, \"The Running Man\"! Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his Schwarzeneggerness, our old friend Yaphet Kotto, pro wrestler and future governor Jesse Ventura, NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown, and game show host Richard Dawson as... a game show host. Truly a cast for the ages.\n\n\"The Running Man\" is a dystopian view of a gleam future where reality shows rule the roost, which made it a lot like today's television, except with more murder and more Arnold. Yes, murder. The reality show contestants got killed as part the show. We guess we're not there just yet.\n\nWe won't spoil it, but let's just say that Arnold gets off a number of wonderful one liners, including the original \"I'll be back\", and the spectacular \"Women. Can't live with 'em, can't live... with 'em.\" But enough about \"The Running Man\"!\n\nThe last movie Glaser directed? \"Kazaam\", which starred Shaquille O'Neal as a rapping genie.\n\nAnd you wonder why his directing career is not that well known...",
