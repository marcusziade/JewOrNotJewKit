  "description": "A trip down the Wikipedia rabbit hole uncovered the name of Hungarian Jewish figure skater Lily Kronberger. She was the second ever women's world champion, winning the title four straight times between 1908 and 1911.\n\nThe same rabbit hole led us to something strange: Kronberger was also listed as the Hungarian MEN'S figure skating champion for 1908 through 1910. Something is rotten in... err, Hungary. (Or, at least, incredibly progressive...)\n\nThe explanation is rather simple (we'll let you decide if it was progressive or not): in its early incarnation, Hungary's figure skating championship was open to both men and women, so the two genders competed against each other. Men dominated, if not for Kronberger's reign. When the women got their own national championship in 1924, the previous winners of the mixed competition were grandfathered (emphasis on \"fathered\") as men's champions. Which, in Kronberger's case, was rather absurd.\n\nYet not as absurd as her figure skating outfit...\n\nThanks, Wikipedia rabbit hole!",
