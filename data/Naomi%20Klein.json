  "description": "We don't put much stock in internet polls.\n\nRemember those New 7 Wonders of the World shenanigans a year ago? At the end, the voters went with the Christ the Redeemer over the Eiffel Tower. Well, we've been to Rio and we've been to Paris. Only one of the two had impressed us. It wasn't even close. We'll give you a clue: it wasn't a statue of some dead dude with outstretched arms.\n\nOr, take the Top 100 Living Intellectuals poll from a few years ago. Honestly, is there anything less intellectual than deciding who is more intellectual? Maybe if they presented the top 100 without ranks, then it could work. But no, they have it listed, 1 through a 100. Pope Benedict XVI at #17? Sigh.\n\nThe highest woman on the list? Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, who clocks in at #11. Her big spiel is the evils of corporate globalization. And she's obviously Jewish. And that seems great and everything, except... well, she is not exactly a fan of Israel, speaking of the virtues of the Arab-led boycott against it.\n\nAnd this is the world's top intellectual woman? Seriously, we shouldn't put much stock in internet polls.",
