  "description": "Let's get this straight. The real Kramer is Jewish. The Kramer character is not Jewish. Almost everyone involved in Seinfeld, from the creators, to the producers, to the major actors are Jewish. Michael Richards... well... ummm... Hmmm.\n\nTurns out that even though Richards' parents are not Jewish, he was raised by Jewish mentors. \"I agree with the concepts and the religious beliefs of Judaism and I've adopted Judaism as my religion,\" Richards is quoted as saying. So... Jew?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with Richards himself. Oh, sure, the recent racist tirade is not going to win him any friends, but we have to look beyond that. As it turns out, the quote above was released by his publicist in response to the tirade... and it quickly backtracked to \"Richards thinks of himself as Jewish\".\n\nYeah... that's not gonna do. Sorry, Michael, we're gonna need a little more. At least a bris or something. If only you kept your mouth shut, we've might have been a bit more lenient.\n\nMaybe Kramer should have taken a clue from Costanza and left on a high note.",
