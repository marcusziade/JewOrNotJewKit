  "description": "Vanellope Von Schweetz (what's with that name?) is not implicitly Jewish, so who better to ask that her voice actress (and complete lookalike), Sarah Silverman?\n\n\"I say she is [Jewish]. Nobody has said no. So, yeah.\"\n\nWho's going to refute it? Not us!\n\nWreck-It Ralph's screenwriter and its recent sequel's director Phil Johnson agrees:\n\n\"A Jewish animated princess, absolutely.\"\n\nSo that settles it! Wait... what was that second part? It's been a while since we saw the original movie, so we completely forgot: it's revealed at the end that Vanellope is of royal heritage!\n\nWe got our Disney Jewish princess.\n\nStill, if she is indeed Jewish... what's with that name?",
