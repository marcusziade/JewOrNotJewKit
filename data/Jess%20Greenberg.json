  "description": "How does one get a JONJ profile?\n\nWell, being famous helps. But after 2000 of these, some not-so-distinguished people have slipped through.\n\nOf course, how does one define fame, especially in this day and age? It used to be that being famous meant being listed in an encyclopedia. But have you opened an encyclopedia lately? Of course, you haven't. All you've opened is Wikipedia. And anyone can get a Wikipedia article. ANYONE.\n\nSo is Jess Greenberg famous? Not by the old definition of the world. But she does have a Wikipedia article. And she does have millions of followers on YouTube, where she does cover versions of everything from AC/DC to Beyonce to Fleetwood Mac to Bon Jovi to Red Hot Chili Peppers to Bob Dylan. And, yeah, she looks like that.\n\nApparently, boobs help get you a JONJ profile.\n\nOh! Being Jewish helps, too!",
