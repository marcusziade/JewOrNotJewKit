  "description": "Whoa, a Tom Selleck profile! Can't wait for all the mustache jokes!\n\nSlow down. There definitely will be some mustache commentary, but this profile is really about \"Three Men and a Baby\". Yes, \"Three Men and a Baby\", the highest grossing film of 1987. Yes, you read that right, a comedy about... three men (and a baby) topped the box office for the entire year. Cue the screams \"they don't make movies like this anymore!\" They really don't...\n\nIn the movie, the titular three men (Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson) have a baby (you don't say!) dropped on their doorstep. The baby is Danson's (we think we got that right?), but all three are stuck taking care of it. Hilarity ensues!? That's the movie. No, seriously, that's the entire movie. The title says it all.\n\nSo, Selleck, Guttenberg, Danson: could the three leading men's careers have diverged so widely? Selleck: once Magnum P.I. and almost Indiana Jones, reduced to made-for-TV dreck and reverse mortgage commercials, his iconic mustache drooping from sorrow. Guttenberg: as  argued before, the #1 comedy star of the 1980s, dropped off the face of the Earth, hoping for a Police Academy sequel that will never come. Danson: then \"only\" a TV star, now perhaps one of America's most revered actors...\n\nThe movie spawned a rather unremarkable sequel, \"Three Men and a Little Lady\", and was even supposed to be brought back in 2010 for \"Three Men and a Bride\". That never happened, however... they just don't make movies like that anymore.\n\nThat's probably for the best.",
