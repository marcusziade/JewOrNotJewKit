  "description": "As a Jew, I've been called many a bad name, but this is the first time in my life that I've been called a \"damned gentile\"! â€” Simon Bamberger\n\nHow did a Jew get called a gentile? And who the heck is Simon Bamberger?\n\nSimon Bamberger was the Governor of Utah (yes, you read that right. Of UTAH!) from 1917 to 1921. And yes, he was a Jew. How did a Jew get elected in Utah? His religion did not exactly endear him to some of the citizens, and he was subject to various antisemitic campaigns. However, he was pro-prohibition, which worked out rather well considering the makeup of the state.\n\nSo, yes, \"gentile\". At the time, Mormons considered everyone non-Mormon a \"gentile\". You see, Mormons have an ongoing obsession with Judaism and Jews... and apparently they were even borrowing our terms.\n\nAt least they didn't call Bamberger a \"damned yid\"!",
