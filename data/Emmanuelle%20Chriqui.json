  "description": "To be honest, we haven't seen \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" yet. (Although it seems right up our alley: Jewish stereotypes. Toilet humor. Hacky sack. We just need to get past the fact that it is an Adam Sandler movie.)\n\nIn the film, Sandler plays a former Israeli commando who retires to become a hairdresser in New York. So he ends up working in a salon for a Palestinian woman, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui. (Oh, we wonder if the two will look past their cultural differences and end up together!) And, we are assured, hilarity ensues.\n\nBy now, you know where this is going. The lovely Miss Chriqui is not Palestinian at all. She is Jewish, and what's more, she was raised Orthodox. Now, that upbringing did not stop her from engaging in a threesome on HBO's \"Entourage\", but who are we to complain about that?\n\nIt's still more respectable than appearing in an Adam Sandler movie.",
