  "description": "With over 1000 of these under our belt, you'd think we wouldn't be surprised when it's revealed someone is Jewish. We've seen it all, 1000 times over, after all.\n\nYet when we found out that Danny McBride is a Jew, we were a little shocked. Danny McBride, whose acting resume is filled with rubes and rednecks? Danny McBride, best known for playing the cock-fighting, cocaine-snorting, baseball washout Kenny Powers on HBO's \"Eastbound \u0026 Down\"? Jewish? Really? How?\n\nWell, let Danny explain.\n\n\"My mom is Jewish,\" he says. \"Seth Rogen says I have all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. I can eat pork and be funny.\"\n\nTurns out we were right to be surprised; McBride is exaggerating. His mother is only a quarter Jewish, making him an eighth. Eating pork AND being funny? Not bloody likely!",
