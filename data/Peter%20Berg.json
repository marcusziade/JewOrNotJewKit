They are transported to a strange land, where candy grows on trees and rivers of chocolate flow. They are tasked with the quest: find the missing King Kandy (Kevin Kline). Can they escape the evil Lord Licorice (Clive Owen) and befriend the lovely Princess Lolly (Anne Hathaway)? Beware, things are not as they seem in... \"Candy Land\"!\n\nAfrica is struck by a famine! Four best friends: a hippo (Adam Sandler), a hippo (David Spade), a hippo (Rob Schneider), and a hippo (Kevin James) have nothing to eat! Can they find food or will they starve? Hilarity and hijinks ensue in... \"Hungry Hungry Hippos\"!\n\nOh, crap. They all have been optioned for movies already. Yes, even the hippos...",
