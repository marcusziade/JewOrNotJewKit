  "description": "Ed Asner, Jew, won more acting Emmys than anyone else: seven. Five of those were for playing the same character: Lou Grant, first on the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\", and then on... \"Lou Grant\". What makes the situation unique is that the former was a comedy, while its spin-off was a drama. That rarely happens, yet we wonder...\n\n\"Seinfeld\": Kramer leaves New York and moves to rural Minnesota, where he opens a bait shop. His cautionary tales of big-city life enlighten and scare locals. He develops a drinking problem.\n\n\"Friends\": It turns out that Phoebe's husband and twin sister are having an affair. After both die in a car crash, Phoebe is left to take care of her sister's children. She develops a drinking problem.\n\n\"Everybody Loves Raymond\": Robert is offered a job as a police chief in a rural Iowa town. Soon after, the town is shaken up by a serial killer that targets schoolteachers. Robert develops a drinking problem.\n\n\"The Office\": Dwight leaves the office to run his beet farm full-time (wait, they tried this?). The falling prices of beets and his large extended family bear down on him. He develops a drinking problem.\n\n\"Arrested Development\": Tobias and Lindsay leave the family, moving to rural Nebraska. Tobias re-opens his psychiatric practice, helping  townspeople and becoming a pillar in the community. Lindsay develops a drug problem.\n\nSee, some of these write themselves!",
