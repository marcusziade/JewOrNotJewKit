  "description": "Today on JONJ, we're set to correct an injustice. An injustice that occurred in 1955, years before we were born. An injustice that was the Nobel Prize for Medicine for that year.\n\nWe have nothing against Axel Hugo Theodor Theorell per se. We're sure he was a brilliant enough guy, and his work on the \"nature and mode of action of oxidation enzymes\" must have been vitally important. And he was Swedish. And used to head the Nobel Institute. Talk about home-field advantage.\n\nFor you see, those oxidation enzymes might be swell and all, but in 1955, Jewish American Jonas Salk developed the vaccine for polio. We're not really sure what oxidation enzymes do. They're probably somewhat important on some level. But we're willing to bet that the discovery of their \"nature and mode of action\" saved a lot less lives and had a lot less effect on the world than Salk's invention.\n\nIt's a small consolation, of course, but we hereby award Jonas Salk with only the sixth perfect score in JONJ history. It might not carry the million-dollar prize with it like Nobel does, and it might not have any weight outside this website. But we can't think of a worthier candidate.",
