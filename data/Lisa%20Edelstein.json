  "description": "A couple things have bothered us when re-watching Seinfeld (well, more than a couple of things; that whole cigar store Indian episode, but let's stick to two):\n\n#1. George Costanza's supposed dating problems. No, not because George is a self-described \"short, stocky, slow-witted bald man\". It's because this short, stocky, slow-witted bald man constantly complains that he can't get women. Well... he can! Episode after episode, George dates a different gorgeous woman! The queue doesn't exactly match Jerry's exquisite parade, but it comes close. Take Karen, for instance (played by Lisa Edelstein, now better known from \"House\"). She even lasts two whole episodes! And there are many many more tall, thin, quick-witted full-haired women who can't wait to date George. George!\n\n#2. Everyone on the show, from Jerry to Kramer to Newman to various side characters, owns a car. At the minimum, they know how to drive. We're not sure what version of New York they are living in, but... really? However, since so many episodes deal with parking spot problems, we have to let this one slide.\n\n#3? Maybe we really should discuss that cigar store Indian?",
