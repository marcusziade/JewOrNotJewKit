  "description": "ABC (that's network television) has a somewhat popular show that has been running for a few years: \"Black-ish\", about a middle-class black family. Interestingly, the matriarch, Tracee Ellis Ross, is Jewish.\n\nTracee wasn't born with the last name Ross; her real name is Tracee Silberstein. And while we usually frown at actors who change their names to sound less Jewish, this one doesn't look to be Tracee's fault. It was her father, music exec Robert Ellis Silberstein who dumped his last name and just became Robert Ellis. The family followed suit, with Tracee taking her mother's last name. That mother? That would be the famed singer Diana Ross.\n\n\"Black-ish\" has often been paired with another show, \"The Goldbergs\", which could be its mirror image (mom / dad / three kids / grandpa), but, as the title suggests, that one is about a Jewish family. Strangely, the actress that plays the Jewish matriarch, Wendi McLendon-Covey, is as goyishe as they come.\n\nMaybe the two families can go on \"Wife Swap\". That's not still on network television, is it?",
