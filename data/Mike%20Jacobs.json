  "description": "Baseball teams are always looking for inventive ways to bring in fans. One new idea is to have something called \"Jewish Heritage Day\". You serve kosher hot dogs, sing \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" in Yiddish, and celebrate the Jewish player (yes, singular) on your team with a pre-game ceremony and free t-shirts for the fans.\n\nThe Mets have done it for a few years, and it's a good time. Not sure how many Jews actually come out for it, but it's not the worst idea they've ever had (that idea being, of course, starting that woeful franchise in the first place. But we digress).\n\nOther franchises could certainly follow suit. Though not all: Minnesota, for instance, will just have to be content with Slightly-Less-Pale-Than-Everyone-Else Heritage Day.\n\nBut if you do have a Jewish fan base and want to host your own Jewish Heritage Day, we have one piece of advice.\n\nBefore you print up all those t-shirts, make the signs, and prepare a big ceremony, you're going to want to make sure the player you're celebrating is actually Jewish. \n\nOtherwise you're just gonna look stupid. Right, Florida?",
