  "description": "In 1997, we thought we might be getting our Jewish soccer superstar.\n\nJust 20 years old, Sebastian Rozental tore up the Chilean league with his goals. Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers paid a hefty 3.5 million pounds for his rights. And he was poised to play for Chile in the 1998 World Cup.\n\nAnd then he tore up his knee.\n\nAnd that was it for Rozental. No World Cup; career with Rangers reduced to sporadic appearances; an attempt to regain his form in Argentina and back in Chile; a stint in the US minor leagues and a forgettable year in Major League Soccer; and finally, a last ditch attempt to make something of himself in the land of his forefathers, Israel.\n\nAll of that amounted to jack squat.\n\nAlas, this story has no redemption. Rozental is now retired, a promising career destroyed.\n\nSo much for a Jewish soccer superstar.",
