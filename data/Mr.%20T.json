  "description": "We have a rule here at JONJ: if someone possibly Jewish is seen wearing a cross, they are NOT Jewish. The best they can hope for is a \"Barely a Jew\" verdict, and that's ONLY if they have some Jewish blood.\n\nWe're very, very strict about this.\n\nBut what about the reverse? What if someone Christian wears a Star of David around their neck, like the famed thespian Laurence Tureaud? Does that automatically make them Jewish?\n\nPity the fool who thinks so. We Jews are an exclusive club. Wearing Jewish jewelry might get you on the doorstep, but it won't get you in. Especially if that Star of David is complemented with a number of crosses. That's just not gonna fly.\n\nSorry, Mr. T. You're gonna have to try harder.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nprofileImage.src = 'img/spacer.gif';\nprofileImage.height = 350;\nsetImage('mr_t');\n}",
