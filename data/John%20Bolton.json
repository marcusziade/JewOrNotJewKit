  "description": "Were we the only ones looking forward to the announcement that John Bolton is running for president?\n\nIt might have been our chance to find out if he is related to Michael Bolton.\n\nYou know, John Bolton: massive mustache, former US ambassador the the UN. (Not to get political here, but probably not the most qualified of appointments. Alright, let's get a little political: he is a warmongering lunatic.)\n\nAnd, of course, Michael Bolton: mulletted crooner.\n\nAs previously discussed, Michael Bolton is Jewish. John Bolton? He is 1/8, coming from the Bolton line. So, theoretically, they could be related...\n\nNow, Michael's Boltons were once Bolotins, and we are not sure about John's ancestors. Still, if he was running for president, we're sure his lineage would have been dissected thoroughly.\n\nAnd then, John announced he was NOT running.\n\nProbably for the best, ya know?\n\n(Editor's update: From Trump's crony to righteous(?) whistle-blower? Still a lunatic.)",
