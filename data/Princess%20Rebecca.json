  "description": "In the early days of JONJ, we reserved the century profiles for important figures. #100 is Bob Dylan, #200 is G-d, #300 is the Devil, #400 are the Marx Brothers, #500 is Barbra Streisand. Talk about a lineup.\n\nWith time, the number of profiles grew and the significance of century numbers diminished. Well, #3100 might not be on par with that first five, but it's up there. Princess Rebecca: the first ever official Disney Jewish princess.\n\nWe lamented about the lack of Disney Jewish princesses back in the profiles of Disney Jewy non-princesses Timon (#610) and Kronk (#754), and, not to get Biblical, Leah and Rachel (#1525). Then, in profile #2624, we issued the verdict that Vanellope Von Schweetz from \"Wreck-It Ralph\" is a Jewish princess, because both actress Sarah Silverman and the director said so. Fine, Vanellope can be Jewish. But there are Jewish princesses and there are JEWISH PRINCESSES.\n\nMeet Princess Rebecca. Yes, that's a menorah she is holding in her profile picture. She is voiced by Jamie-Lynn Sigler on the Disney show \"Elena of Avalor\", where she teaches the story of Hanukkah (a safer choice than, say, Purim) to the title character.\n\nObviously, this is not exactly princess perfection. Rebecca is a secondary character; the show is \"Elena of Avalor\", not \"Rebecca of... (we don't know?) Talmudtown\".\n\nThat being said, we more than welcome Rebecca to the Disney canon and to our website. Heck, she is more interesting than Barbra Streisand!",
