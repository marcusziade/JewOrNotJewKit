  "description": "What's the best thing about Hanukkah?\n\nLet's be honest, it's not the presents. Most of the time, they are pretty crappy.\n\nIt's not spinning the dreidel. Have you actually tried it? And, by the way, good job, Jews, teaching your kids gambling at such an early age.\n\nLighting the menorah? No, that's just a fire hazard, especially as you get closer to the eighth night.\n\nNo, the best part of Hanukkah is... LATKES!\n\nYes, latkes, the most delicious of all Jewish cuisine! So simple on the surface, just a fried potato pancake... and yet, so tasty! (Of course, it doesn't have to be so simple. For example, famed chef Michelle Bernstein puts jalapenos in hers.)\n\nBut you know what? Why wait until Hanukkah to eat latkes? You can have them all the time! Your waistline might not agree, but still...\n\nSo if not latkes, what's the best thing about Hanukkah?\n\nChocolate coins. Duh!",
