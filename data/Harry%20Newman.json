  "description": "Towards the end of the college football season, we got a lot of requests to profile eventual Heisman winner Johnny Manziel. We guess his name sounds Jewish to some.\n\nWe passed, noting to ourselves that no Heisman winner in history was ever Jewish. Well... there is one small loophole.\n\nThe Heisman was first awarded in 1935. If only it started three years earlier! In 1932, most major college accolades were won by a Jew, Harry Newman.\n\nNewman played three seasons as Michigan's quarterback, and in that span, lost only one game. His college career culminated with an undefeated season and the mythical national title. Newman was a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\nOh, and he had a pretty good pro career too, leading the New York Giants to three straight title games and setting all kinds of passing records.\n\nAfter retiring, Newman was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nWho needs the Heisman?",
