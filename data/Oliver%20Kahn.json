  "description": "As far as last names go, it doesn't get more Jewish than \"Cohen\". Or any of its derivations, be it \"Kogan\", \"Coen\", \"Cohn\", or \"Kahn\".\n\nOr so we thought.\n\nFor, as it was pointed out to us, Germany's long-time soccer goalkeeper Oliver Kahn is not very likely to be Jewish. Just look at him: 6'2\", 200 pounds, and unmistakably Aryan.\n\nAnd no research has uncovered any proof that Kahn is somehow Jewish. Just as well; from what we read, he sounds like a giant douchebag. But what do we do about the last name?\n\nThe answer here is simple, really. The \"Kahn\" in this case probably does not come from long-forgotten Jewish roots. It likely comes from the German word \"Kahn\", meaning a small boat.\n\nA small boat full of douchebag? No, thank you.",
