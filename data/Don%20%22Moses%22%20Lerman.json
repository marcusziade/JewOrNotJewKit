So let's say we've yet to profile a true JEWISH American hero.)\n\nMeet Don \"Moses\" Lerman.\n\nWorld Baked Beans Eating Champion (6 lbs in 1:48). World Bologna Eating Champion (2.76 lbs in six minutes). World Butter Eating Champion (1.75 lbs in five minutes). World Hamburger Eating Champion (11.25 in ten minutes).\n\nMind-boggling. Earth-shattering. Gut-wrenching.\n\nBut what's that? The bologna on record was made from chicken and... pork? PORK? Don \"Moses\" Lerman, how could you?\n\nA JEWISH American hero you are not.",
