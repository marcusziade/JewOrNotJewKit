  "description": "What were you into when you were seven years old?\n\nDid you like playing board games? Video games, perhaps?\n\nSports? Crap, we forgot our readers are mostly Jewish. Forget sports.\n\nBooks? Cartoons? Television? Movies? Action figures?\n\nCalculus?\n\nDon't smirk! Murray Gell-Mann taught himself calculus at the age of seven.\n\nLet us repeat that so that it sinks in. Murray Gell-Mann taught himself calculus at the age of seven.\n\nSo what happened to this child prodigy? Did he burn out like so many others?\n\nQuite the opposite. Gell-Mann was one of the first to theorize quarks, actually coining the term. He won the Nobel for Physics in 1969.\n\nAnd, who knows, perhaps at that age of seven, he had hobbies outside of calculus. Board games, maybe, or books...\n\nJust not sports. Definitely not sports.",
