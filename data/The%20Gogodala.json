  "description": "Of all the wacky theories about the Lost Tribes of Israel: the Japanese, the Cherokee, the Lemba... Here's the most fantastic one of them all.\n\nThe Gogodala.\n\nRaise your hand if you heard of them. We thought not.\n\nThe Gogodala is one of formerly cannibalistic tribes of Papua New Guinea. \"Formerly\" is the key word here.\n\nApparently, decades ago, Australian missionaries planted the the lost tribe thought in the mind of the Gogodala, and it strengthened over the years. Today there are many tribesmen who wear yarmulkes and prayer shawls, celebrate Jewish holidays, and learn Hebrew. Don't believe us? Here's a photo. Yes, that's the Israeli flag flying.\n\nThe Gogodala even asked researchers to take their DNA and hopefully trace it back to the Middle East. Results? Inconclusive.\n\nNow, we know they are no longer cannibals, but a note to those Jewish wannabe Gogondola:\n\nHumans are not Kosher.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('t/the_gogodala','gogodala');\n}",
