  "description": "One of our favorite Internet diversions is the Name of the Year bracket held annually every spring. The selection committee picks the 64 strangest, weirdest, most absurd names and lets the public vote for the best (worst?). This year's champion is Boats Botes. You can say that twice!\n\nPrevious champions include such marvels as Amanda Miranda Panda, Nohjay Nimpson, Destiny Frankenstein, and Vanilla Dong. And then there is the 2003 winner: Jew Don Boney. No, that's not a bad Jon Bon Jovi tribute band. (Are there any GOOD Jon Bon Jovi tribute bands? We leave that to you, dear reader.) He's an actual person, activist, reverend and politician, who served on the city council in Houston. Despite that fantastic name, Jew is clearly not a Jew.\n\nAnd there's more where that came from. Jew is actually a junior; his father, Jew Don Boney Sr, was a college president, and he has a son, Jew Don Boney III... Perhaps a prime candidate for an upcoming Name of the Year bracket?",
