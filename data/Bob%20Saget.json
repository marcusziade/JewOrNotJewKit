  "description": "Supposedly, Bob Saget is a dirty, vulgar comedian. But you wouldn't know it from his most-known work, \"Full House\" and \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", neither of which were dirty or vulgar, and definitely not comic. Unless you find humor in life lessons learned with a hug. Or are a big fan of getting hit in the groin. From ten different angles. With Bob Saget providing the narration.\n\nIt's really hard to get past those initial impressions when discussing Saget. For no matter how much you cringe at his stand-up act, an image keeps popping up. Bob is in a sweater vest, sitting at the end of a bed, having a heart-to-heart talk with one of his TV daughters. No matter how vulgar he tries to be, he can't conquer that image.\n\nOf course, if you take that image away, what's left? Just another dirty Jewish comedian who probably has no chance to be profiled on this website. So embrace your fatherly TV side, Bob. It got you on Jew or Not Jew.",
