  "description": "We recently read \"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live\". It's a pretty interesting look at the long-running TV show and the personalities behind it.\n\nAnd it is the personalities that are fascinating. The creative genius of Lorne Michaels, the brilliance of Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy, and Phil Hartman, the larger-than-life presence of John Belushi and Chris Farley...\n\nAnd the assholes. Or, there are some assholes. Chevy Chase, for one. The show's first breakthrough performer is universally hated. In fact, the book can just be renamed \"Live from New York: Why Everyone Associated with Saturday Night Live Hates Chevy Chase\".\n\nThat being said, Chase does not take #1 on the SNL asshole scale. At least with Chevy, you hear some backhanded compliments from former co-workers. Yes, he was an asshole, but he was a talented asshole.\n\nThat's not the case with Harry Shearer.\n\nThat's right, Harry Shearer, most known as the voice of Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, and others on \"The Simpsons\", and as one-third of Spinal Tap. Harry Shearer, who spent all of two years on SNL, with two completely different casts.\n\nAnd who, when given a chance to speak, is arrogant, egotistic, and dismissive of everyone else. And who, when others describe him, not a single positive word can be heard.\n\nAnd who, as he states himself, is a Jew.\n\nNo, seriously, can we have Chevy Chase instead?",
