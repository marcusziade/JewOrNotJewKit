  "description": "Chris Pratt has sure come a long way, and we're not talking about his turn as a sixth-billed lead on a middling sitcom. (Is six-billed even a lead?) We're talking about his turn with Jews for Jesus.\n\nAs the story goes, young Chris had lost his way. He was partying in Hawaii, hanging out by liquor stores, hoping that an adult would buy him alcohol. This is when he was approached by a stranger. (Oh-oh. Stranger stories never end well.) The stranger convinced young Chris to give up his wayward ways and join his organization... yes, Jews for Jesus. \"I'm not even sure, at that age,\" Pratt said, \"I knew what Jewish was.\" (Ahem, Chris, you would not have learned it from that guy.)\n\nChris spent two days stuffing envelopes, and then joined a church, and then was discovered by Hollywood, and then starred as that six-billed lead in \"Parks in Recreation\", and then (dot dot dot) \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Jurassic World\". So it all worked out for him. (We're willing to bet that stranger character is still trying to pick up dudes who are hanging out by liquor stores.)\n\nSeriously, don't talk to strangers by liquor stores!",
