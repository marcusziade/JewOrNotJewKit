  "description": "Richard Nixon had an enemies list: 20 people that were various reasons the president considered his political enemies.\n\nWho was on that list? Politicians, labor leaders, journalists, lawyers... as well as an advertising executive, a physics professor, a detective, and Paul Newman. Yes, THAT Paul Newman, who called being named to the list his greatest accomplishment (and that includes an Oscar and a line of delicious sauces!)\n\nJews? Oh, a bunch of the 20 were Jews, including #1 on the list. Yes, Nixon's enemies list was actually sequenced. Clearly, he put a lot of thought into it.\n\nThat #1 was Arnold Picker, a movie executive and liberal advocate. He was such an effective Democratic fundraiser that it catapulted him to the top of Nixon's hate.\n\nIsn't it nice that our country is no longer run by an insane lunatic?\n\nOh, wait.",
