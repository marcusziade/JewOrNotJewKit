  "description": "Love. This profile is going to be about love. Alert Hollywood screenwriters!\n\nIn 1905, young David Grun returns from Warsaw to hometown Plonsk. There, he meets his childhood friend, Rachel. David is smitten; the girl he once knew blossomed into a beautiful woman. Rachel is smitten as well... and so is her friend Sarah. Turns out David is quite a catch!\n\nWe're not sure what happened to the Sarah part of this love triangle, but David and Rachel move to Palestine. Soon, another woman emerges. Her name is Malke, who also falls for David. We have another triangle! Oh, that David Grun...\n\nA couple of years pass, and Rachel has had enough. David is not ready for marriage! David doesn't want children! David is too obsessed with his work! So she leaves him and marries someone else.\n\nSounds like a Hollywood script ready to happen! Kate Hudson as Rachel, no?",
