  "description": "Jeremy Strong, best-known for playing \"number one boy\" Kendall Roy on \"Succession\", was recently profiled in New Yorker magazine. The article turned many heads.\n\nOne thing the profile did not mention is that Strong is half Jewish, on his father's side. Instead, it went into detail into his method acting. \"To me, the stakes are life and death,\" Strong was quoted. \"I take [Kendall] as seriously as I take my own life.\"\n\nIt got curiouser and curiouser. When Strong's wife attempted to claim that he is a good husband, he rebuffed her. \"It does make me feel like I'm living a double life. At the time, I'm not sure which one is more real. Am I committing to the legend at home, where I'm the father and the husband, or the legend at work?\"\n\nAbsurd, isn't it? And yet, this method acting has propelled Strong to almost universal acclaim... at least from viewers, not so much from his co-workers. You could see how those who deal with him daily would not exactly appreciate this madness.\n\nUnless, you know, that New Yorker interview was just... an act?",
