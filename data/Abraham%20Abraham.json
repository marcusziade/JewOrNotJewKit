  "description": "\"Jews don't name their children after themselves\".\n\nIt's an adage we've repeated numerous times on our website. As a result, we've gotten numerous emails that claim that some Sephardi Jews name their children after themselves. Fine! Let that be the exception that proves the rule.\n\nHere's another exception: Sarah Sussman and Judah Abraham, Jewish emigrants from Bavaria, had a son born in 1843 New York. They named him, no, not Judah. Abraham, as in Abraham Abraham.\n\nThat son founded the department store Abraham \u0026 Straus, which thrived for over a century before being absorbed by Macy's. Still, Abraham Abraham...\n\nWhat a stupid name.\n\nJews are right not to name their children after themselves.",
