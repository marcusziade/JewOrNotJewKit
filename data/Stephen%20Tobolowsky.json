  "description": "If you google \"hardest working man in Hollywood\", you get a whole array of responses, who all supposedly can claim the title. And they all can be quickly dismissed.\n\nThere's Will Smith, who picks his roles so carefully as to not damage his image. There's Samuel L. Jackson, who appears in a lot of movies, but mails it in half the time. There's Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a good actor, but takes a lot of time off between his roles. There's Seth Rogen, and normally, we wouldn't argue against Seth Rogen, except...\n\nExcept the hardest working man in Hollywood is Stephen Tobolowsky.\n\nWho? What has he been in?\n\nThe better question is what HASN'T he been in. The ultimate \"Hey, it's THAT guy!\", as of this writing, Tobolowsky's resume has 208 roles (by comparison, the supposedly-busy Samuel L. lags far behind at 138). In movies, he's been in everything from \"Spaceballs\" to \"Sneakers\" to \"Groundhog Day\" (Ned Ryerson!) to \"The Insider\" to \"Memento\" to \"Garfield\" (sigh). On TV, Tobolowsky ranges from \"Seinfeld\" to \"Deadwood\" to \"Heroes\" to \"Glee\". He's one busy, busy, hard-working man.\n\nOne busy, busy, hard-working Jew.",
