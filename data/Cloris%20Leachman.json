  "description": "Cloris Leachman sure has resurrected her career recently. She participated on \"Dancing with the Stars\", made out with Jack Black in a bring-out-the-stars episode of \"The Office\", and is now due to appear in Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\". Playing a Jew, of course.\n\nWhat else would you expect from a long-time Mel Brooks collaborator? Sure, Cloris did play a obvious non-Jew in \"Young Frankenstein\" (Frau Blucher â€” neigh), but she must be Jewish, right?\n\nWrong. She was born and raised in the goy fields of Iowa. But why not let Cloris speak for herself? \"I'm not Jewish but they cast me that way a lot of the time,\" she says.\n\nWell, that explains that.\n\nMaking out with Jack Black? We're still scratching our heads over that one.",
