  "description": "We're sure that Barbara Boxer has had her share of tough debates during her political career. She has served the people of California for close to three decades, first in the House, then in the Senate. Yet she keeps on, combining forces with Dianne Feinstein to create a formidable block of Jewish California female Senators. So that's nice.\n\nSo G-d only knows how many politicians passed through the Capitol's doors during Boxer's tenure. And G-d only knows how often she had to take the floor to debate an opponent. And G-d only knows how many times her voice rang through the halls of Congress, fighting for her constituents, fighting for what she believes is right.\n\nWhat we do know is not every Senator would go on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and take the pro stance in a debate with Larry David on the merits of stealing clothes from dry cleaners.\n\nAnd that takes some chutzpah.",
