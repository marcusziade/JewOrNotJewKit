  "description": "We like soccer here at JONJ, as you can probably tell from the disproportionate amount of soccer profiles. And we're always looking to add a new one, but the problem is, how do we add a profile of someone the general public is probably ignorant of, when we haven't even profiled such better-known Jewish athletes as Sandy Koufax?\n\nBut when United States beats Mexico yet again, this time to win the Gold Cup (and with it, the championship of North America), and the game-winning goal is scored... by a Jew, we not only take notice, but gladly profile that Jew on our website. So here we go, Benny Feilhaber, a Brazilian-born American kid who currently plays his pro soccer in Germany... And one of the best emerging soccer talents in America today.\n\nFeilhaber's paternal grandfather escaped Austria in the 30s, settling in Brazil. And although Benny's mother's side is not Jewish, he respects his heritage, celebrating Jewish holidays and playing in the Maccabiah games.\n\nSo hooray for Jewish soccer players! Jonathan Bornstein, you are next.",
