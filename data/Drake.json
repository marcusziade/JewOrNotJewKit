  "description": "The Grammy Awards are coming up, and we're actually going to pay attention. No, not because of the award for Best Klezmer Performance, that category has been sadly discontinued (besides, everyone knows that as far as klezmer goes, no one is a match for Harvey's Hebrew Hipsters).\n\nNo, we're actually interested in the categories for rap. Yes, you heard us right, RAP. Aubrey Drake Graham, AKA Drake, supposedly the hot new name in the genre, is going up against such giants as Eminem and Jay-Z in the best Rap Song and best Rap Solo Performance categories.\n\nWould we be surprised if he wins? Absolutely. And no, not because Drake is Jewish (even bar mitzvahed). Ever heard of the Beastie Boys? Jews practically invented rap.\n\nNo, we would be surprised because Drake is... Canadian. Seriously, a Canadian with a chance to be named the best rapper? What's the world coming to?",
