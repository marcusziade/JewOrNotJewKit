  "description": "You can kinda understand Jemima Kirke's parents. Kinda.\n\nAfter all, they are a diverse bunch. Her father, a British rock drummer. Her mother, a daughter of a Jewish British tycoon of Iraqi descent and an Israeli. They probably just wanted to give their daughter an exotic name. They did name one of her sisters Domino... (The other is Lola. They can't be all winners.)\n\nBesides, we can't imagine pancake syrup being popular on the other side of the pond. In fact, we're pretty sure that our British readers are currently scratching their heads. Pancake syrup? Why pancake syrup? And what does it have to do with Jemima Kirke?\n\nWell, British readers, we will leave it up to you to look up pancake syrup, Aunt Jemima, and the latter's racial connotations. Needless to say that in America, the name Jemima hasn't exactly been used much over the past century.\n\nSo you can give a pass to Jemima's parents. Without knowing the backstory, it doesn't exactly sound like a bad name. And it does come from the Hebrew \"Yemima\" for \"dove\". So there's that.\n\nBut then, can you imagine if her sisters have children and Jemima becomes an aunt? And if she marries someone named Ben?\n\nLook that one up, British readers.",
