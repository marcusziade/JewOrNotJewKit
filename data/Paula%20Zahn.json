  "description": "Where can you find Paula Zahn, the morning news anchor CNN once promoted as \"provocative, super-smart, oh yeah, and just a little sexy?\"\n\nPerhaps, your local synagogue? \"Zahn\" could be Jewish, right?\n\nClose, but no cigar. It is quite possible that Paula Zahn has attended synagogue, doing so with her husband, Richard Cohen. But since the two have now divorced and she never converted to Judaism, it's hard to imagine her returning.\n\nSo seriously, where do you find Paula Zahn these days? Now that CNN has fired her, will she continue her meteoric rise or fade into obscurity?\n\nOh, she just got a job at PBS. Obscurity it is.",
