  "description": "Here's another rule we subscribe to at Jew or Not Jew: The New York Jewish Athlete Lemma. The rule states that if a New York athlete is even remotely Jewish, that fact will become immediately known.\n\nWhy? Well, there are a lot of Jews in and around New York. Specifically, there are a lot of Jews in the New York sports media. When they smell a Jew, they pounce. Oh, do they ever. (Also, when they smell a free lunch buffet. But that's a story for another time.)\n\nNowhere has the lemma been more evident than with the newest New York Met, Ike Davis. Once the media got a whiff that Ike stood for Isaac, it didn't take long for the truth to come out. (Of course, here at Jew or Not Jew we knew the truth long before Ike made the majors. Ordinarily, we would have waited for Ike to establish himself to write his profile. But when, after less than a week in the majors, he gets compared by that New York media to Ted Williams... Yes, TED WILLIAMS! Are they serious?)\n\nSo yes, Davis is Jewish â€” Halachically, through his mother. He is proud of his heritage, calls himself \"culturally Jewish\", and even through he is not looking to promote his background, we're pretty sure the Mets will do their best to cash in on it. Perhaps a joint Ike Davis bobblehead / gefilte fish giveaway night?\n\nWe're sure the New York sports media would enjoy that one.",
