  "description": "So, Britain has a new Prime Minister. After 14 years of Tory rule, Labour finally took over. And it's not Jeremy Corbyn, who recently led the party, but was ousted and suspended for antisemitism. So that's good.\n\nThe new PM is Keir Starmer, who obviously comes with the question... (Well, a question other than \"What kind of a name is Keir?\" It either comes from the surname Kerr, or is Gaelic for \"dark, swarthy\". Good to know.)\n\nNo, Starmer is not Jewish, but his wife and kids are! Mrs. Starmer's name is Victoria Alexander, and her father was a Polish Jew.\n\nWhich brings us to another question... what do you call the spouse of the Prime Minister? It's not \"first lady\", right? Wikipedia has it under \"spouse of the prime minister of the United Kingdom\". Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.\n\nBack to Starmer: we can't claim to know much about British politics, but the Tories did seem to really mess it up over the last decade and a half. So let's hope that the new guys can turn it around... Is it that hard to have competent national leadership?\n\n(Looking at America and shutting up.)",
