  "description": "If you think back to high school chemistry, you might remember that the first column of the Periodic Table is made up of metals. There is one exception: pesky hydrogen, element #1. It's obviously a gas.\n\nWell, recently scientists at Harvard did something about it. They used something called a diamond anvil cell (sounds expensive) to create metallic hydrogen. Interestingly, its existence was first predicted in 1935, by Hungarian scientist, Jeno (Eugene) Wigner.\n\nWigner was Jewish, of course. Strangely, his family decided to convert to Lutheranism not for religious purposes, but as opposition to Hungary's Jew-filled communist regime. Go figure. Still, with Wigner winning the Nobel in 1963 and his foresight for metallic hydrogen (82 years in the making!), we're not gonna harp on this conversion.\n\nSo now hydrogen can be a metal! Take that, high school chemistry!",
