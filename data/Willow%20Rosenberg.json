  "description": "Waaaaaaay back when everyone thought the Internet was just a fad, there was a movie (starring Kristy Swanson and, ugh, Luke Perry, not Jews) called Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This led to two important results: First, America succumbed to the terrible urge to drop the \"S\" from the title and make vampire-themed porn. Second, it led to the creation of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show.\n\nAnd, remarkably, Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show was actually GOOD. Really, really good. Best-show-on television-that-people-with-boyfriends/girlfriends/spouses-weren't- watching good.\n\nWe've already profiled the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar (who played the goyishe, titular Buffy), so all of this would just be fan service except for one thing: Willow Rosenberg.\n\nWillow, for those of you who were dating at the time, began the series as Buffy's mousy best friend and eventually turned into an all-powerful magic wielding (and occasionally evil) powerhouse with one of the most believable gay relationships on television.\n\nJust to repeat: Willow Rosenberg is the Jewish, lesbian wiccan from  Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show.\n\nG-d bless Joss Whedon. \n\nReally.",
