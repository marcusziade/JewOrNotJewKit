  "description": "If you're Jewish, American, and over the age of 60, you fall into one of the following categories:\n\n1. You live in the state of Florida.\n2. You are planning to live in the state of Florida.\n3. You wish you could live in the state of Florida, but do not want to leave your grandchildren behind.\n\nThere really is no fourth alternative.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that the first Jewish senator in American history, David Levy, was elected from that state of Florida.\n\n(OK, so he then changed his name and converted to Christianity. We're not gonna judge. It must have been tough being the only Jew in such a WASP club that the Senate was. OK, we'll judge. Just a little.)\n\nStill, we'll applaud him for being such a trailblazer, the first in the line of many Jews that helped turn Florida into Jew Heaven.\n\nWe'll be 60 one day, after all.",
