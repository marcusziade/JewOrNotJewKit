  "description": "Usually, when we lose a Jew to another religion, we don't make a fuss. They want to leave? They want to find answers elsewhere? Fine.\n\nAnd we're definitely not making a fuss about the departure of journalist Robert Novak. Born a Jew, he converted to Catholicism in the 80s.\n\nIn fact, with Novak, we're more than glad to be rid of him. Why? Well, let us count the ways... His alleged role in the the Orlando Letelier assassination. His outright hatred of Israel (textbook example of a self-loathing Jew).\n\nEven without those other transgressions, his outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame would be reason enough.\n\nSo enjoy Catholicism, douchebag. Good fucking riddance.",
