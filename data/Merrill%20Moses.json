  "description": "Allow us to be a little sophomoric here. Just a tad.\n\nHere is our chance to discuss another Jewish Olympian, the goalkeeper for the US water polo team, Merrill Moses (silver medalist in 2008), and all we can think about is... pee.\n\nThese are water polo players. They are in the water for a rather long time. Yes, there are substitutions (although not so much for goalies), but you'd think that nature has no choice but call now and again. Hell, soccer players sometimes go on the field. And you're in the water, so it's not like anyone will see or care, because, face it, everyone is doing it, so why not just relax and let it flow and...\n\nOK, fine. Enough about that. So here is another question about water polo... why do some players wear two bathing suits?\n\nOh. It's because water polo tends to get physical and sometimes a suit gets pulled off, so a player doesn't want to expose his private area.\n\nEspecially if he is peeing at the time!\n\nSorry for being so sophomoric...",
