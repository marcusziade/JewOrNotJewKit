  "description": "Why were Tarzan movies banned in Nazi Germany? There are a few theories...\n\n#1: The Nazis thought the movies were pornographic, not liking how few clothes were worn, especially by women.\n\n#2: The Nazis didn't like how some of the movies portrayed Germans as villains.\n\n#3: The Nazis thought that Tarzan star, former Olympic swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller, was Jewish.\n\nNo one knows what was the real reason, but we're really hoping it was #3. You see, Weissmuller wasn't Jewish. He was a goyishe GERMAN.\n\nStupid Nazis.",
