But we're not getting into rabbinical semantics here. You're not supposed to say it because of the \"don't say G-d's name in vain\" commandment. We're not sure if a snarky Jewish website qualifies.\n\nNo, the snarky Jewish website is here to discuss French Olympic handball(!) player Elohim Prandi. Yeah, not exactly a name you hear often. \"I don't know any others [Elohims],\" Prandi says. We don't either! Well, except that one that shouldn't be named...\n\nNo, he is not Jewish. Prandi's parents just liked the name. And he likes the fact that it's an \"unknown first name that [can't] be read on every page!\"\n\nWell, except in that one book that we read in Hebrew school...",
