  "description": "Face it: Jewish last names are hard to pronounce. Even the ones that seem easy on paper, often create a lot of confusion.\n\nTake the newest recipient of the JONJ perfect score, famed conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, for instance. What is the correct pronunciation? Is it \"Burn\"-\"steen\"? Is it \"Bern\"-\"stine\"? The former is the one you usually hear. The latter is the one he supposedly used himself.\n\nOr perhaps, it's the original European pronunciation, \"Behrn\"-\"shteyn\"?\n\nAnd you know what? We're fine with the confusion. Keeps the goyim on their toes.\n\nAnd no, this profile is not autobiographical. Not at all.",
