  "description": "Let's look in our mailbox, shall we? Here's a letter from a reader in Nevada, who...\n\nOh crap. OH CRAP!\n\nWARNING: the following contains a spoiler for Season 2 of \"The Boys\"\n\n... who asks as to profile Aya Cash, who \"plays a Nazi supervillain on The Boys\". Crap!\n\nWe just started to get into \"The Boys\" and barely got to Cash's character, who is... what? A Nazi supervillain? But she appears to be so cool, other than that name of hers... Stormfront. Oh, right, Stormfront. Like that antisemitic website. Seems pretty obvious now.\n\nIn any case, Aya Cash is Jewish on her father's side, self-indentifies as a Jew, and yes, plays Stormfront, a Nazi supervillain on \"The Boys\".\n\nThanks, reader from Nevada...",
