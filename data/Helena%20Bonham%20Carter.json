  "description": "It's been a while since we looked in our mailbox. Today's letter comes from a reader from London, who, together with her \"weirdly obtuse boyfriend\", is a fan of our website. The reader tells us that it \"would be nice to have some British women represented here\".\n\nAu contraire, dear Londonette! We do have a number of British women represented! Let's see, there's Kate Middleton, and... ummm... Amy Winehouse, and... well, Jordan, of course!\n\nOn second thought, our correspondent does have a point. Is that the best we can do for British Jewesses (or Not Jewesses)? A princely girlfriend, a crack whore, and a \"glamour\" model? That's the front page your basic English tabloid, not a representation of the fine women of Great Britain.\n\nSo let's profile Helena Bonham Carter, terrific actress, Tim Burton's muse, and at least 3/8 Jewish. That definitely beats a \"glamour\" model, doesn't it? And Helena has great pedigree as well: her half-Jewish grandfather, Spanish diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejon, helped thousands of Jews escape France during World War II.\n\nSo there you go, dear correspondent. Now, as for your boyfriend, you're on your own there...",
