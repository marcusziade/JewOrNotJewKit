  "description": "You can find anything on the internet. Let's take genealogy. Say, if you wanted to know who Bill Clinton's maternal grandparents were; the answer it's right there, Eldridge Cassidy and Edith Grisham. Hell, if you wanted, you can find out about his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents. We are not kidding. But face it, we're not that interested in Bill Clinton's family history. Nothing remotely Jewish there.\n\nOf course, that doesn't stop us from browsing other genealogies of non-Jews, hoping to find a Katz, a Cohen, an Abramowicz... And nothing.\n\nWe looked through politicians. WASP City. We looked through celebrities. More diversity, still no Jews. The best we could do were the great-grandparents of Guns N' Roses front man Axl Rose, Henry Rosenbrock and Anna Zimmerman. Who, despite those names, were goyishe Germans, not Jews.\n\nNow, if this was someone talented or important, we'd be more than happy to argue about potential Jewishness. But for Axl Rose? Sadly, pseudo-Jewish names, three generations ago, are just not good enough.",
