  "description": "So, Jewish parents, do you want your children to win a Nobel Prize? Of course, you do! But which field should you steer them into?\n\nDon't fret, we're here to help. After spending a long night with our abacuses, counting and re-counting (they don't give a Nobel for math, after all), we have our answer.\n\nNow, what makes the problem a little more difficult is that single Nobels are often split between multiple people. So what we did is count all individual winners, then counted the Jews (considering the world's Jewish population, there are A LOT of Jews), and came up with a percentage. These figures are not exact... alright, alright, we'll get to the point!\n\nLiterature, alas, is not exactly full of Jews, coming in at 12%. But then, have you actually read these Literature laureates? Exactly.\n\nChemistry is at 20%. Physics and Medicine hover at 26%. Our winner is Economics: an astonishing 35% of Economics Nobel laureates have been Jews. Perhaps none more worthy than Milton Friedman, winner in 1976, named by The Economist \"the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century\".\n\nOh, right, we forgot the Peace prize. Ummmm... Let's just stick to the other five, OK?",
