  "description": "Things haven't been looking too good lately for Israel.\n\nOK, to some extent, things are never looking too good for Israel. The Jewish homeland is essentially on the volcanic summit of the most violent place on Earth. \n\nDo we think it's all going to dreck? Probably not. And, truly, do Israelis care what a couple of American komikers think of their country? Not even a little bit. But we worry.\n\nSo, when Sweet Genius and solid 3/3/5 on OstrichOrNotOstrich.com (OONO!) Chef Ron Ben-Israel says on a recent show that, if everyone baked, we would have world peace... well... we kinda gotta think about that, don't we?\n\nIf all the generals traded their tanks for trays, their uzis for icing, wouldn't that be a better world? Sure we'd be trading death by bullets for death by diabetes, but it would make the evening news a lot less depressing.\n\nPicture a Nobel Peace Prize handed to 12 morbidly obese delegates, still licking their fingers as they accept their award, knowing that, finally, Jews and Arabs, Christians and Muslims, Koreans (North) and Koreans (South) could live together fearing nothing more than an argument over who gets the big purple sugar flower.\n\nAt least until someone declared they preferred chocolate over vanilla and then it would be the whole world to hell in a hand basket all over again...",
