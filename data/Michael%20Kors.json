  "description": "A recent Jeopardy answer (question?) identified \"Karl Anderson Jr\" as the real name of fashion designer Michael Kors. That got us a big confused. We assumed that \"Michael Kors\" wasn't his real name. He is a fashion designer, after all, but we would think that he changed it from something Jewy? The Ralph Lifshitz -\u003e Ralph Lauren case, if you will.\n\nAs it turns out, \"Michael Kors\" is, in fact, Michael Kors' real name... but it's not exactly his birth name, which is that aforementioned Karl Anderson Jr. His father was Swedish; his mother was a Jewish fashion model with the delightful name of Joan Hamburger. When his parents divorced, Joan married Bill Kors and changed her name. Young Karl tagged along, and he even got to chose a a new first name as well!\n\nImagine you're five years old and get to chose your own name! Let's just say that results could be somewhat out there, and might involve a bunch of bodily functions. Somehow, young Karl settled on \"Michael\". We're going to assume his mother had veto power.\n\nIn any case, Michael Kors became one of the most famous fashion designers in the world, with his name slapped on everything from clothes to handbags to watches to fragrance. \"Michael Kors\" is somewhat tidier brand name than \"Karl Anderson Jr\" would be, isn't it?",
