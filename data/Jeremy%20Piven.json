  "description": "As an actor, Jeremy Piven has a lot of range. In \"PCU\", he played the ultimate college slacker. In \"Old School\", he played a crusty college dean.\n\nIn \"Keeping Up with the Steins\", Piven played a powerful Hollywood agent, hellbent on giving his daughter the most extravagant bat mitzvah imaginable. On \"Entourage\", he plays a powerful Hollywood agent, hellbent on giving his son the most extravagant bar mitzvah imaginable.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't sound right... let us check IMDB for a moment. Yeah, we have the mitzvahs reversed. Piven had a son in \"Steins\", and a daughter on \"Entourage\". There's that range that we talked about!\n\nBut that's all right with us. So what that his old range is missing and he's being typecast as the Jewish Hollywood type! There are many worse options than him. We're looking at you, Pauly Shore.",
