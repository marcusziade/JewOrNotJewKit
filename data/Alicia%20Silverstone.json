  "description": "Ten years ago, Alicia Silverstone was on top of the world. Today, she seems to be falling into obscurity. But here at Jew or Not Jew, we don't discriminate against fallen Hollywood royalty; sure, we'll make fun of them, but in the case where the person's Jewishness is a proven fact, we'd still give them a high enough score. See: Guttenberg, Steve. See: Ryder, Winona.\n\nSo this would usually be the space where we'd make fun of Alicia. Except... it's pretty hard to make fun of her. She doesn't possess Guttenberg's lameness or Ryder's kleptomania. In fact, it's pretty amazing how she went from being one of the most sought-after young stars to failed TV sitcoms in a few years. Was it \"Batman and Robin\" that doomed her? But then, George Clooney did manage to survive that debacle.\n\nSo we're gonna let you off the hook, Alicia. Having another website lampooning your career will just be a drop in the ocean. So instead, we'll focus on your Jewishness, and since you was raised in a traditional household and seem to be very proud of your heritage, we'll look past the latter years of your career. It could definitely be worse. See: Guttenberg, Steve. See: Ryder, Winona.",
