Jose Pekerman didn't do too shabby either. The descendant of Jewish Ukrainian immigrants was named national coach in 2004 after leading his country to an astonishing three Youth World Cup titles.\n\nWhat is the worst job in Argentina?\n\nWell, the coach of the national soccer team, of course! In most countries, making the quarterfinal of the World Cup is a dream. In Argentina, however, anything but the title is a disappointment, so Pekerman had no choice but to resign after losing to Germany in 2006. He did land on his feet, however, and is now in charge of the Colombian national team.\n\nWhat is the best job in Colombia?",
