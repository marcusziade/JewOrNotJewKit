  "description": "All of the sudden, we've been bombarded with requests to profile some guy we've never heard of: a French dude named Gabriel Attal. From the looks of it, he is a member of a boy band? We're gonna have to look him up.\n\nSo, yeah, this Attal guy is a member of something called \"Renaissance\" and is half Jewish: his father had Jewish ancestry from all over Europe and even northern Africa. However, Gabriel was raised in his goyishe mother's Orthodox Christian religion. Look at us doing research!\n\nApparently, this \"Renaissance\" is quite popular in France, but why all the recent profile requests? Oh. Turns out it's not a boy band, but a political party. On January 9, 2024, Gabriel Attal became the Prime Minister of France. That'll teach us to proclaim our ignorance! Boy band! As! If!\n\nAt the age of 34, Attal is the youngest ever French PM, and the first openly gay one. It also means that we have profiled five French prime ministers with various levels of Jewishness... and still, not a single French boy band member.\n\nProbably for the best.",
