Regardless of the movie, the character is always the same: curly black wig, tracksuit, gold necklace. We first met him in \"Road Trip\":\n\n\n\nThis is Todd trying to suck on the feet of sleeping Amy Smart. Yes, the necklace is a Star of David.\n\nHere he is in \"Old School\":\n\n\n\nHis one line? \"I'm here for the gangbang.\" The necklace has changed to a Chai, but the spirit is the same.\n\nWe move on to \"The Hangover\", his first job with Galifianakis.\n\n\n\nYou can't see the necklace that well, but, trust us, the Chai is there. To get the context of the scene, here's Todd a couple of seconds before (they are in an elevator):\n\n\n\nAnd then we have \"Due Date\", with Galifianakis again:\n\n\n\nThe tracksuit is replaced by an equally-creepy bathrobe, and the look on Juliette Lewis' face says it all.
