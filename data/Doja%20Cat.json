  "description": "There is no hidden meaning in this profile. There is no irony, there is no sarcasm. Do not read between the lines. There are no lines.\n\n\"Bitch, I'm a cow / Bitch, I'm a cow / I'm not a cat\"\n\nSorry, these are lines. These are the opening lines to \"Mooo!\" by Doja Cat, the \"song of the summer\", the \"single of the millennium\".\n\n\"I go 'Mooo' (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow) / Mooo (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow)\"\n\nThat's the chorus. You want more? There is more.\n\n\"Suck a n**** dick or somethin', E-I-O\"\n\nYou know what? That's enough. G-d almighty, that is enough. THIS is what you are listening too, America? This is what you call music?\n\nYeah, we get it. We are old men who are out of touch. Our taste in music is not exactly exquisite. But you know that? We tried to listen to it, and felt our brain cells melting away by the second. This \"Mooo!\" is absolute, dreadful, abominable piece of shit, and anyone who enjoys listening to it is a fucking idiot.\n\nHow is that for a line?",
