  "description": "\"The Big Bang Theory\" recently announced that it will end after a 12 year run, meaning we better profile Melissa Rauch before she slips into inevitable irrelevance that all sitcom stars seem destined for...\n\nYou know what's also turning 12? Our website! Yes, it's now bat mitzvah age! (We realize some Jews celebrate bat mitzvah at 13, but let's not get involved in that discussion...)\n\nOf course, we can't claim as much cultural relevance as TBBT, but we think we've made some kind of mark. If anyone wants to know if their favorite celebrities, historical obscurities, and fictional characters are Jewish, we've now been in the business for 12 years!\n\nAs for Rauch, yes, Jewish, and bat mitzvahed and all! (Her bat mitzvah theme: Melissa's Comedy Club. It's not the worst one we've ever heard.)\n\nWe just hope WE don't slip into inevitable irrelevance after we decide to end our run, whenever that'll be...",
