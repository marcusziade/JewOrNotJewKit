  "description": "\"There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.\" â€” Helena Rubinstein\n\nIn the late 19th century, a young Helena (then still Chaya) Rubinstein emigrated from Poland to Australia in order to escape an arranged marriage. She was quickly noticed on the new continent, for her lack of money couldn't mask her beauty and style.\n\nIt was her beauty cream, Helena said. It came from the Carpathian mountains and made the skin silky-smooth. In reality, it came from lanolin, or wool wax, which came from sheep so abundant in Australia. Helena figured out a way to mask its nasty smell.\n\nFrom there, a beauty empire grew. Helena took it to London, then to New York, quite possibly becoming the world's first female self-made millionaire. She sold her company in 1928... then bought it back for pennies on the dollar after the stock market crash, and blew it up into a huge conglomerate. Later on, her foundation made much of PBS children's programming possible.\n\nHelena Rubinstein was anything but lazy.",
