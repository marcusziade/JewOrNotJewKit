  "description": "Former Detroit Lions quarterback Karl Sweetan holds an unbreakable NFL record. It literally can't be broken.\n\nTo be fair, Sweetan shares the record with such luminaries as Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Tom Brady (and also Gus Frerotte, so not exactly a company of all-time greats â€” did we just inadvertently put Eli on that list?).\n\nSweetan threw the longest pass in NFL history: 99 yards. That's why it can't be bettered: the field is obviously 100 yards, and there is no 0 yard line. So 99 is as far as you can go. (People north of the border: we understand that your football field is 110 yards. Good on you!)\n\nThis was actually Sweetan's first NFL touchdown. The Lions lost the game, 45:14. (If that doesn't summarize the Lions experience, we don't know what does.)\n\nSweetan played just five years in the NFL, retiring with little accolades outside of that record. He does, however, hold another distinction: an NFL quarterback with Jewish and Native American roots.\n\nA record less likely to be matched than the 99-yard pass!",
