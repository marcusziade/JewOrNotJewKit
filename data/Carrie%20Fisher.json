  "description": "We're pretty eh about Carrie Fisher here at JONJ.\n\nExcept for a few random appearances, she's been more or less MIA for the past 19 years. And unless you're really into celebrities whining about how \"Daddy didn't love me\", there's not much to say about her writing either.\n\nOnly her father's side is Jewish and Fisher describes herself as agnostic, which means she's a Jew only compared to bottom feeder wannabes like Madonna and the recently ridiculed Rosie O'Donnell.\n\nIn fact, except for one iconic role as nerd goddess Princess Leia, we probably wouldn't even be wasting our time with her. And even then, she's probably the weakest of the big 4 (Luke, Han, Leia, Vader). Heck we could make an argument that even Chewbacca was more interesting and...\n\nOh, who are we kidding. The woman wore a gold metal bikini for about five minutes of screen time and we STILL can't get it out of our heads.\n\nAfter you do that, everything else is just water under the bridge.",
