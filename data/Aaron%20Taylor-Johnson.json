  "description": "Hey, six-year-old, you want to go to the movies today?\n\nWhat are we going to see?\n\nAvengers! You know, all the superheroes!\n\nI want to go!\n\nWell, one thing: it's two and a half hours long.\n\nI don't want to go.\n\nYou're sure?\n\nSure. It's too long to sit in the movie theater!\n\nYou see, movie studios? The kid made a smart decision. He doesn't care about Scarlett Johansson in a tight leather suit (yet). He doesn't care that Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the actor who plays new addition Quicksilver, is Jewish. And as much as he likes superheroes, he understands that being cooped up in a movie theater for two and a half hours (plus the previews!) is just too damn long.\n\nWe'll wait for the DVD. At least we can pause it.",
