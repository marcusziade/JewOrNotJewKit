  "description": "Spam wasn't invented by Jews. The first recorded incident was by someone named Gary Thuerk, who, in 1978, sent the same message to 393 ARPANET users. (Err... ARPANET was the precursor to the Internet.) That's 393, not 393 thousand. Many of those 393 were pissed.\n\nWe would have to wait until 1994 for spam to take the form that we know today. Then, a lawyer husband-and-wife team, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, Jews, posted an ad for their service to over 5000 newsgroups. (Err... newsgroups were like Reddit of the early 90s. Ask your parents?) Newsgroup readers were pissed.\n\nBut you know what? The spam worked! Canter and Siegel's message, advertising green card lottery services, banked them $100,000 in revenue, at a very minimal cost. The two tried to parlay that success into a spam-for-hire business and books. Canter was eventually disbarred... for illegal advertising practices.\n\nAnd, while we're at it, Jews did not invent SPAM either. It was invented by Jay Hormel of Hormel Corporation, as a way to sell unused pieces of pork shoulder. Delicious? You tell us!",
