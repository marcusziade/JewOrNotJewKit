  "description": "We never understood all the fuss about Fanny Brice. You know, Fanny, the titular \"Funny Girl\" in the musical from the 1960s that made Barbra Streisand into a star. (Here half our audience nods vigorously, while another half leaves for a Reddit thread about NFTs. Good riddance! Where were we?)\n\nSo, yeah, Fanny Brice, a somewhat obscure Jewish actress/comedian whose legacy continues to live on because she was somehow picked to be the subject of the musical which somehow became a huge hit (you have Miss Streisand to thank for that, Fanny) which somehow stays relevant to this day.\n\nAnd boy, does it stay relevant! You don't need to follow the Broadway gossip mill (and G-d forbid, we don't follow the Broadway gossip mill) to know that there is something up with \"Funny Girl\". It took almost 60 years to bring it back to Broadway, pretty much because no one has the pipes to measure up to dear old Babs. And when they did... boy, it did not go well.\n\nThe role was first given to Beanie Feldstein, but the reviews were pretty horrid, which sent the Broadway gossip mill (we swear, we don't follow it!) into overdrive. So Feldstein either quit, or was fired, or both. She was replaced by Lea Michele, who comes with her own baggage (but definitely can sing better than Feldstein), and, honestly, if you want to read more about all the controversies, there are better places than the humble pages of Jew or Not Jew.\n\nHonestly, we don't understand what the fuss is all about.",
