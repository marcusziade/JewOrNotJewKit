  "description": "A very Jewy role just might result in an Oscar statue.\n\nYou see, Jesse Eisenberg directed a movie, \"A Real Pain\", about finding Jewish roots in Poland. It's a very important film for Eisenberg, whose Jewish Polish background is shared with the character of David, whom he plays in the movie.\n\nSo David and his cousin Benji tour Poland and try to learn where their grandmother came from. In an incredibly poignant scene, they visit Majdanek concentration camp, the first time a movie was allowed to film there. It truly is a nice film, and quite important in these... troubled times that sadly often mirror the rise of Nazism. And it has a wonderful performance from Kieran Culkin in the lead role.\n\nYes, we said it. The lead role! Culkin is the one who is in the most scenes. Culkin is the one who drives the plot. The movie is a showcase for Culkin!\n\nAnd you know what you are about to say...\n\nWhy did Culkin get nominated for best SUPPORTING actor?!",
