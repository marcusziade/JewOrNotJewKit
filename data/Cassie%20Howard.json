  "description": "The most unbelievable thing on \"Euphoria\" is not the preteen drug dealer, or the amount of penis that can fit an hour-long show (there is a lot of penis), or a high school allowing a student to stage an independent play with Broadway-quality production values...\n\nThe most unbelievable thing on \"Euphoria\" is that Cassie Howard is Jewish. Yes, the character pictured on the left here, played by the incredibly goyishe (and now Emmy-nominated for the role) Sydney Sweeney. Jewish.\n\nNo, this is not Jew or Not Jew trying to apply the James Wilson Law for the umpteenth time with little basis. This is plainly stated by Cassie's sister Lexi: their mother is Jewish. Now, Lexi is played by Maude Apattow, daughter of Judd, making her a rather believable Jew. Cassie, on the other hand...\n\nPerhaps the most unbelievable on \"Euphoria\" is that these two are supposed to be sisters?\n\nfunction flip() {\n remember();\n}\nfunction flip2() {\n memorize();\n setImage('lexi_howard');\n setRatings(3, 4, 3);\n setTitle('Lexi Howard');\n}",
