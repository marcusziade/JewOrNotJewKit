  "description": "A few years ago, FOX broadcast a series of \"Magic Secrets Revealed\", where a masked magician took the viewers behind the scenes of illusions. The magic community (we're picturing a bunch of guys in black robes and pointy hats) was up in arms, as if their secrets were on the level of those of national security.\n\nWell, there is one secret that the masked magician couldn't reveal, because only two people in the world know how it's done. One is David Berglas, from whom the illusion gets its name, \"The Berglas Effect\". The other is Berglas' apprentice.\n\nThe illusion has another name, \"Any Card at Any Number\". It involves one audience member being given a deck of cards, another picking a random card, and the third one picking a random number. Then, the first participant counts off to the selected number... coming up with the selected card. We know what you're thinking: that the audience members are in on it. They are not.\n\nBerglas' life story is fascinating as well: his family escaped Nazi Germany to avoid persecution, ending up in England. During the war, he worked in France as a secret agent for the US government, and then consulted on various films, including Tim Burton's \"Batman\" and various James Bond vehicles. All that while coming up with the most unbreakable magic trick of all time.\n\nTake that, masked magician.",
