  "description": "A long time ago, before our website had a suggestion box (yes, there was such a time!) we received out first ever suggestion email. Actually, \"a long time ago\" can be quantified: Jew or Not Jew is turning 11 today, so this came a tad after that.\n\nThe exact wording of the email is now lost, but it came on the heels of back-to-back-to-back profiles of Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Alicia Silverstone, and boiled down to the following: \"Are you guys serious? Is this all a colossal joke? And, if this is not a joke, you need to profile more important Jewish women, such as the artist Judy Chicago.\"\n\nDear correspondent from back in 2006! You have probably forgotten about that email, but we have not! So, here she is: Judy Chicago.\n\nBorn Judith Cohen in (would you have guessed it... Detroit! We kid, we kid...) Chicago, she is an important contemporary artist who specializes in so-called \"feminist art\". Her most-known piece is \"The Dinner Party\", an installation of 39 set pieces that depict the dinner plates of 39 women from history, from Ishtar to Judith to Elizabeth I to Susan B. Anthony, and features a lot of... vaginas and vulvae. Jewish? Of course, Jewish. Her father came from a line of 23 rabbis!\n\nDear correspondent, we're not sure if you ever came back to our website, but we hope this is not the case of too little, too late.\n\nAs for us being a colossal joke...\n\n11 years have passed, but we're still not sure.",
