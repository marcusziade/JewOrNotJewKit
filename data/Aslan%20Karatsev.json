  "description": "A new player just burst on the tennis scene. He is part Jewish, with Israeli ties and Russian roots... Wait, didn't we already profile him? Denis Shapovalov, right?\n\nNot just Shapovalov, apparently. There is also Aslan Karatsev, who came from nowhere (world #114) to the semifinal of the Australian Open. He's since won a tournament, beat Novak Djokovic on the Serb's home court, and rose into the top 30.\n\nJust like with Shapovalov, we can't exactly claim Karatsev. He is only a quarter Jewish, but did spend his formative years in Israel after his family emigrated from Russia. At the age of 12, they moved back to the home country because of its better tennis opportunities. It worked out, we guess.\n\nThat being said, we gotta feel for the Israelis. To let two budding tennis stars slip through their fingers... What are the odds they'll get another one?\n\nGotta check those Russian immigrant families, we guess.",
