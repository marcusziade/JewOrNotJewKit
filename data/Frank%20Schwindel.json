  "description": "Frank \"The Tank\" Schwindel is actually a very rare kind of person.\n\nYou see, Schwindel was born in Livingston, NJ. He's also a professional baseball player (he's currently with the Cubs). \n\nThe chances of a New Jersey resident making the majors is actually quite low. The baseball season in the northeast is relatively short, due to the weather. Also, the level of competition isn't up to snuff compared to other states like Florida or Arizona. (As a side note, this is why so many teams whiffed on Mike Trout.)\n\nBut it's not just the Jersey thing. Astute readers are well aware that we're shamefully familiar with this region. So we can say with (some) confidence that Livingston isn't exactly known as a baseball hotbed. We were surprised to see they even had a team, actually.\n\nSo, Frank Schwindel, professional ballplayer from Livingston, NJ = super rare. But that's not what made us plotz.\n\nThe fact that he's from Livingston and isn't Jewish? There's the real shocker.",
