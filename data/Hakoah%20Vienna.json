  "description": "If you run down the list of Austrian soccer champions, you will see the twin capital powers of Rapid and Austria Vienna (32 and 21 titles respectively) and the newly-emerging, terribly-named Red Bull Salzburg (11, including eight since 2007). Then, as you go down the list, you see: Hakoah Vienna. 1925. Champions.\n\nThat's right. Close to a century ago, the best soccer team in all of Austria was a Jewish club. This is akin to the Newark Landsmen winning the NFL title. (Is the Landsmen name too unrealistic? Not in a sport that features Redskins... But we digress.)\n\nHakoah was a truly Jewish club, featuring some of the best Jewish players of the time, from Austria, Hungary, and Romania. These included Bela Guttmann, who later had a groundbreaking coaching career, and Jozsef Eisenhoffer, who played for Hungary in the 1924 Olympics. Hakoah won their title in a dramatic fashion: goalkeeper Alexander Fabian injured his shoulder, switched to forward (substitutions were not allowed), and scored the game-winning goal.\n\nAfter the title, Hakoah toured America, and a number of players decided to stay. Most returned to Europe, but the club was never the same. The Nazis dissolved Hakoah after Anschluss (obviously, fearing Jewish sports prominence). It was reborn after the war, but as a general athletic club, without soccer.\n\nStill: Hakoah Vienna. 1925. Champions. Jews.",
