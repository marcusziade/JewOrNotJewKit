  "description": "\"My mother was born and raised on the Six Nations Indian Reservation above Lake Erie. And my father was Jewish. How's that for a combination?\" â€” Robbie Robertson\n\nA terrific combination, indeed! We can only imagine the complications arising from the clashing of two cultures. The Native American mother trying to set a Seder. The Jewish father complaining about the stringiness of buffalo meat. The wacky neighbors who don't know what to make of the couple...\n\nNow, we can't really claim that Robertson's career (he was the guitarist for one of the best-named bands of all time, The Band) was the product of such diverse upbringing, since his father passed away when Robbie was young. Nevertheless...\n\nTonight on \"That's My Folks!\", Episode 14: Father gets into hot water when he brings a bottle of Manischewitz to mother's parents. All is resolved after everyone bonds over the peace pipe...\n\nIt almost writes itself!",
