  "description": "We were in the supermarket the other day, buying our weekly load of groceries, when a song came on the loudspeaker. You know, supermarket background music: something casual to take you up and down the aisles. You're not supposed to notice it. Well, we noticed this one.\n\nNo, it wasn't from Jane's Addiction, whose frontman Perry Farrell we're profiling here, but another band from the contemporary time period. (That band had no Jews, that's why we went with Jane's and Peretz(!) Bernstein here.) The band's name and song is irrelevant. It was alt rock band and an alt rock song from 30 years ago. It was a good band! It was a good song! And it was playing as background noise in a supermarket.\n\nWhat the hell, we thought. What does this mean? When did good music become supermarket fanfare? And then we realized:\n\nIf we were in the supermarket 20 years ago and a somewhat popular song from the early 1970s came on, what would have been our reaction? (If we even noticed the song, that is...)\n\n\"Dad rock.\"\n\nWe're old.",
