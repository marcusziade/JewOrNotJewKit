  "description": "So, someone suggests we do Jewish artists. Which makes a lot of sense. Because you'd figure there ought to be a lot of them. That should keep us in new profiles for a while, right?\n\nRight?\n\nSo we did a little research and discovered a little problem. We're not going to be doing a lot of profiles on Jewish artists. For now, we're not even going to need to open up a new category.\n\nBecause, well, there aren't any.\n\nMaybe it's the artists' obsession with history's original bad boy, Jesus H. Christ. Or maybe we've always been too busy fleeing from the treif-eating, uneducated hordes to create original works of art (after all, if you don't have time to let your bread rise, you certainly aren't whipping up a quick oil painting). Whatever the reason, if famous Jewish athletes is a pamphlet, famous Jewish artists is, what, a post-it note?\n\nSo, thank G-d for Marc Chagall. Legitimately a great artist. Legitimately a Jew. We'd be the first to admit we're lucky to have him. He was even openly Jewish â€” one of his most famous works is  stained glass windows depicting Jacob's children for a temple in Jerusalem. \n\nAnd maybe there are a few other famous Jewish artists. None come to mind, but no doubt we'll find someone to profile. After all, we did Firestorm and he's not even real for crying out loud. But in the meantime we need some new Jewish artists and that right soon.\n\nSeriously, little Mordechais and Miriams, get out your easels and get to it!",
