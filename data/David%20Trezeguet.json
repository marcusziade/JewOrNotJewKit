  "description": "One of the few things we remember from social studies in high school  is the importance of primary sources. It's too bad that the Internet could care less.\n\nTake today's subject, David Trezeguet. He is a pretty good soccer player, European Champion and World Champion for France, friend of Thierry Henry. Could he be Jewish? It's not impossible, per se.\n\nYet if you go to Wikipedia, it clearly states that Trezeguet has Jewish ancestry. It's sourced and everything! Hooray?\n\nIf it was only so; you see, Wikipedia's supposed source takes you to a page that says (in Hebrew) \"even David Trezeguet has Jewish roots\". Hooray?\n\nIf it was only so; that article is not sourced at all, so the validity of that claim is iffy at best. We actually found another article, which might have been a source for this one... which does claim Trezeguet, but also makes an egregious mistake on another, clearly non-Jewish soccer player. Oh, and that article is not sourced either. G-d knows where they are getting it from.\n\nSo, if you're counting, Wikipedia is at least a tertiary source, with absolutely nothing to back up the original claim. And yet, if someone would look up Trezeguet on the Internet â€” voila, he's Jewish! But no. Maybe, possibly, but definitely? No.\n\nThe other thing we remember from social studies class? Our 9th grade history teacher wore the same dress every Monday. But that's a whole other story...",
