  "description": "Being a 19th century inventor had its benefits. For one, you had a good chance that your name would enter the dictionary.\n\nJames Watt gave us the watt. Andre-Marie Ampere begot the ampere. Joule, kelvin, ohm, coulomb, volt... There are many, many more.\n\nWe couldn't find a Jew among them. Which is strange, because Jews kinda have this science thing down. (Just look at the number of Jewish Nobel winners. Of course, that's the 20th century and beyond, not 19th. Moving on.)\n\nWell, there is one exception. Heinrich Hertz, the man behind the hertz, was definitely of Jewish heritage. His father converted and Heinrich was raised Lutheran, but the last name stayed the same. \n\nBut then, come to think of it, maybe it's good that Jewish names didn't creep into the dictionary. Hertz is fine and everything, but can you imagine buying a computer with the frequency of two gigarabinowitzes?\n\nPass.",
