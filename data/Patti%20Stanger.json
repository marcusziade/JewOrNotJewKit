  "description": "Jewish matchmaking is a tradition that goes back to the days of the patriarchs. Ever since Laban pushed his ugly daughter Leah on the unsuspecting Jacob (although we're pretty sure it wasn't Laban himself, but the unnamed Mrs. Laban who did most of the pushing), Jews have meddled in the love lives of friends and relatives.\n\nIn the days of Jewish diaspora in Eastern Europe, matchmaking was taken to new heights. Every settlement had a shadchan, who made sure that the right matches were made, and that the dowry of goats and linen was transferred properly.\n\nEven today, G-d forbid if you're Jewish, unmarried, and in your 20s (or, even worse, 30s. 40s? Oy gevalt!). You can rest assured that your mother/aunt/female-friend-who-got-married-way-too-young will do her best to set you on the right path to love, marriage, and children (lots of children, bubelah!). Not that we're talking for our own experience, of course.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Patti Stanger, Bravo's \"Millionaire Matchmaker\", is Jewish. On her show, Patti attempts to find wives for the elite of South California, but only succeeds in one thing â€” proving once again that men are only after blondes and boobs, and women are only after money.\n\nJewish matchmaking hasn't changed much at all...",
