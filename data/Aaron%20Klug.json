  "description": "We were looking at the list of Nobel laureates by country (because that's what we sometimes do in our never-ending quest for Jews), and noticed something strange: Lithuania was listed. Now, we don't want to delve into the backstory, but we happen to know something about Lithuania, and \"Nobel laureates\" doesn't exactly ring a bell. Basketball players, sure, steely-eyed blondes, sure, purse-carrying men, of course, but Nobel laureates?\n\nWell, yes, Nobel laureates. Depending on how you count, one, two, or three. This is where it gets tricky.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz was born in 1911 in what was then Russia but is now Lithuania. He won for literature. Andrew Schally was born in 1926 in what was then Poland but what is now Lithuania. He won for medicine. Aaron Klug was born in 1926 in what was then and is now Lithuania. He won for chemistry. We're mostly interested in Klug, natch, for he is Jewish. (Schally is often referred to as such, but it doesn't look to be the case.)\n\nSo why haven't we, with all our supposed Lithuanian knowledge, heard of these great men? Well, all of them emigrated from Lithuania and won the Nobel while living and working in another country. Klug, for example,  ended up in Cambridge, so Great Britain should have a bigger claim to his Nobel than Lithuania does.\n\nSo, perhaps there have been zero Lithuanian Nobel laureates. But we'll leave that discussion to LithuanianOrNotLithuanian.com...",
