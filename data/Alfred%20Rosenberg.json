  "description": "After the recent profile of Turkmen loon Saparmurat Niyazov, we got a number of inquiries about the exclusivity of our Triple Zero Club. Why is it so difficult to come up with someone for the 0/0/0 score? Couldn't we, for instance, give one to Alfred Rosenberg?\n\nFor those who don't know, Rosenberg was a sidekick of Adolf Hitler, and a big macher as far as Nazi theories are concerned (specifically the persecution of Jews). Alas, he was saddled with the name \"Alfred Rosenberg\".\n\nNo, there is nothing Jewish about that: Rosenberg's ancestry is Latvian, Estonian, German, and French, with zilch to indicate any Jewish linkage (we're pretty sure Hitler had him checked). Yet with a name like \"Alfred Rosenberg\" and the subsequent Jewish rumors that surround him, we can't help but give him a 1 for the O Score.\n\nThat being said, it's not exactly difficult to find candidates for the Triple Zero Club: David Duke. O.J. Simpson. Ted Bundy. Carrot Top. But one thing stands in their way... We just don't want to write about these psychopaths.\n\nFrankly, we didn't want to write about Alfred Rosenberg either...",
