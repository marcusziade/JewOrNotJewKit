Today, we present an excerpt from the long abandoned and unproduced original screenplay for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.\n\nWe are looking at the heavily damaged bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise. James T. Kirk stands in front of a giant view screen, projecting the image of his old nemesis, Jacob Mordechai Kahn.\n\nKirk: \"Kahn, my old enemy. You came all the way from the planet Boca Raton VI just to have your revenge on me?\"\n\nKahn: \"How dare you abandon me and my loved ones to that retirement... I mean, awful planet. What were you thinking, Captain?\"\n\nKirk: \"Actually, it's Admiral now.\"\n\nKahn: \"Oh, Mr. Fancy. Now that you're an admiral, I guess you're too important to come and visit?\"\n\nKirk: \"Kahn, please...\"\n\nKahn: \"Oh no, don't mind me, sitting around waiting for Mr. Big Shot Space Admiral to come down and visit. I'll just play Mah Jongg with the space aliens and eat soup. Well don't you worry, boytchick. Because I'll have you know that borscht is a dish best served cold. And it is very cold, in spaaaace...\" \n\nKirk: \"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaahn!\"",
