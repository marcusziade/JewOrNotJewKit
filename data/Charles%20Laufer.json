  "description": "1960s and 70s! Teens are bored! There is nothing cool in TV! Books are so lame! And mom and dad's magazines are just sooooo dull! What's a teen to do?!\n\nRead Tiger Beat, of course! Where else but in Tiger Beat can you find out about everyone from the Beach Boys to the Monkees! Ever wonder what Bobby Sherman is up to?! Well, wonder no more!\n\nPages upon pages of detailed coverage of the biggest heartthrobs! David Cassidy?! More like David Come-to-me! And the photo collages! Oh, the photo collages!\n\nAnd the exclamation points! Oh, the exclamation points! You can never have enough! How else would teens know what's exciting and what's not!\n\nAnd it didn't stop in the 60s and 70s! Michael J. Fox! Corey Feldman! New Kids on the Block! Luke Perry! Jonas Brothers! Justin Bieber! More exclamation points! And some more! And more!!!!!\n\nThank you, thank you, Charles Laufer, for creating such a groovy, edgy, amazing, totally awesome magazine!!!!!!!!!!",
