  "description": "Jewish scientists!\n\nWe're so, so dissapointed in you. Every single one of you. From the most brilliant professor to the lowliest lab assistant. All of you.\n\nYou see, Jewish scientists, every October we wait for the Nobels to come out. You always win! And not just one, it's usually a bunch! Physics, chemistry, medicine, economics... (Do we consider economics a science? Why not!) Look at the list of winners! Jews, Jews, Jews!\n\nThis year? Not so much.\n\nNorwegians, Japanese, heck, even a Romanian! Goys, goys, goys.\n\nOur only award this year? Literature, won by French Jew, Patrick Modiano. Now, we're obviously not complaining, this ends our decade-long literature drought, but...\n\nYou better get on it for next year, Jewish scientists.",
