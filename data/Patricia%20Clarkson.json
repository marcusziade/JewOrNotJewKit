  "description": "We've been watching \"Sharp Objects\" on HBO, which is pretty fantastic: good setting, good atmosphere, good mystery, good twist, good cast. Amy Adams is wonderful in it, and... just one thing:\n\nCan we stop with the dead kids already?\n\nSeriously, wherever we turn to a murder mystery, be it on TV or in a book, it seems dead kids are involved. The list is too long to go through. OK, here is one: \"Broadchurch\". Just like \"Sharp Objects\", we really enjoyed \"Broadchurch\", but why did it have to be about dead kids?\n\nOh, another thing about \"Sharp Objects\": Patricia Clarkson is so good, playing the matriarch whose role seems to define \"WASP\". Well, believe it or not, in real life she is Halachically Jewish! We have to get that in, considering this is Jew or Not Jew and all...\n\nSeriously, let's switch to a new common theme, mystery genre:\n\nDead spouses?",
