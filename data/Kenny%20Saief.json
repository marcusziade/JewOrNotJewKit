  "description": "Kenny Saief is part of a select group of soccer players. He has played internationally for two countries.\n\nFIFA, soccer's world governing body, has strict rules about switching national allegiances. It can only be done once, and it can only be done when strict requirements are met.\n\nThis brings us to Kenny Saief. In 2016, he played two games for Israel. In 2017, he decided to switch to the United States. (Probably because he thought the Americans had a chance to make the World Cup? Ahem.)\n\nHow does the Israeli-raised Saief qualify for the US? Note that we didn't say \"Israeli-born\". Saief was born in Tampa to Israeli ex-pats who then decided to return to their homeland.\n\nHold your horses, American Jewish soccer fans! Saief is not a Jew, he is a... Druze. The Druze are an ethnic and religious group with roots in the Middle East. Israel is home to some 150,000 of them.\n\nYour move, DruzeOrNotDruze.com!",
