  "description": "We were watching the famous Seinfeld episode in which Jerry's Jewish girlfriend, Rachel, sees George naked (It's shrinkage!). To pay her back, George cooks her breakfast that has lobster mixed in with scrambled eggs. The Kosher gal is horrified... never to be seen from again.\n\nWhich got us thinking, is the actress who played Rachel Jewish herself? Our guess is not; her name is Melanie Smith, and Seinfeld was the peak of her acting career. So nothing too interesting there.\n\nWhich got us thinking, are ANY of the actresses who played Jerry's girlfriends Jewish? See, this is how we spend our days. We've learned to live with it.\n\nThankfully, the Intertubes are here to help. Multiple people have compiled lists of Jerry's 57 (or so) girlfriends, some with pictures... making our job that much easier.\n\nSo, once you get past Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her iffy Jewish status, we have Amanda Peet, Debra Messing, Marlee Matlin, and (ugh) Tawny Kitaen. The one definite Jew we haven't profiled yet is Jami Gertz (Erica, Kramer's favorite phone sex operator). It looks like Jami is one of the most successful Seinfeld graduates: she had a sitcom for four years on CBS and has one currently on ABC. Who knew?\n\nNot us; apparently, we'd rather watch old Seinfeld episodes...",
