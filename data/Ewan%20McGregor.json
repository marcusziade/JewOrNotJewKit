  "description": "Once again, it's time to open our mailbox and see who our readers want us to write about! Here's a letter from Israel, asking us to profile Ewan McGregor. \"If you were girls â€” you would understand,\" the letter says.\n\nOh, but we do understand, dear reader! Ewan McGregor, talented actor, star of Trainspotting, and the only good thing about the Star Wars prequels? That's why you want us to profile him, right?\n\nSo, since we like to add to our roster of talented actors, and want to please our readers, let's give it a whirl. Perhaps Ewan has a Jewish ancestor amongst his Scottish roots? Or maybe...\n\nYes, here we go. McGregor might not be Jewish himself, but he is married to a French Jew of Greek descent, Eve Mavrakis, and they are raising their daughters Jewish.\n\nSo there you have it, dear reader. Ewan McGregor. Married to a Jew. Does that news make you happy?\n\nWhat? It doesn't? Maybe we don't understand... We're not girls, after all.",
