  "description": "We started to watch \"Succession\" on HBO, not thinking we're gonna like it too much — rich assholes being rich assholes, we've see it all before — but boy, did we end up loving it! Once you got past the slow build of the first few episodes, it turned into must-see TV as that family of rich assholes scrambled for the supposedly crumbling empire of patriarch Logan Roy (a mixture of Rupert Murdoch, King Lear, and a giant baby).\n\nJews? Not too many Jews. The family is obviously goyishe, and so are all of the primary actors. (Peter Friedman, who plays family consiglieri Frank, is a Jew, but he is a stretch for even the \"Hey, it's THAT guy!\" annals).\n\nHere is an interesting one: Logan's latest wife, the mysterious Marcia, is played by Israeli actress Hiam Abbass. (She also recently appeared as queen of the Morlocks leader of the freedom fighters in \"Blade Runner 2049\".) Note that we didn't say Jewish, as Abbas is an Arab Israeli.\n\nOf course, we wouldn't let the lack of Jews dampen our excitement about the series. Poignant, funny, dramatic, so obnoxiously ridiculous, and yet fantastic... We wouldn't have thought it when we started watching!",
