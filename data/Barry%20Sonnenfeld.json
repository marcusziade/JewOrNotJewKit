  "description": "We were watching \"Men in Black 3\" the other day, when a little spec caught our attention. It came in the scene where Tommy Lee Jones got eradicated through time travel. With him no longer existing, his apartment transformed into that of an unknowing woman's. A mezuzah appeared on the door.\n\nSo we stared at that spec of a mezuzah, and asked, why?\n\nThe unknowing woman has maybe one line of dialog. Her potential Jewishness is completely irrelevant. And who but us would even notice that little spec?\n\nSo we — what else — googled. And as it turned out, it was not just us who noticed the mezuzah. In fact, people brought it up to Barry Sonnenfeld. The Jewish director explained that it was he who put it the film. The mezuzah is there to underline the transition of the apartment from the clearly goyishe Jones to a Jewish family.\n\nSo, mystery solved. We just wish we thought of googling it sooner, and not spent the rest of the movie thinking about that darn mezuzah...",
