  "description": "Alysha Clark is one one of WNBA's best players. She is a two-time member of its all-defensive team and a two-time league champion. She's also competed internationally, playing for... Israel. And yet, Alysha is not even the best (half) Jewish player on her team!\n\nFor six years, Clark played for the Seattle Storm, sharing the court with one of the greatest women's players ever, Sue Bird, also (half) Jewish. Now, we're pretty sure these two are not swapping gefilte fish recipes (after all, Alysha was baptized as a child), and yet...\n\nThis offseason, Clark signed with the Washington Mystics, but was forced to miss the entire season due to injury. When she does return, she's guaranteed to become the best (half) Jewish player on her team!\n\nBy default, of course.",
