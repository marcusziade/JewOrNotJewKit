  "description": "One of the great stories of Olympic history is the failure of Adolf Hitler in 1936. The games were hosted in Berlin, and he planned to make them a platform to prove that Nazi supermen are everybody's superior. Jesse Owens' four gold medals put a kibosh to all that, and Hitler was rather pissed off when a black American trumped all.\n\nWell, here's hoping that Hitler caught the finals of women's fencing, because the results would have made his mustache spin.\n\nBronze went to Ellen Preis of Austria, Jew. Silver to Helene Mayer of Germany, Jew. (Yes, of Germany. She was allowed to participate as a gesture of goodwill to the Amateur Athletic Union, who were going to boycott the games if German Jews were not allowed to compete.) And gold went to Ilona Elek of Hungary, Jew. \n\nAfter winning gold in Berlin, Elek took one in London in 1948 (the two games in between were obviously canceled, thanks, Hitler), and a silver in Helsinki four years later. Add that to 19 medals (including 10 golds) at world championships spanning 22 years, and you get the most decorated female fencer of all time.\n\nSo yes, there were three Jewish women on the Olympic podium that day. Take that, Hitler.",
