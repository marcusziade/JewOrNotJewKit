  "description": "As part of JONJ's continued dedication to our long history and the Jewish community, we will occasionally republish profiles from our historical archives. Today we present this letter, written as part of the \"Jew! Or Not Jew?\" monthly newsletter, published in 1993.\n\nDear Directors Guild of America!\n\nWe have found your new mega-star. Presenting Cary Elwes!\n\nSome of you (Rob Reiner, the Zuckers, Mel Brooks) have already worked with Mr. Elwes and can attest to his excellence. Young, dashing, suave... and funny, is he ever funny! From \"The Princess Bride\" to \"Hot Shots!\" to \"Men in Tights\", Mr. Elwes brought down the house. And, unlike some other leading men, he can speak with an English accent! Not to mention that he is part Jewish!\n\nNow, you might be saying that Mr. Elwes can only do comedy. Well, we got a treat for you! You can currently see him in \"The Crush\", as the object of desire of young ingenue played by Alicia Silverstone (and we predict GREAT things for her as well!). This is precisely the dramatic role in a groundbreaking film that will push him over the top!\n\nDon't pass up this chance, directors! Doesn't Mr. Elwes deserve a chance to shine on cinema's biggest stages? Or do you want to relegate him to a future of playing psychopaths in idiotic horror films?\n\nOf course, you don't! Right?...",
