  "description": "Liechtenstein... The tiny principality sandwiched between Austria and Switzerland. Liechtenstein... The remaining echo of splintered German states. Liechtenstein... Home to 18 Jews. (Margin of error: \ufffd of a Jew). Liechtenstein... Ever so close to having a Jewish prince.\n\nLiechtenstein... How? \n\nIt all goes back to Prince Franz I, ruler of Liechtenstein from 1929 to 1938. (And yes, Liechtenstein is ruled by a prince. It's apparently not large enough to deserve a king.)\n\nSo, as noted in so many fairy tales, princes like to get married, and Franz was not immune. However, his choice for a bride wasn't exactly traditional: Elsa von Gutmann, an Austrian... Jew.\n\nOh, how the Jews of Liechtenstein must have rejoiced, as their numbers increased all the way to 19! Now, if only Elsa gave birth to a Jewish prince!\n\nAlas, Liechtenstein's Jewish royalty began and ended with Elsa. She and Franz didn't have any children. He abdicated in favor of his cousin, Franz Joseph, thwarting any chance for a royal line of Liechtensteinian (Liechtensteiny?) Jews.\n\nToo bad. So close to putting the \"stein\" in \"Liechtenstein\", weren't we?",
