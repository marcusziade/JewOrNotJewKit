  "description": "Hey, it's THAT guy!\n\nFametracker, the website that put \"Hey, it's THAT guy!\" in the Internet lexicon, has been gone for a good thirteen years, so James Wolk never had a chance to be featured on it.\n\nWe imagine his Fametracker profile delving into Wolk's stint as \"Hi, I'm Bob!\" Benson on \"Mad Men\". He followed it up with the lead role on \"Zoo\", which was supposed to elevate him from THAT guy repertoire, but didn't. His recent stint on \"Watchmen\" seemed to confirm THAT state.\n\nWhat would be Wolk's typecasting specialty? \"Pristine boy scouts with a dark secret\": that fits both \"Mad Men\" and \"Watchmen\" to a T. Perhaps even \"WASPy boy scouts\", for Wolk, who is 100% Jewish, hides it incredibly well in his roles.\n\nWell, Fametracker is long gone, so we're here to pick up the pieces. Who knows, maybe after our website departs into that server in the sky, someone might remember it as fondly as we do Fametracker...\n\nWe can only hope.",
