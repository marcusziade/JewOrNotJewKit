  "description": "In 2013, 16-year-old Arielle Gold won the world snowboarding halfpipe championship. A year later, she was all set to compete in the Sochi Olympics. Sadly, in her last practice run, she separated her shoulder and had to drop out.\n\nSo Arielle watched brother Taylor compete in the men's event (he finished out of the medals), and then spend a grueling four years just so she could finally realize her Olympian dream.\n\nWell, she made it. Of course, this is written before the Pyeongchang Olympics kick off, so here's hoping that Arielle survives the practice run this time around. And when she does, we will be rooting for her.\n\nAfter all, she has the perfect name for the Olympics.\n\n(Editor's update: She won the bronze!)",
