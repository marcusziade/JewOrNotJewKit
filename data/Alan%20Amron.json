  "description": "In the 1997 movie \"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\", Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow, starring as two airheads, well, Romy and Michele, claim to have invented Post-it notes to come off more impressive at, well, their high school reunion. (It's quite a descriptive title.) Obviously, this is not true, as Post-its were invented by the 3M corporation, specifically by Spencer Silver and Arthur Fry.\n\nWell, not exactly.\n\nIn 1998, right after the movie came out (coincidence?), 3M settled a lawsuit with Alan Amron, who claimed to have invented the Post-it. It was settled for mere $12,000, a far cry from the millions that 3M made. The corporation continues to assert that the invention is theirs; they just paid Amron to go away. Amron doesn't exactly agree.\n\nHe claims to have invented what he called Press-ons, in 1973. He made them by hand, sold a few, and went to a trade show, where he met representatives from 3M. They were interested, but explained to Amron that it was impossible to print glue in machines. In 1977, 3M started to sell \"Press 'n Peel\", which was later renamed to Post-its. In fact, a 3M employee came forward and affirmed Amron's claim. (We probably should say \"former\" employee.)\n\nAmron is quite a character; he was Muhammad Ali's manager and led a worldwide campaign to reunite the Beatles. (It didn't exactly pan out.) He also invented numerous other things, including a battery-operated water gun and spray that dissolves dog poop.\n\nWhich is the subject of the 2004 film \"Envy\", starring Ben Stiller and Jack Black. We're not sure if it spawned any dog poop-related lawsuits...",
