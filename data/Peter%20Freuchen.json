  "description": "A woman offered to bite off Peter Freuchen's toes. He declined. Instead, he chopped them off with shears and a hammer.\n\nPeter Freuchen was trapped under a blizzard. He cut out his way with a knife. The knife was made from his own feces.\n\nThese are not tall tales. These are not fake Chuck Norris facts. Peter Freuchen was not the Most Interesting Man in the World. He was a Danish Arctic explorer who had to survive glacial Greenland winters. On one occasion, he had to keep wolves away from his makeshift igloo by... singing.\n\nFreuchen did make it out (be it without a leg) and went to... Hollywood. There, a movie was made based on a book he wrote. That movie was the Oscar-winning \"Eskimo\", starring the previously-profiled Ray Mala. Oh, and Freuchen had a part as well. He played the villain.\n\nAfter that, it was back to Denmark, but World War II broke out. Freuchen hated the Nazis so much, he claimed to be Jewish whenever he encountered anitsemitism. (Alas, he wasn't, although he later married a Jewish woman.) He joined the Danish resistance, was captured by the Germans, but managed to escape to Sweden.\n\nWith the war over, Freuchen made it back to America, where... he became one of the first winners of the famed game show, \"The $64,000 Question\".\n\nDid we mention that he stood 6'7\", with a long beard and a pegleg?\n\nAlright, maybe Peter Freuchen was the real Most Interesting Man in the World.",
