  "description": "We've written about a number of Jewish athletes who made the switch to Israel to have a better chance to compete internationally. An American figure skater, an Uzbek gymnast, an Ethiopian runner... The case of Alice Schlesinger is quite the opposite: she switched FROM Israel to improve her chances.\n\nSo what is Alice's sport? Kvetching? Dreideling? Mathematics? It's judo. Israel is really, really good in judo, and Alice, who won a World Championship bronze medal back in 2009, was deemed no longer good enough to compete for her birth country.\n\nSo Alice switched to her mother's native Great Britain, and has been winning accolades for her adopted country as well. All in all, she participated in three Olympics: two for Israel and one for Britain.\n\nEven though she never tasted Olympic success, Alice has won championships outside of judo: she is a three-time world sambo champion (a martial art that was created in the Soviet Union... wait, that can't be right!?), as well is a champion in something called belt wrestling, a sport that dates back at least 4000 years.\n\nDo any countries need to import Israeli... belt wrestlers?",
