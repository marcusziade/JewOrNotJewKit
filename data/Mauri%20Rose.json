  "description": "Tuesday, June 1, 1948, Allison Transmission Plant, Indianapolis, Indiana. The exhausted Mauri Rose, transmission expert, sits down to his daily lunch next to a co-worker, Bob Thompson.\n\nBob: What you got there, Mauri?\n\nMauri: Corned beef on rye. What about you?\n\nBob: Ham and cheese on white. You want to trade?\n\nMauri: No, thank you.\n\nBob: Sure?\n\nMauri: Yes, I'm sure.\n\nBob: Suit yourself. (chewing loudly) So, did you go to the race yesterday?\n\nMauri: Yes, you can say that I did.\n\nBob: Did you see that #3 car? My, what a champion! His third time winning the Indy 500, they said! That's a record!\n\nMauri: You don't say.\n\nBob: (burping) I do say! My, I wonder how much money he's got... And how many women!\n\nMauri: (chewing)\n\nBob: Oh, to be that man! I'd never show up for work again! But what was his name... Was it Matthew? Martin? No... Marvin? Yeah, I think it was Marvin. Did you catch his name, Mauri?\n\nMauri: (getting up) Can't say that I did.\n\nBob: And you call yourself a racing fan!\n\nMauri: Have a good day, Bob.\n\nBob: (shaking head) Jews!",
