  "description": "In one were to list the greatest soccer players ever, Johan Cruyff will definitely make the top ten and likely the top five. He might even make his way into the top three.\n\nIn one were to list the greatest Jewish soccer players ever, Johan Cruyff just might appear on top of the list. If one listens to various rumors, that is.\n\nWell, those rumors turn out to be false. No, his mother is not half Jewish. No, his wife is not Jewish. Yes, he started with Ajax Amsterdam, a team sometimes nicknamed \"Jews\", but so did thousands of other players, few of them Jewish. The closest Cruyff relationship to Jews? He has two Jewish uncles by marriage, as well as a Jewish brother-in-law. Not exactly a rousing endorsement.\n\nSo no, Johan Cruyff is not a Jew. Which is unfortunate, really. For who will top that list of greatest Jewish soccer players ever?",
