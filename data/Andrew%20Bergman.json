  "description": "Who came up with \"Blazing Saddles\"? Mel Brooks, duh. Duh?\n\n\"Blazing Saddles\" was actually the brainchild of Andrew Bergman. Not only did he write the screenplay, he came up with the original concept and wanted to direct it himself. Brooks fell in love with the idea, bought the rights from Bergman, but kept him on the production. So it all worked out, even if Bergman rarely gets the credit.\n\nIn his post-Saddles life, Bergman wrote a bunch of movies, including \"Fletch\". His career in the film business pretty much stalled after he wrote and directed \"Striptease\", the ill-fated adaptation of a Carl Hiaasen novel that starred Demi Moore in a rather prominent role.\n\nBack to \"Blazing Saddles\"! Bergman's wanted to call it \"Tex X\", a take on \"Malcolm X\". But that sounded like a pornographic film, so, one morning in the shower, Brooks came up with \"Blazing Saddles\", and it stuck.\n\nSo Mel Brooks did come up with \"Blazing Saddles\". Duh?",
