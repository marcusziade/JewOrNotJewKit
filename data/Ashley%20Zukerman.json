  "description": "Have you heard? Robert Langdon is back!\n\nYou know, Robert Langdon? No? Doesn't ring a bell?\n\nLet us take you back you to the early 2000s. Oh, those were simpler times! Netflix was in the DVD delivery business. The Star Wars prequels made us all question the desirability of sand. The New England Patriots were a plucky underdog. The orange buffoon was simply a reality TV host. Facebook and Twitter didn't even exist yet. And Dan Brown ruled the roost. Dan Brown? No? Doesn't ring a bell?\n\nDan Brown, the author of \"Da Vinci's Code\", the incredibly popular, incredibly poorly-written, and yet somehow incredibly exciting novel? Robert Langdon was the main character? Tom Hanks played him in the movie? There is a prequel and a sequel? We even have a profile about it... somewhere? Oh, Aylet Zurer, whose turn in \"Angels and Demons\" did not exactly make her a household name? Why are we ending all these sentences with questions?\n\nAnyway, Robert Langdon is back. There is a new TV show, based on one of the non-filmed novels, with Langdon being played (oh, obviously not by Hanks) by someone named Ashley Zukerman (somehow, not a 90210 character, but rather an American-born Australian Jew). No, we're not watching that. Trust us, you're not watching it either.\n\nIt's not the early 2000s, after all.",
