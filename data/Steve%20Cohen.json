  "description": "If you watch \"Billions\", you know of a recurring subplot: Bobby Axelrod's \"love\" of art. We put it in quotes because his \"love\" of art mostly revolves around profiting from it.\n\nThe fictional Axelrod, as played by the man with the smallest mouth ever, Damian Lewis, is based in large part on real-life Steve Cohen. Both are billionaire hedge fund managers. Both battled the district attorney. Both were suspended from trading. Both \"love\" art. (The big difference? Axelrod is not Jewish. Cohen... do you have to ask?)\n\nCohen's real-life art collection totals a cool one billion. His biggest purchase was for $91.1 million, which was the largest ever amount spent for art at an auction: a stainless steel rabbit by Jeff Koons. We think Cohen overpaid a tad, but what do we know...\n\nIn any case, Lewis left \"Billions\", so Axelrod had to be written off. There is no telling if he would have followed Cohen in his more recent endeavor, much more foolish than spending a billion on art:\n\nBuying the New York Mets.",
