  "description": "Zach Pfeffer was one of the best young soccer players in America, signing with Major League Soccer at the age of 15. He spent five years with the usually terrible Philadelphia Union club, not playing much, but slowly coming into his own. By his fifth season, in 2015, he became a valuable contributor.\n\nThen, the Union traded him to Colorado. It could have been an opportunity for Pfeffer for a new start. Instead, he spent a year in the minors.\n\nPfeffer found another calling. Even though he signed with MLS while still in high school, he continued his education, took courses to get his diploma, and then advanced to college. Soon, soccer became secondary. In fact, Pfeffer's love of his new field entered the locker room â€” his  teammates started asking for his advice... on how to manage their money.\n\nAt the age of 21, Pfeffer retired from sport to enter the lucrative world of finance.\n\nThere is a very obvious Jewish joke in there, but we'll choose not to make it.",
