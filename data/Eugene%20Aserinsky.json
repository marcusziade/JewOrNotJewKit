  "description": "You know what is ironic? We have no idea what irony means anymore.\n\nWe suppose it's partly Alanis Morissette's fault for writing an entire song about irony that had exactly zero examples of actual ironic occurrences. But, in truth, it can't be all on Alanis. The song is really more a symptom of the overall disease.\n\nSo what is irony? Take it away, Merriam Webster! \n\n irony (noun): a situation that is strange or funny because things happen in a way that seems to be the opposite of what you expected.\n\nUmmmmm... OK? So if we walked out into the snowy, snowy winter and said, \"holy crap, it's hot out\", that would be ironic? But then, what is sarcasm? \n\nWhat if we walked out into the snowy snowy winter and got sunburn? Is that irony? And why do all of our examples involve a ton of snow?\n\nWhat about this one? Eugene Aserinsky, Russian-American Jew, discovered REM sleep when he was a grad student. He went on to spend his career studying sleep and is now considered one of the founders of modern sleep research.\n\nAserinsky died in 1998 when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car.\n\nIs that ironic? It sure sounds like irony. But then how does that square with the actual definition of irony? So... confused... \n\nAt the very least, can we all agree it's really fucking weird and move on?",
