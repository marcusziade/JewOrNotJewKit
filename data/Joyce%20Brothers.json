  "description": "At the end of \"Naked Gun\" (only one of our favorite movies of all time), Frank Drebin learns that Queen Elizabeth's potential assassin is hiding at a baseball game. Hilarity, including the most memorable national anthem EVER, ensues.\n\nPart of this hilarity is the seven-person booth that is announcing the game. It starts rather innocuously with Jim Palmer (previously profiled!) but ends with Dr. Joyce Brothers, because, you know, funny! A woman announcing a sporting event, and not just a woman, a sex therapist! (Before we forget, yes, definitely Jewish, born Joyce Bauer.)\n\nWell, Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, the joke is on us. For of all the women you could have picked to announce a sporting event, Dr. Brothers is actually a rather sensible choice. Oh, you clever Jews!\n\nAs it turns out, Dr. Brothers is a... boxing expert. In 1958, she became the first woman to serve as a color commentator for a boxing match. From that point on, however, she became a sex therapy media mogul, leaving sports in the dust. Until Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker came calling, that is.\n\nHey, look! It's Enrico Pallazzo!",
