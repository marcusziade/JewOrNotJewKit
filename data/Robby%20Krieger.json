  "description": "Attention, American parents!\n\nDid you know that your schools are subjecting your children to communist propaganda? Oh, we're not kidding!\n\nNo, despite the title of this profile, it has nothing to do with Robbie Krieger. It has everything to do with that piece of Soviet filth broadcast by every American school. We're talking about \"Peter and the Wolf\".\n\nYou know \"Peter and the Wolf\", right? If you don't, your grade-school-age kids surely do. It sure is an enchanting medley with happy animals and lovely instruments...\n\nWrong!\n\nDid you know that the titular Peter is a young communist? Did you know that the composition ends with a May Day parade? Don't believe us? Look it up!\n\nWhat does it have to do with Krieger? Well, young Robbie was so taken in by \"Peter and the Wolf\", that he decided to go into music, became one of the greatest guitarists ever as the member of The Doors, added his name to the list of superb Jewish musicians!\n\nOn second thought?\n\nMaybe \"Peter and the Wolf\" ain't so bad... At ease, American parents.",
