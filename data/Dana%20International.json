  "description": "Have you heard of Eurovision? No? Let us guess: you're American.\n\nAccross the pond, Eurovision is a pretty big deal. What is it? It's as if American Idol spanned the entire continent and inspired international arguments. It's been going on every year since 1956.\n\nEvery country that competes gets one entry, and then... people vote? We honestly have no idea how it works. In any case, a winner is crowned.\n\nMany of them get lost in obscurity, but there are a  bunch actually FAMOUS winners of Eurovision. A little band called ABBA won it for Sweden in 1974. In 1988, Celine Dion won for Switzerland. (We have no idea how she got to be Swiss, dear Canadians.) \n\nAlright, let's get to the Jews. Israel, which gets to participate even though it's not really in Europe, has actually won three times. The most famous champion is Dana International, who won in 1998. She is still one of Israel's most popular pop stars. No, that's not her real name. It's Sharon Cohen, or, if you get technical, it used to be Yaron Cohen, for Dana transitioned to female.\n\nAnd that's pretty much all we know about Eurovision. After all, we're American.",
