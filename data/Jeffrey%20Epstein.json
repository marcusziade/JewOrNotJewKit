I think he is one of yours.\n\nMoses: No, I don't think so. Definitely not.\n\nPeter: Pretty sure he is, Moishe. Don't you get all the -steins?\n\nMoses: Come on, Pete. Not all -steins are Jewish. Ever heard of David Eckstein? Baseball player.\n\nPeter: Not a fan of baseball.\n\nMoses: Well, when he gets here, don't send him to me. He is all yours.\n\nPeter: Come on, Moishe! I don't know about Eckstein, but this EPSTEIN is yours. I checked.\n\nMoses: Shit.\n\nPeter: Language, Moishe!\n\nMoses: Motherfucking shit. He IS one of us, isn't he? What the fuck are we gonna do?\n\nPeter: You're gonna have to process him?\n\nMoses: Process him? We don't process anyone, Pete. It's just an eternity of nothingness for us Jews. If you've been good: nothing. If you've been a piece of shit like this guy: nothing.\n\nPeter: That doesn't sound fair...\n\nMoses: There is no fairness in life, Peter. In death, we're all equal.\n\nPeter: Shit.\n\nMoses: Well, yeah, shit.\n\nPeter: So what are you gonna do?\n\nMoses: Maybe we can call downstairs and see if there is a loophole?\n\nPeter: Might be worth a try. Hey, anyone has Beelzebub's number?",
