  "description": "What happened to John Krasinski?\n\nIt doesn't seem so long ago that he won America's hearts on \"The Office\". Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim, the star-crossed lovers! He was destined for leading man status!\n\nAnd he did get that crack at being a leading man. There was the football movie with George Clooney, the wedding \"comedy\" with Robin Williams, and... well, more seasons as \"The Office\" descended from brilliance to irrelevancy.\n\nAnd now? If he appears in movies, it's as fourth-billed in trivial romantic comedies. On TV, he is reduced to a voice in insurance ads.\n\nPeople even stopped asking us if he is Jewish!",
