  "description": "We could talk about Bill Maher the comedian. About \"Politically Incorrect\", and \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", and the new \"Religulous\" film he has out.\n\nOr we could talk about Bill Maher the half-Jew. About how he was raised Catholic, and did not find out about his roots until he was a teenager. Perhaps this is why he didn't develop such a hatred for Judaism, compared to the one he harbors for Catholicism.\n\nInstead, we're going to talk about \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\". For those not familiar with the classic title, it stars former Playboy model and erotica actress Shannon Tweed as a feminist professor, who is led into the mysterious jungle by Maher. There, as the title suggests, they encounter cannibal women, avocados, and death.\n\nWe're not going to spoil the ending for those interested in renting the flick. It's an unforgettable hour and a half, to say the least.",
