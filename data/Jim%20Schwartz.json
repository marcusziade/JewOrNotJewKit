  "description": "Anyone who follows football even slightly knows that it has not been a good decade for the Detroit Lions. Or century. Or millennium. In fact, on the list of all time terrible teams across sports, the Lions may very well be at the top (well, them and the Clippers, honestly).\n\nBut after a long slumber of losing (again), the Lions have brought in a whole new management team (again), with the hopes of finally reviving the moribund Detroit franchise (again).\n\nAnd part of this miraculous revival is former Tennessee Titans assistant and defensive genius, head coach Jim Schwartz. Is Jim the savior the Detroit fans have prayed for? Will he bring Tennessee's toughness to the blue and silver? Can he whip rookie QB Matt Stafford into shape?\n\nAnd most importantly, is Jim Schwartz Jewish?\n\nIn short, no. (Schwartz naming his son named Christian is kind of a giveaway.) Pretty disappointing, honestly. We had high hopes for prominent success and ended up with nothing. \n\nKind of like every season for the Detroit Lions, right?",
