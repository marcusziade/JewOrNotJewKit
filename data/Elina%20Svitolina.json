  "description": "Elina Svitolina, Ukraine's best tennis player, Olympic bronze medalist, Wimbledon semifinalist, has long been rumored as Jewish. Alas, there was no proof, until a Russian-language website published the article entitled... \"Svitolina Admitted That Her Grandmother Is Jewish\".\n\nSigh.\n\nWording is important, isn't it? \"Admitted?\" As if it's some kind of a dark secret... Heck, some of us have MULTIPLE Jewish grandmothers! Oh, the shame!\n\nIn any case, the questionable language is reserved for the headline. In the body of the article, Svitolina seems to embrace her heritage. She talks about the comfort the grandmother brings to her family,  calling her the \"most Jewish of Odessa grandmothers\".\n\nHow is that for an admission?",
