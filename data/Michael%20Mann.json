  "description": "\"Heat\" was on the other night. We had to watch \"Heat\".\n\nIs it just us, or does it have the best ensemble cast of the past 20 years? Obviously, it all starts with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, still at the height of their game. (Perhaps for the final time?)\n\nOnce you get past the two leads, you have Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, the always lovely Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer's ponytail, a young Natalie Portman, Amy Brenneman (probably deserves a profile one day), Ted Levine (beginning his transition from playing psychos to playing cops), pre-rehab Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner... Even when you get to small roles, there are Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, even Jeremy Piven!\n\nThe man behind it all? Director/screenwriter/producer Michael Mann, Jew.\n\nWe'd say more, but we have to go back to watching \"Heat\"...",
