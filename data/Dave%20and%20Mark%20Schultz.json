  "description": "We finally got around to watching \"Foxcatcher\", a movie that had some Oscar buzz a decade ago before eventually fizzling out. The basic plot: A recluse heir wants to become a wrestling coach, so he enlists two Olympic champions to help him. Then he kills one of them. It's based on a true story.\n\nSteve Carell plays John du Pont, the heir to what was once the largest family fortune in America. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo play Mark and David Schultz, the brothers.\n\nMost of the movie sticks to the facts. Both Mark and Dave were gold medalists in the 1984 Olympics (in different weight classes), and both were world champions as well. (They were Jewish on their father's side, but raised Christian. That's obviously not important for the movie, but important for our website.) And in 1996, du Pont killed Dave for reasons that will forever stay unclear. He pleaded not guilty by insanity, but was convicted as \"guilty but mentally ill\". Du Pont eventually died in jail in 2010.\n\n\"Foxcatcher\" is not exactly a riveting romp by any stretch of imagination, but does contain really good performances from the three leading men. For the most part, it... fizzles out.",
