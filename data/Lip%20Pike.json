  "description": "Let's see how well our readers know our website.\n\nWhen profiling 1800s baseball great Lip Pike, will we emphasize that...\n\nHe became the first ever professional baseball player when he accepted $20 a week to play for the Philadelphia Athletics?\n\nHe once his five home runs in one game, a record sadly not counted by Major League Baseball since it came before the professional era?\n\nHe led the league in home runs four times?\n\nAt the age of 36, was playing so poorly that he got blacklisted from baseball because it was believed he was fixing games?\n\nWhile away from the game, he became a haberdasher?\n\nHe came back to play one game for the original New York Mets at the age of 42?\n\nHe raced a horse?\n\nWell, the horse, of course! For in 1873, 130 years before Fox's \"Man vs. Beast\", Pike challenged a horse to a 100-yard run, and outran the poor animal, pocketing $250, a princely sum for the time.\n\nOh, right, he was also baseball's first Jewish star. That's kinda important.",
