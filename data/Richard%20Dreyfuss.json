  "description": "The relationship between the Vatican and Israel has not always been rosy. And it's easy to understand why, with the centuries of struggles between Catholics and Jews, and all the... oh well, let's just say it. All the antisemitism.\n\nPope John Paul II did a lot to repair that relationship. His work culminated in 1993, when Vatican City finally recognized Israel as a country. Better late than never, we guess.\n\nA year later, in honor of Israel, The Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust was held. Catholic and Jewish representatives, Catholic and Jewish music, the Italian president, Rome's chief rabbi, the pope himself...\n\nAnd Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss, reciting the Kaddish. Was the pope a big fan of \"Stakeout\"?\n\nNow, we like Richard Dreyfuss. \"Jaws\" is a groundbreaking blockbuster, \"What About Bob?\" is hilariously re-watchable, and \"Stakeout\"... Well, it's much better than \"Another Stakeout\". But... as representative of the Jews? Richard Dreyfuss?\n\nMaybe we shouldn't nitpick here. It's far from being the Vatican's worst decision. For example, it took them until 1998 to apologize for the Church's silence during the Holocaust. Yeah... we really shouldn't nitpick.",
