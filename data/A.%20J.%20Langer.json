  "description": "Stop us if you heard this one: boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. She is an American actress. He is a British royal! It truly is a tale as old as time... well, at least as old as Hollywood.\n\nThis supposed fairy tale is about Allison \"AJ\" Langer, who rose to relative fame on the short-lived, well-remembered \"My So-Called Life\". She played Rayanne, Claire Danes' pill-popping BFF. Before that, AJ had a rather long child acting career. After that, well... she became a countess. Langer's husband is Lord Charles Peregrine Courtenay, 19th Earl of Devon. (Wait, a countess is a wife of a count. He is an earl. Why is she not an... earlness? Anyway...)\n\nSo now, Countess AJ lives in a castle, where she is mother to Lady Joscelyn Skye Courtenay, and Jack Haydon Langer Courtenay, Lord Courtenay. But don't you worry, AJ has not been completely corrupted by the aristocracy: she has opened the castle for theater, classic car shows, food festivals, and, of course, yoga.\n\nYou can even hold your wedding at AJ's castle.. In case you want your own slice of the supposed fairy tale?",
