  "description": "As previously discussed, there actually are some Jews playing professional football right now. Not a plethora to be sure, but plenty enough.\n\nSo where's the Jewiest team in the NFL? New York, California, Florida? Nope. Try Dallas.\n\nYes, the most Jewish team in football is in the least Jewish place on Earth (OK, we're exaggerating: It actually goes Beijing, Saudi Arabia, Dallas, then Antarctica). And how many Jews does it take to earn this esteemed title? \n\nTwo: Igor Olshansky (previously profiled when he was a member of the San Diego Chargers) and today's featured player, offensive guard Kyle Kosier. \n\nSeriously? That's bad. Nothing against Olshansky and Kosier who seem like fine fellows. And while leading the league in Jews just by suiting up two of them is embarrassing, it's not totally unexpected. But the big winner is the Dallas freakin' Cowboys? Really? That ego-maniacal, prima donna franchise with a chip on it's shoulder so big it had to build a two billion dollar stadium just to try and fill it?\n\nUgh. \n\nUsually this is the point where we call for young Jews to pick up the pigskin, but we know better than to try. Let's just hope Kosier or Olshansky get traded to a real franchise and make this whole profile obsolete.\n\nThe sooner the better.",
