  "description": "As you might know by now, we often embark on Jew-related quests for this website. Not all of these are publicized; let's just say that our quest to find a Jewish Aboriginal has hit a dead end. We're still hopeful, however.\n\nAnd we're more than hopeful in finding a Scottish Jew; more specifically, a Jew with a \"Mc\" or a \"Mac\" as the prefix in their last name. It seems unlikely, but with interfaith marriages, conversions, and the scary similarities between haggis and kishkes, does not seem impossible.\n\nSo we started our search with the actress Frances McDormand, who is married to director Joel Coen of the Coen Brothers. It seems rather plausible that, after being embraced by such a Jewish clan, she might have shed her goyishe ways and swapped bannock and cranachan for matzah and kugel. \n\nBut no. Frances did not convert. She still belongs to a religion called \"Disciples of Christ\". Don't ask us what that is, we have no idea either.\n\nSo we struck out with McDormand. Just as well; how much fun would it be if our quest ended in the first place we looked?",
