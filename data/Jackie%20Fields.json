  "description": "We have not crowned the greatest Jewish boxer ever? We, the website that always gives such definitive answers to similar questions? So, let's discuss...\n\nThe top contenders are Max Baer, Barney Ross, and Benny Leonard, all previously profiled. Baer: world heavyweight champion, record of 81 wins, 13 losses. Ross: champion in three weight classes, 74-4. Leonard: world lightweight champion, 185(!)-22. But what about Jackie Fields?\n\nFields (real name: Finkelstein!) was also a world champion, who held the welterweight crown twice. His all-time record stood at 72-9. But he has one advantage on the other contenders: that is only his professional total. Fields is part of a rare group: a professional world champion and an Olympic gold medalist!\n\nFields won the gold in Paris in 1924, beating fellow American Joseph Salas for the title. He turned professional soon after, to great acclaim, as explained above.\n\nSo, greatest Jewish boxer ever? Well, it's very hard to compare between all these records and weight classes. Inconclusive?\n\nSorry for those expecting definitive answers...",
