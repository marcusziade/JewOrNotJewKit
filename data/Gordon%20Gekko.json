  "description": "\"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.\" â€” Gordon Gekko\n\nAh, Gordon Gekko. The personification of the me-first 80s. The slick suit. The giant cell phone. The suspenders. The greed. Oh, the greed.\n\nAnd... could he be? For we really hate the \"Jews are greedy\" stereotype. And Gekko (that can't be a real last name! Gekowitz? Gekstein?), although not exhibiting any obvious ethnic or religious traits (other than worshiping the almighty dollar), is based on the following three people:\n\nIvan Boesky, inside trader, Jew\nCarl Icahn, corporate raider, Jew\nMichael Milken, junk bond king, Jew\n\nAnd, of course, played by:\n\nMichael Douglas, Jew\n\nAnd then there is that quote... \"That's the one thing you have to remember about WASPs: they love animals and hate people.\"\n\nSo... ummm... Isn't Gordon Gekko awesome? Showing that Jews can rise to power, can own it all!\n\nGreed, after all, is good?",
