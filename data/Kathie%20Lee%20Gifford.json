  "description": "We've never liked Kathie Lee Gifford. Did we have a good reason? Not really. She was annoying on TV, but it's not like we ever watched her show.\n\nIt's just that... she had that WASPy perkiness that we found incredibly irksome. Something just didn't feel right in our Jewish hearts.\n\nAnd were we ever right. You see, that WASPy perkiness is a front. Kathie Lee, born Kathryn Epstein, with a Jewish father, raised, as she says herself, \"with many Jewish traditions\"... Until she saw a Christian video and decided to dive into Christianity head first.\n\nUgh.\n\nReally? A Christian video? Dear faithful reader, we don't know how much you value your beliefs, but we hope it takes more than a video to drastically alter them.\n\nDid we say that we didn't have a good reason to dislike Kathie Lee?\n\nNot anymore.",
