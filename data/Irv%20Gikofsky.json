  "description": "Some of us went to college in upstate New York, meaning we spent four years in the wilderness. It was New York and yet it wasn't; even the TV channels were from Buffalo or Syracuse.

She didn't stay there for the full hour, wandering around the studio, changing locations with every segment, like a forever lost soul. There were slideshows. There were pointlessly acute angles. There was a guy screaming at the camera. There were loud noises. There was Twitter, Twitter, TWITTER! There was Mr. G.\n\nYes, poor Mr. G, somehow keeping his dignity in the middle of this huge, ludicrous mess. Still giving us the weather after all these years. Still putting on a smile, trying to rise above what's surrounding him.\n\nAnd then he departed and the hostess read a tweet from \"ShowMyDong\". We wish we were kidding.\n\nWe're better off in the wilderness...",
