  "description": "Here we go, yet another old-timey boxer profile on JONJ... Who is it this time, a very obscure Jewish world champion, someone with a terrible nickname, or both?\n\nHow about none of the above?\n\nJoe Choynski never got to be world champion, even though he was damn good. Among his many conquests was the famed Jack Johnson, who later became Heavyweight World Champion... something Choynski never got a chance to be.\n\nFor whatever reason, title holders at the time didn't want to give \"Chrysanthemum Joe\" a chance. It might have something to do with being one of the hardest punches on the circuit... despite \"The California Terror\" often giving 50 pounds away to his opponent.\n\nYes, he was called \"Chrysanthemum Joe\" and \"The California Terror\".\n\nTalk about FANTASTIC nicknames!",
