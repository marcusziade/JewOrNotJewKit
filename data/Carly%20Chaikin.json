  "description": "This is nominally a profile of Carly Chaikin (She plays Darlene on \"Mr. Robot\". She is Jewish.), but it's being written to serve a purpose.\n\nWe've spoken before about our inability to quit TV shows. We feel the need to stick it out even when the show drops in quality. Well, with \"Mr. Robot\", this is happening.\n\nA year ago, we were engrossed. We couldn't wait for a new episode. The trials of Elliot, hacking away, trapped by his mind and the outside world... it was great.\n\nThe key word is \"was\". Season 2 has been... absolutely awful. Meandering storylines, uninteresting characters, pointless subplots, scenes that drag with no end. It's all style, no substance... except the style is passe. Most importantly, it just bores us to death. Is there a payoff? Perhaps, but we're not sticking around for it.\n\nSo here we are, proclaiming that we will never watch \"Mr. Robot\" again. Hopefully, by putting it down in writing, it will make it easier to follow through...",
