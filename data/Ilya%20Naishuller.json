  "description": "There are a few problems with how Russians are portrayed in Hollywood. The days of steel-faced generals might be gone, so now all we get is snarling mobsters. With terrible, terrible accents.\n\nWhich, you know, is fine. (Well, maybe not the accent part. But then, the majority could care less if some Serb or Slovak mangles Russian curses... or if poor Scarlett Johansson tongue-twists her way through simple sentences. So, whatever.)\n\nBut every once in a while, a Russian director get a chance to make inroads in Hollywood and change the stereotype. Timur Bekmambetov got a few cracks. Now it's Ilya Naishuller, who helmed the first-person \"Hardcore Henry\" and now \"Nobody\", starring Bob Odenkirk and even old Doc Brown, Christopher Lloyd.\n\nSo what happens in \"Nobody\"? Odenkirk single-handedly takes on a horde of... snarling Russian mobsters.\n\nWell, at least Naishuller got the accents right.\n\n(Editor's update: This was written before Russia's attack on Ukraine, but it kept getting bumped in our schedule. Today, how Russians are presented in Hollywood should be the least of anyone's worries...)",
