  "description": "This website is sometimes a window into our lives the last 11 (G-d damn it! 11!) years. More specifically, it's a window to the movies and TV shows we've watched.\n\nScroll down through the various profiles and you can see what we've been up to. Oh, sure, we are all over the map, but there are some specific cases where what we write is directly influenced by what we watch. For example, back in 2013, we profiled Ted Levine by talking about \"The Bridge\", a show whose relevance was debatable even back then. There are countless other examples.\n\nWhich brings us to: today, May 2018, when we're catching up on two things: \"House of Cards\" and Marvel movies. (Some of us FINALLY succumbed to the temptation and finally got Netflix; watching \"Infinity War\" made us want to revisit what we've missed.) This leads to a profile of Corey Stoll, who is Jewish, and played the rather goyishe Peter Russo on \"Cards\" and was the evil (and also goyishe) Yellowjacket in \"Ant-Man\"!\n\nSo, another one for the annals. Who knows, maybe one day we'll read all the profiles chronologically and relive our lives...\n\nProbably not.",
