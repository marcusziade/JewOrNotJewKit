  "description": "So, Jew or Not Jew, didn't you say that finding a wide receiver for your all-time All-Jewish NFL team will not be difficult?\n\nWell, yes, we did, in the Marshall Goldberg profile. Thank you for paying attention!\n\nSo who is he?\n\nShouldn't it be obvious? It's his profile, after all!\n\nSam McCullum? He doesn't... look Jewish?\n\nHaven't you learned anything from our first 1500 profiles?\n\nNo, I've only started reading your website recently.\n\nOh.\n\nSo, who is Sam McCullum?\n\nWide receiver for the Vikings and Seahawks in the 70s and 80s. Put up pretty good career numbers. Was blacklisted during the 1982 NFL player strike.\n\nAnd how is he Jewish?\n\nHe converted upon marriage.\n\nOh.\n\nOh indeed.",
