  "description": "Each year, the Oscars ceremony includes the death montage: a sequence of clips honoring those in the movie industry that passed away during the previous year. It is one of the most popular features of the entire evening, and also one of the most controversial. \n\nWho should have been included? Who shouldn't have? Who should be the anchor?\n\nYes, the anchor: the last person shown in the montage. The spot is usually reserved for the biggest and most beloved of stars, and that person's picture is usually given a long, heartfelt ovation. Recent anchors include Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, and Billy Wilder.\n\nIn any case, this past Oscar season, our bet (and yes, some actually wager on this!) would have been on Tony Curtis. The multi-talented actor starred in over 100 films, including the all-time classic \"Some Like It Hot\". And yes, he was Jewish, born Bernard Herschel Schwartz in the Bronx to Hungarian immigrants.\n\nBut no, this year the Academy anchored the montage with... Lena Horne.\n\nWhat the hell? In what world should Lena Horne be honored more than Tony Curtis? What an absurd decision!\n\nBut not as absurd as arguing about the death montage anchor in the first place.",
