  "description": "When Rabbi Fred Neulander was put on trial for the murder of his wife in 1994, quite a bit of evidence was paraded before the New Jersey jury.\n\nThe rabbi was having an affair with a woman he met at a funeral (her husband's funeral at which he presided. Oy).\n\nThe Talmudist Neulander had also befriended a member of his own congregation and used that influence to convince the poor shmendrick (Oy. Oy vey!) to murder the good rabbi's wife (Oy! Oy! Oy!). \n\nAnd further, as proof of Rabbi Neulander's lack of faith and thus his ability to commit this unholiest of unholies, he had served shrimp at his 1965 wedding to the woman whose corpse now lay before him.\n\nWait, what? \n\nYes yes yes, the laws of kashrut strictly forbid the eating of the animal that which feedeth on the bottomed sea, but come on! For one thing he was a Reform rabbi for whom, frankly, we're not sure even murder is strictly forbidden (frowned upon, maybe). \n\nAnd even if he was the most orthodox of the orthodox it's a g-ddammed shrimp for Hashem's sake! People aren't driven to murder because they ate a shrimp! \n\nThough on the other hand, we certainly understand killing because you couldn't eat one...",
