  "description": "When the world's first ever 24-hour sports radio network was in its early stages, they considered naming it WMAN. It's a good thing they changed that \"M\" to an \"F\" then, since the first voice ever heard on the network was that of Suzyn Waldman. You know, a woman.\n\n24-hour sports radio is commonplace now (too commonplace, honestly), but at the time that FAN launched it was actually quite radical. So it makes sense that Waldman was involved, then, since groundbreaking is something she's done her whole career.\n\nBeyond being the first voice of sports radio (and also the last to not be shouting incoherently), Suzyn Waldman was also the second woman to ever call play-by-play for a major league team and is currently the third woman ever to do color commentary for one. In fact, right now, she's the only day-to-day female broadcaster in professional baseball.\n\nSo her voice has a tendency to make cats turn upside-down and try to rub their own ears off on the carpet. So she's a little too buddy-buddy with the players, managers, owners, umpires, maintenance staff, hot dog vendors, local garbage men, etc. So she'll probably be remembered forever for having an orgasm on air when Roger Clemens announced he was coming out of retirement.\n\nSo what?\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that any woman working in sports today is almost literally standing on Waldman's back. Or that she's notably absent from the booth every Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur.\n\nAnd she's still not even 1/4 as annoying as her play-by-play partner and professional blowhard, John Sterling.",
