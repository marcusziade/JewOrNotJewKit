  "description": "Often, when we find out someone assumed Jewish is not, we are disappointed. This time, we are doing cartwheels.\n\nDavid Berkowitz. Son of Sam. Notorious serial killer. That last name sure sounds Jewish, doesn't it?\n\nWell, he was adopted by Jews. His birth parents were Betty and Anthony Falco... So can we breathe easily?\n\nNot so fast. It turns out his real father was actually Joseph Kleinman, a Jew, and Betty Falco's maiden name was Broder... a Jew as well.\n\nOh no, no, no, no, no...\n\nOr... yes! Berkowicz became a born-again Christian, denouncing Judaism. Ensue the cartwheels.\n\nBesides, real Jews don't take orders from talking dogs.",
