  "description": "Could it be? Did we really find someone who will top (well, bottom) the lowest ever score of 3 that corresponds to a \"Sadly, a Jew\" verdict?\n\nLooks like current record holder Ike Turner has some competition. The contender? Former warlord and deposed Liberian president, Charles Taylor.\n\nChuck's resume is beyond evil. Staging civil wars. Conscription of children. Terrorism. Murder, violence, rape. Sexual slavery. And regular slavery to boot. \n\nSo clearly, a low score is in the cards. But why would he get a \"Sadly, a Jew\"?\n\nTurns out Taylor converted to Judaism in captivity. Shrug.\n\nNot to worry, landsmen! Looks like his conversion was not exactly clear-cut. According to his wife, Taylor \"still believes in Christ and hoped to embrace both religions simultaneously\".\n\nSo, Chuck gets the lowest ever score for a \"Barely a Jew\" verdict. You're safe for now, Ike Turner.",
