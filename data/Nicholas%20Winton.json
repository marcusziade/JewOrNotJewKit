  "description": "Righteous Among the Nations. Israel's way to honor the goyim who helped save Jews during World War II. Oskar Schindler. Raoul Wallenberg. Irena Sendler. But somehow, NOT Nicholas Winton.\n\nThe omission is rather strange, because Winton saved hundreds of Jewish children from Czechoslovakia in 1939. He set up trains that carried them from Nazi-occupied Prague to Britain. A total of 669 children were rescued by Winton.\n\nSo why hasn't Israel honored him? Is it because Winton kept his good deed a secret until the 1980s? No. It's because Winton, although a Christian, was born Jewish. That automatically disqualified him from Israel's Righteous list.\n\nSupposedly, Winton doesn't mind the omission. He doesn't see anything he did as extraordinary.\n\nWell, we do. And someone like Winton should never go forgotten.\n\nShame on you, Israel.",
