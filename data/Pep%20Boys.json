  "description": "The Pep Boys: Moe, Manny, and Jack. Three giant heads scaring children from miles away. Three giant... Jewish heads?\n\nAs the story goes, in 1921, four friends (wait a minute, four?), Maurice \"Moe\" Strauss (aha), Emanuel \"Manny\" Rosenfeld (aha), Graham \"Jack\" Jackson (???), and Moe Radavitz (another Moe?) decided to start an auto supply company. As a logo, they chose themselves, with three stylized heads: Moe, Manny, and Jack (we guess two Moes was one too many).\n\nSoon, Jack left the company, so his face was replaced. No, not by the second Moe (poor second Moe), but by the first Moe's brother, Isidore \"Izzy\" Strauss. We guess \"Moe, Manny, and Izzy\" was a tad too Jewy, so they stuck with the original names.\n\nSo, there you have it. Three giant, Jewish heads. Which leaves us with one question...\n\nWhat the heck are Jews doing fixing cars?",
