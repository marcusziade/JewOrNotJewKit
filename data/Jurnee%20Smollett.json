  "description": "Perhaps we shouldn't have stopped short in the just-published Zach Gilford profile that discussed the future of various \"teen\" actors from \"Friday Night Lights\". We missed one rather successful alum who joined the show in season 4... and one Jew.\n\nThe successful alum is Michael B. Jordan, who came on FNL after a stint on \"The Wire\" and rose to major fame (\"Black Panther\" and \"Creed\"). He is probably the most successful graduate of the show, edging out Jesse Plemons.\n\nThe Jew is Jurnee Smollett, profiled here. Her father is Jewish and her mother is goyishe Black; her brother Jussie is also an actor, but is now better-known for faking a hate crime assault. Jurnee has been in a bunch of stuff since FNL ended, including \"True Blood\", a starring role in \"Lovecraft Country\", and as the Black Canary in \"Birds of Prey\".\n\nSo is this it for our infatuation with FNL? Probably. Unless we discover some more Jews in season 5...",
