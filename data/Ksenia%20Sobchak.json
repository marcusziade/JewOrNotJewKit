  "description": "The Russian elections are back in 2018. Oh, goody! We wonder who will win!\n\nA new candidate has been making the rounds. Her name is Ksenia Sobchak, and her background is not exactly traditional. Well, other than the fact that her father was the mayor of Saint Petersburg and a mentor of Vladimir Putin. There's that.\n\nBut Ksenia is, well, a woman, and, well, quite young, and, well, even part Jewish, and, well, quite well known in Russia... as its \"Paris Hilton\". Ksenia dismisses that comparison (anyone with half a brain does not want to be compared to Paris Hilton), but it does make sense on the surface: until recently, she was best known as a socialite and television personality. She even wrote a book, \"How to Marry a Millionaire\", and hosted a bunch of reality shows. (No country is stupid enough to elect a reality show host to be its president, right?)\n\nKsenia is also quite outspoken, which is rather rare in Russia for obvious reasons. She is even against the annexation of Crimea! Talk about nerve...\n\nGood luck, Ksenia, because you're gonna need it! And watch your back, please. Russian opposition is not exactly known to end well...",
