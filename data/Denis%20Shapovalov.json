  "description": "The tennis world has a brand new star! His name is Denis Shapovalov, he is only 18 years old, but he already won the junior Wimbledon and has beaten Rafael Nadal! With a name like that, he must be Russian...\n\nCorrect, but: Denis' parents are Russian. He was born in Israel, so he must be Israeli...\n\nCorrect, but: Denis' family moved to Canada before he was one year old, and he represents Canada intentionally, so he must be Canadian...\n\nCorrect, but: Denis currently lives in the Bahamas, so he must be Bahamian...\n\nCorrect, but: Wait, didn't we say he was born in Israel? He must be Jewish...\n\nCorrect, but: Even though Denis is Halachically Jewish, he wears a cross.\n\nUnfortunately, that's correct.",
