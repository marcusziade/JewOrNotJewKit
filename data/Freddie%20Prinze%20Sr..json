  "description": "Today, Freddie Prinze Senior is best known for fathering Freddie Prinze Junior, but in his day he was a well-known actor and comedian.\n\nA comedian who told everyone that he was \"Hungarican\", son of a Hungarian Jewish father and a Puerto Rican Catholic mother.\n\nOne little problem. The mother part was all true. The father? Not exactly. He was actually German, with absolutely no evidence of Jewishness.\n\nSo why the lie? Prinze thought that being Jewish would give him an advantage in the industry. That's right. In the world of entertainment where pretty much everyone tries to hide their Jewishness, Prinze thought it would give him a leg up.\n\nAll fine and good. How we can fault anyone for wanting to be Jewish?\n\nIt's wanting to be Hungarian that we can't understand.",
