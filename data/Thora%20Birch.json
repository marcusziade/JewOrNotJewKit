One was an established child star. She played Harrison Ford's daughter in two Jack Ryan films, and had just came off an acclaimed, star-turning performance in Oscar-winning \"American Beauty\". The other had a role in \"Home Alone 3\".\n\nThe former got all the acclaim for \"Ghost World\", with numerous award nominations and wins. The latter was somewhat praised.\n\nSo who were the two girls? The first was Thora Birch (because we just had to fit this in, her parents were porn actors who met on the set of \"Deep Throat\"). The second, much lesser acclaimed one, was Scarlett Johansson.\n\nTen years later: Johansson is a bonafide star, major award winner, arguably the most sought-after actress in Hollywood, not to mention the feature performer in an uncounted number of male fantasies. Birch? Not so much. Her recent attempt at a grown-up film career was in a movie named \"Winter of Frozen Dreams\". It only made news because her (former?) porn actor father asked to be present during Thora's sex scenes.\n\nSadly, struggling to find one's place in the world is not exclusive to fictional high school graduates...",
