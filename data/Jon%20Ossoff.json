  "description": "Hey, Internet! Yes, you, series of tubes! Do your research! Don't forget Dick!\n\nHere's what you're saying upon Jon Ossoff's historic, government-altering election to the Senate from Georgia:\n\nOssoff will be the first Jewish senator elected from a southern state since the 1880s.\n\nA version of this has appeared in numerous publications. It's simply not correct: they are forgetting Dick.\n\nWith his election, he became the first Jewish person sent to the Senate from the South since the 1880s.\n\nThe above quote, which is is eerily similar, is not about Ossoff at all. It from the obit of Dick Stone, who was Florida's senator from 1975 to 1980. So, while Ossoff's Jewishness is surely a rare occurrence, he is not alone in the past 140(!) years.\n\nOf course, we've profiled many Jewish US senators, and we never got to Stone...\n\nWe guess Dick is just that forgettable.",
