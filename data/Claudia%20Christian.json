  "description": "We get a lot of requests to profile actors and characters from shows we just don't watch. NCIS, for instance. In fact, we don't know anyone who watches NCIS. Yet the requests keep coming in. Is that show still on? We don't have the slightest idea.\n\nNow, in case of Babylon 5, we know that hasn't been on for over a decade. Yet the show still has feverish fans who keep bugging us to profile Commander Susan Ivanova, who is apparently some Russian Jewish space captain. All fine and good. But can we really profile the character without watching the show? And we really have no desire to watch the show. (We're trying very very hard not to call it a Star Trek ripoff. Oops, there we go.)\n\nWe'd much rather profile the actress who plays Susan, Claudia Christian, who says she has a Jewish father. So does that mean there are Jewish Christians out there?\n\nWell, further digging uncovered that Claudia was born with the last name of Coghlan, which is not as goyishe as Christian (nothing is), but is up there. But her birth father was not Jewish at all; the one she is talking about is likely her stepfather.\n\nSo, no Jewish Christians. That would have been too weird.\n\nBut not as weird as people who keep asking us to profile someone from Mr. Belvedere.",
