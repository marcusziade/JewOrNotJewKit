  "description": "Saints come in many forms. There are your traditional saints, your Saint Peters and Saint Pauls.\n\nThen there are some modern saints, like Mother Teresa.\n\nAnd then there saints of a different kind altogether, like hockey player Martin St. Louis, the New Orleans Saints of the NFL, and St. Bernards, the wonderful rescue dogs of the Swiss Alps.\n\nNone of those saints are Jewish.\n\nBut actress Jill St. John, one-time Batman villainess, Bond Girl (Tiffany Case in \"Diamonds are Forever\") and girlfriend of Frank Sinatra, Sean Connery, and Henry Kissinger, is. She was born Jill Oppenheim, but changed her name to something distinctly less Jewish. Well, at least she didn't go with Jill St. Christian or Jill St. Cross.\n\nSaint Nicholas, AKA Santa Claus? Don't get us started.",
