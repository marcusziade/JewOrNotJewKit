  "description": "If you were a New York sports fan in the 1940s... or 50s... or 60s... or 70s... or 80s... you must have heard the voice of Marty Glickman. At one time or another, Glickman provided commentary to pretty much every New York team.\n\nAnd no, Glickman wasn't just another nerdy Jew who spent his youth dreaming of sports glory that was never to come. He was a star in football and track. In fact, Glickman came oh so close to tasting that glory when he was named to the Olympic 4x100 relay team.\n\nUnfortunately for Glickman, those Olympics fell in 1936 and the not-so-friendly confines of Nazi Germany. So the US Olympic committee, led by an openly antisemitic president, took it away from Glickman. He and another Jew, Sam Stoller, were dropped from the team.\n\nOn that team was Jesse Owens, who ardently argued against Glickman's removal. Alas, his requests were not met. The Americans did end up with the gold, but Glickman was resigned to ending his athletic career.\n\nOn the track, at least. He did become the voice of New York sports for a good half century.\n\nNo antisemitism could take away that.",
