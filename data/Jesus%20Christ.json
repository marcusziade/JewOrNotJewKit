We'll let you know when it's safe to return.\n\nAre they all gone? Good. So what can be said about Jesus Christ that hasn't been said before? And how can we say it without offending a large portion of the population? (For we're sure, even though we asked them to step away, a small percentage of our small percentage of non-Jewish readers is not listening to our pleas and is still reading this profile.)\n\nLet's see. Jesus Christ. The Original Goy. Hmmmm.\n\nIt's pretty difficult. Maybe we should just write this profile straightforwardly, and do an analysis of Jesus' Jewish and non-Jewish aspects, his life and his death (Nothing after that death. Just checking if you're reading, goyim.), and the consequences of his existence on the Jewish people (not good, to say the least). Y'know, if he even existed in the first place. (Seriously, goyim. Why are you reading this?)\n\nBut that's been done before. By smarter men than us. Time and time again. So what are we to do?\n\nJesus Christ. The Original Goy. Seriously, what more needs to be said?\n\nIt's safe to come back to your computer now. That ham sandwich is getting stale.\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"profileImage\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() { setImage('buddy_christ'); }, false);",
