  "description": "We're obviously not ones to read the romance rumor section, but apparently Aaron Sorkin and Courtney Love are now a couple. \n\nYes, Aaron Sorkin, the man who wrote \"A Few Good Men\", \"The West Wing\", \"The Social Network\", and \"The Newsroom\", and Courtney Love, a noted crackhead. Romance is strange and mysterious like that. Courtney even likens the couple to Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe!\n\nAnd... we can see that. Like Miller, Sorkin is a Jewish playwright held in high esteem. And like Monroe, Love is... promiscuous? Has a drug problem? The similarities are through the roof!\n\nSo let's embrace America's newest sweethearts! Or, you know, not.\n\nYou can do better, Aaron.",
