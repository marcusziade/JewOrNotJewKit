  "description": "In 1841, Juan Nepomuceno Fernandez Lindo y Zelaya (Juan Lindo for short) became the first ever Jewish head of state when he became the President of newly independent El Salvador.\n\nA few caveats here: 1) Clearly, there were Jewish heads of state in the ancient world (your Judeas, etc). 2) Only Lindo's father was Jewish; he himself was apparently Catholic... It is what it is. We didn't really expect to find a full-blown Jew in charge of a country named \"El Salvador\".\n\nIt only took six years to get the second Jewish head of state. It happened in neighboring Honduras, who elected... Juan Lindo!\n\nThat's right, Juan Nepomuceno Fernandez Lindo y Zelaya (Juan Lindo for short) was first the President of El Salvador, and then the President of Honduras!\n\nHow on earth did he pull that off?",
