  "description": "\"I'll take Memorable Jewish Characters in Literature for 200, Alex.\"\n\nThis miser beats orphans in Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\".\n\n\"Who is Fagin?\"\n\nCorrect. It's still your board.\n\n\"I'll take Memorable Jewish Characters in Literature... wait a minute!\"\n\nThat's right, let's wait a minute. Are there any memorable — genuinely memorable, Jewish — definitely, without any questions, Jewish, characters in literature? There's Fagin. There's Shakespeare's Shylock. There's Hemingway's friend in \"The Sun Also Rises\" — so memorable that we can't even remember his name.\n\nUgh. We'll just have to change the category. Is \"Memorable Jewish Comedians\" available?",
