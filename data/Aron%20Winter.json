  "description": "Surinamese-born Aron Winter was a classy soccer player for Amsterdam's famed Ajax club. He won numerous domestic and international honors and was regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world. So it was no surprise when Italian club Lazio forked out a hefty sum to sign the Dutch international in 1992. What was surprising is what followed. At least for Winter, it was.\n\nHe was welcomed with the chants of \"n****r Jew\". By Lazio's own fans.\n\nWinter should have known better. Lazio, once Mussolini's favorite team, has been tied to Italian fascist for decades. Many of its fans are, well, incredibly racist, even against their own players. But for that \"Jew\" part...\n\nWinter isn't Jewish. His first name is rather Jewy, sure, and Ajax, his original club, does have Jewish associations, but that's as far as that goes. Perhaps if they found out Winter's middle name... Oy.\n\nMohamed. Yeah, that wouldn't have been better.",
