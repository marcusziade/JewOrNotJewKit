  "description": "Who created \"Watchmen\"?\n\nFor those who read the original seminal series from the 1980s, the answer is simple: Alan Moore. The Welsh auteur's opus turned the comic book genre on its head.\n\nBut what if one is not familiar with the original, and was only introduced to \"Watchmen\" from the recent HBO series? The one that Moore publicly disowned even before it was made?\n\nThe show's creator Damon Lindelof, whose previous TV ventures included \"Lost\" and \"Leftovers\", took Moore's base and expanded it. The series took place 30 years after the comic's end. New characters were introduced; old ones remained, but, in some cases, evolved to something Moore would probably not have foresaw. The results were fantastic, at least for those of us not reared on the original.\n\nSo, the answer to the opening question is... Alan Moore AND Damon Lindelof?\n\nThe \"Watchmen\" movie from 2009? You know, let's not bring that up.",
