  "description": "Our readers constantly send in requests for new members of the Triple Zero Club. One recent suggestion was Benito Mussolini.\n\nOn the surface, Il Duce seems like a perfect addition to the terrible zeros. Yet there is one association that will likely prevent him from joining the club.\n\nWhen we determine the Jew Score, we always add an I point for goyim that are married to Jews. The thought is, if you're married to a Jew, some Jewyness is bound to rub off. Now, Mussolini wasn't married to a Jew, but he did have a Jewish mistress: Margherita Sarfatti.\n\nSarfatti was more than Mussolini's mistress (she was also his biographer!). An art critic and journalist, she wrote Il Duce's speeches. Some have called her \"the Jewish mother of Italian fascism\" (not exactly a common combination). In the 1930s, when antisemitism rose in Italy, Sarfatti got out, obviously leaving her now-former lover behind.\n\nSo would a Jewish mistress give Mussolini that solitary I point? It's tough to say... so, as you see, we've profiled Sarfatti instead!",
