  "description": "Dear Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert,\n\nYou didn't have to do that.\n\nThe fans already turned against LeBron James. Your former player proved to be a self-absorbed, self-promoting, coattail-riding traitor. You should have taken the high road. You should have not written that letter.\n\nYou came off angry, bitter, and whiny. Your overuse of CAPITALIZATION and the Comic Sans font made you look amateurish. LeBron was already a bad guy; there was no need to pile it on. You sounded like a baby whose favorite toy was taken away.\n\nAnd you know what's the worst thing to come out of it?\n\nPeople now want to find out if that angry, bitter, whiny Dan Gilbert could possibly be Jewish.",
