  "description": "This year's NHL Draft is sure to be full of intrigue. There are not one, but two supposedly exceptional talents entering the league: Finnish winger Kaapa Kakko and American center Jack Hughes.\n\nIt's even more intriguing for us: our favorite team, the New Jersey Devils, owns the top pick. The second belongs to their archrivals, the New York Rangers.\n\nIt doesn't end there: while Kakko is as goyishe as they come, Hughes is rather surprisingly Jewish. His mother, Ellen Weinberg-Hughes, played hockey herself, even winning a silver medal with the USA at the World Championship.\n\nSo will the Devils draft Hughes, and will he tear up the league, giving us unending reasons to kvell? Or how will we feel if Kakko is the one who turns out to be a worldbeater while Hughes wallows in mediocrity? Or, what if — G-d forbid — Devils draft Kakko, he ends up not living up to expectations, and Hughes killing it up for the hated Rangers?\n\nYour K Score is bound to fluctuate, Jack.\n\n(Editor's update, June 21, 2019: He's a Devil!)\n\n(Editor's update, 2023: And he's a superstar!)",
