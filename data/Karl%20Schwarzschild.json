  "description": "Let's say you are falling into a black hole. It could happen!\n\nSo you're falling, and falling, and falling, and then... you're fucked.\n\nThat point comes when you pass the hole's Schwarzschild radius. That number is named for the fantastically mustached Karl Schwarzschild, Jew, and easily determined if you know the mass of the black hole. (Other objects have a Schwarzschild radius as well; be they the Sun, the Earth, or the really heavy guy sitting next to you on an airplane.)\n\nSo once you get past that radius, there is no way back. (As an aside, that was determined by David Finkelstein, Jew.) You're stuck in the black hole. You won't be able to escape it. You're fucked.\n\nDon't fall into a black hole!",
