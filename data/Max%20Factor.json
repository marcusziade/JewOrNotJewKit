  "description": "\"Max Factor\" sure sounds like a cool brand name. Max Factor! It's edgy! It's hip! And it's perfect for the world of cosmetics; one wonders how many hours in front of focus groups were spent to come up with a name that fits so well.\n\nOne small problem. Max Factor is not a name made up by focus groups. It's a person, as in Max Factor. Well, Max Faktorowicz. A Polish Jewish cosmetologist who was lured by the bright lights of Hollywood a century ago. And did Hollywood ever need cosmetics! It was a perfect match.\n\nSo perfect that after Max passed away, his son, Frank, renamed himself as Max Factor, Jr. If only all Jewish names were as edgy and hip...\n\nPaging Moishe Maybelline?",
