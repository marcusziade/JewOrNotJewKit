  "description": "\"I hate myself and I want to die\"\n\nIf Kurt Cobain was the voice of the early 90s, then Elizabeth Wurtzel was the words. Her debut novel, \"Prozac Nation\", came out in 1994. In it, Wurtzel documented her struggles with depression, drugs, family, and relationships. \"I hate myself and I want to die\"? Those are literally the first words of her memoir. It's as if someone took the youthful misanthropy that defined the early 90s and put it writing.\n\nCobain died, of course. Wurtzel didn't; she wrote more books, attended law school, recovered from her pit of despair... or so it seemed. In 2013, Wurtzel wrote an article for New York Magazine detailing her continuous struggles with... depression, drugs, family, and relationships. Two decades passed, and, apparently, not much has changed.\n\nWurtzel passed away from cancer in early 2020 at the age of 52.\n\nDepressing.",
