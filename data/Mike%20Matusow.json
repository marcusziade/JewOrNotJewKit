  "description": "Poker's big on TV right now. There must be some Jewish professional poker players out there.\n\nLet's see... Johnny Chan, Scotty Nguyen, obviously not.\n\nLove to have Dan Harrington... nope.\n\nPhil Ivey? Joseph Hachem, Greg Raymer, Chris Moneymaker? No, no, no, no.\n\nHey what about Daniel Negreanu? He could be Jewish. Yeah, Kid Poker! Plays like he can read minds. A true poker superstar... not Jewish. Darn.\n\nPhil Hellmuth. Oh, please no... \n\nPhew.\n\nOh wait. Mike \"The Mouth\" Matusow? Jewish? Oh no....\n\nY'know, maybe in this case we're better off not knowing. Let's forget we ever brought it up.",
