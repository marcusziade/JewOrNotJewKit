  "description": "Watching \"Family Guy\" leads to all kinds of questions:\n\nCan everyone understand what Stewie is saying? \n\nWhy does Peter keep fighting a giant, yellow chicken?\n\nIs Brian a man who looks like a dog? Or a dog that just talks? And if he is, why does he date human women?\n\nWhy are they showing Conway Twitty singing for 10 minutes?\n\nDidn't we already see this on \"The Simpsons\"?\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nOne thing we didn't ask about? The recent episode where it was revealed that Lois Griffin is Jewish (through her maternal grandmother Hebrewberg, though it hasn't changed her dedication to Jesus).\n\nBut seriously, a red haired, large nosed, nagging, well-heeled daddy's girl? The only question we have here is how we ever thought she wasn't a member of the tribe.",
