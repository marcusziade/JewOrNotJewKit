  "description": "All goyim have Christmas Eve traditions. Be it caroling (barf), drinking egg nog (double barf), or making fun of Jews (Probably? We don't really know), one is constant year after year. Every Christmas Eve, goyim sit around the television set and watch \"It's a Wonderful Life\". (BARF!)\n\nOh, if there was a bigger piece of Christmas-themed schlock! (Maybe \"A Christmas Carol\"? It's a close call.) Oh, dear me, what a terrible world it would be if what's-his-face (errr... Jimmy Stewart's character... George Bailey â€” we had to look it up) didn't exist! Oh, what horrors!\n\nWell, you know something, goyim? Just like Jews wrote all your Christmas songs (see the Mel Torme profile) and created many of your beloved Christmas characters (Rudolph, etc), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was made up by a Jew as well! No, not the movie, that was written by a goyishe husband-and-wife pair and directed by the goyishe Frank Capra. But it's based on \"The Greatest Gift\", a short story written by Philip Van Doren Stern, Jew! (Wait? Are we sure? That sounds pretty darn goyishe!... Yep, Jew. On his father's side.)\n\nPretty sad, goyim, relying on Jews to make up your precious holiday iconography.\n\nCome to think of it, Jews made up the original Christmas story as well...",
