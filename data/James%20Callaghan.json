  "description": "James Callaghan's reign as UK Prime Minister is primarily remembered for two things: his struggle against unions (AKA the \"Winter of Discontent\") and... his ouster.\n\nIt was during that coldest winter in years that Callaghan's reign began to crumble. The fight against unions led to widespread strikes. The nation was not happy. The House of Commons decided to hold a No Confidence vote.\n\n(You see that, America? The legislative branch has an option to oust the head of state if they are not confident in the way the country is going. Just saying...)\n\nCallaghan was ousted, 311 votes to 310. That's right, the difference was one vote. Margaret Thatcher took over, swiftly ruled over the unions with an iron fist, and the rest is history.\n\nShould we be happy that Callaghan is not remembered for being part Jewish?\n\nThat's probably alright...",
