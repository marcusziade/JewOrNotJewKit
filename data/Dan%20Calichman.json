  "description": "2020 was supposed to be the celebration of Major League Soccer's 25th season. All the way back in 1996, the plucky upstart league rose from the ashes of the 1994 World Cup and somehow managed to survive for a quarter century.\n\nDespite the league's early struggles, it did one thing correctly out of the gate: give American players a chance. Instead of relying on foreign mercenaries, MLS built itself on the back of those who have been overlooked for decades.\n\nTake Dan Calichman. After playing at little Williams College, he had to go to Japan to become a professional. When MLS started, Calichman came back home and spent six years patrolling the backline of three different teams. For his stellar performance, he was called up to the US national team.\n\nEarly MLS was built on the backs of players like that. As years passed, the foundation became firmer, new teams were added, and millions of dollars started flowing. The league continued to evolve, and one day is destined to become one of the best in the world.\n\nAll of this was supposed to be celebrated in 2020.\n\nWe miss sports.",
