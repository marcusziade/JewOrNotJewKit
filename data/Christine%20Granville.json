  "description": "On June 15, 1952, a sealiner stewardess named Christine Granville was found stabbed to death in a hotel room.\n\nChristine was not just a simple stewardess; in fact, she wasn't really \"Christine Granville\". Born in Poland as Krystyna Skarbek, to a goyishe count and a Jewish mother, she spent World War II as a British intelligence officer.\n\nThis truly is stuff out of a novel: a gorgeous beauty who jumped from lover to lover (one agent said that her \"attractiveness appeared to be causing some difficulty\")... but was also a top-notch spy.\n\nCaptured by the Nazis in 1941, she bit through her tongue, feigning tuberculosis. She was let go, and joined England's Special Operations Executive under the name \"Christine Granville\". With the SOE, she worked behind enemy lines, helped smuggle people between borders, aided resistance fighters, and saved numerous lives. She was even called Winston Churchill's favorite spy... and Churchill liked his spies.\n\nSo what happened on that fateful June night? The war was long over, but was Christine still an operative? Was the stewardess a cover for secret spy activity? Was her killer an agent for another side?\n\nNo. He was just a spurned lover.\n\nAttractiveness causing some difficulty indeed...",
