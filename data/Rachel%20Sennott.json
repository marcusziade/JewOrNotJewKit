  "description": "Today, we open our mailbox and find a letter from a Brazilian reader titled \"We need to talk about Rachel\". Sure, who doesn't love Rachel! We've profiled so many Rachels!\n\nThere is Rachel McAdams and Rachel Bloom, Rachel Weisz and Rachel Brosnahan, Rachel Bilson and Rachel Dratch â€” and that's just the actresses! Rachel Maddow, Rachel Zoe, Rachel from the Bible, and of course, who could forget Rachel Green from Friends, all profiled by JONJ! So which Rachel do you want to talk about, Brazilian correspondent?\n\nOh. It's Rachel Sennott. Well... she is not Jewish (of course, neither are McAdams or Brosnahan). So why Sennott?\n\nOh. Apparently, she starred in \"Shiva Baby\". Yeah, we remember that (obviously) very, very Jewy movie. But no, not Jewish; she's Irish/Italian Catholic. Strangely, Dianna Agron, who plays a very WASPy goy in that film, is a Jew in real life. (We already profiled Dianna, natch.) So is there another reason the reader wants us to profile Sennott?\n\nOh. Because of a \"massive crush on her\".\n\nCan't argue with that...",
