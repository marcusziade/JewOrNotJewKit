  "description": "Bonjour, Mlle Arnezeder,\n\nApologies! That's as much French as we know. We're writing to you from America, the land of opportunity.\n\nScratch that, Mlle Arnezeder. America might be the land of opportunity for some, but we advise you to stay away. Sure, you got a TV series for CBS already in the can, but don't take it further. No good will come out of it.\n\nWe, Americans, Mlle Arnezeder, just don't appreciate the French. We ridicule you behind your back. We see you as cheese-eating surrender monkeys. It's sad, but true.\n\nThat TV series might feel like a breakthrough, but, trust us, Mlle Arnezeder, it will not last. You will soon become an afterthought. Go back to France, Mlle Arnezeder, where you are considered one of the best up-and-coming actresses! Where you can be a major star!\n\nWhy we do we care so much? Well, Mlle Arnezeder, we try to watch out for all young Jewish actresses, regardless of nationality. Yes, even the French!\n\nAu revoir,\n\nJuif ou Pas Juif",
