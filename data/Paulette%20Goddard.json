  "description": "They say that human cells replace themselves every seven years, making you into a completely new person.\n\nThe change seems to be even more drastic with websites. After seven years, your average site goes through multiple regenerations. If it survives that span, that is.\n\nAnd yet, on this, the seventh anniversary of our website, we're not much different from the day we started. Oh, sure, we added a few wrinkles (did you know that the originally there were no verdicts?), and the number of profiles have risen to a then-unfathomable 1,665, and yet...\n\nThe one major difference seems to be the type of people we profile. If you take a look at the first 100 profiles, most of them are household names. The farther you go in our website's lifespan, the more obscure some of these names become.\n\nSo we started with profiling Charlie Chaplin. Today, seven years later, we profile Charlie Chaplin's wife. His third wife, to be exact: Paulette Goddard, born Levy. Half Jewish. No, not exactly obscure; during her time, she was quite a star. (Her marriages after Chaplin were rather noteworthy as well: Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque.)\n\nSo where will our website be seven years from now?\n\nProfiling Charlie Chaplin's half-brother?",
