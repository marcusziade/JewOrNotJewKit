  "description": "Aaron Swartz helped make the Internet what it is today. He contributed to the creation of RSS, Creative Commons, and Reddit. He was a proponent of an open, free, unregulated Internet.\n\nRegulation of the Internet killed Aaron Swartz.\n\nSwartz was downloading academic journals at MIT. Apparently, that was a big no-no, even though he was a fellow at Harvard, which provided access to MIT's repository. In any case, Swartz was arrested, indicted, and prosecuted.\n\nAnd Swartz couldn't take it. Faced with a brutal legal battle and potential 50 years in jail, he took his own life.\n\nWas it worth it, Internet regulators?",
