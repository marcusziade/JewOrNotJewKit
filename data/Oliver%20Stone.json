  "description": "Oliver Stone's father was Jewish, but he was in rebellion against his Judaism.\n\nOliver Stone's mother was Catholic, but she was in rebellion against her Catholicism.\n\nSo the two compromised. They raised their son Protestant.\n\nNow, how is that a compromise? Judaism is not even represented. No wonder someone pulled in all these directions started to see conspiracies everywhere.\n\nWell, be it Jewish or Catholic roots or a Protestant upbringing, Stone has shed it all for Buddhism.\n\nLet that be a lesson for all parents from interfaith families: if you try some flimsy compromise, your child might go in an entirely different direction altogether.\n\nOf course, if you're rebelling against your own religion, you might not mind that at all.",
