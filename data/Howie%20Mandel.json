  "description": "Originally, we were going to embrace Howie's Jewishness with a parody of \"Deal or No Deal\". We went to the official website and downloaded pictures of all the models. We even read up on some bios. Did you know that Lisa (briefcase #3) was a fan of \"The Smurfs\"? We sure didn't...\n\nAnd then, to brush up on the show, we decided to watch an episode of \"Deal\", to get the parody right.\n\nSo we watched. We sat through an entire episode. An entire hour-long episode. We will never get that hour of our life back. Ever.\n\n\"DEAL OR NO DEAL\" IS THE STUPIDEST SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. Yes, we've heard of \"My Mother The Car\" and \"Homeboys in Outer Space\". We stand by the original statement.\n\nSo sorry, JONJ readers. No models holding suitcases. No exciting game where you can win (fictional) money. Just a picture of the idiotic host and the sad, sad, sad verdict.",
