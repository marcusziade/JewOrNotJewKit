  "description": "If you've seen the sport pages recently, you've probably read that 50-year-old Nancy Lieberman signed a one-week contract to play in the WNBA. Now, we don't pretend to be experts on women's basketball, far from it, but we think many have heard of Lieberman, though they may remember her by her previous name, Nancy Lieberman-Cline.\n\nAnd with good reason. She's a pioneer. One of the greatest female basketball players ever. Member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nBut there's another Hall of Fame that Nancy was inducted into: the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. So Lieberman is a great basketball player and a Jew. Profile over! Hooray!\n\nNot so fast. \n\nBecause Nancy, while technically part of the IJSHoF's class of 2007, will never actually be a member. Why not? Although she considers herself Jewish, Nancy is now a born-again Christian.\n\nDisgusting. And here we thought we might actually watch a WNBA game. \n\nCongrats Nancy, you avoided the Jewish Hall of Fame. But the Jew or Not Jew Hall of Shame? Consider yourself a lifetime member.",
