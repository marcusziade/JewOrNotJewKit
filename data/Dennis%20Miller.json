  "description": "Now, we don't want to get off on a rant here, but what happened to Dennis Miller? The erudite wordsmith that fired off verbose remarks, first behind the Weekend Update desk on \"Saturday Night Live\" and then on his own show on HBO? The sarcastic malcontent with a mischievous glimmer in his eye? The uncombed jester who took every opportunity to point out fallacies in our deficient system? The Francois Rabelais of the television set? The modern Sisyphus rolling his eternal rock up the mountain of obtuse ignorance? Yeah, that Dennis Miller! Whatever happened to him? First, it was an awful attempt at acting in that 90s harbinger, \"The Net\", and the bizarre \"Bordello of Blood\". That was followed by an ill-advised stint on \"Monday Night Football\", where his highbrow word choice purposely flew over the head of the boorish audience. Then, it was a slow but steady descent into conservative hysteria that peaked with a recurring segment with that boorish blowhard, Bill O'Reilly. Now, it's a plunge into obscure oblivion, when only rare memories to remind us of the jocular jester that once was. And, babe, it's not just the conservative politics, it's that, quite simply, Miller stopped being funny. Of course, that's just our opinion. We could be wrong.",
