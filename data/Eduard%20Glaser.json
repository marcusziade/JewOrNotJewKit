  "description": "Today, our world tour takes us to... where? Yemen? We're not going to freakin' Yemen! Not just because of the Civil War that has raged there for the past decade. They are not exactly welcoming to Jews, and that's putting it mildly.\n\nThere used to be quite a lot of Jews in Yemen, of course, but most of them got out years ago. (Apparently, there is... one left. The Yemenis put him in jail.) Today, there is about half of million of Yemeni Jews spread through the world, with the vast majority in Israel.\n\nOne of the most important Jews in the history of Yemen was the man who... well, pretty much wrote the history of Yemen. Bohemian-born fantastically-mustached explorer Eduard Glaser traveled to the Middle East in the late 19th century and is considered one of the greatest scholars in Yemeni history. He documented much of its history and cultural traditions, researched geology and geography.\n\nAlas, your regular non-Jewish Yemenis had no idea who Glaser was. They knew him as Faqih Hussein bin Abdallah el Biraki Essajah... he had to disguise himself as a Muslim.\n\nNo, Jews just don't venture to Yemen, be it now or 150 years ago...",
