  "description": "Can Martin Short break the all-time JONJ record for a goyishe Jew Score? It has stood at 10 since the original goy profile, Charlie Chaplin.\n\nLike Chaplin, Short is not Jewish. Like Chaplin, many many people assume that he is. Like Chaplin, Short is pretty much beloved by everyone. Like Chaplin, he is pretty funny (although that has no real effect on his Jew Score). Like Chaplin, Short is actually Irish mixed with English (predominantly former in his case, latter in Chaplin's).\n\nSo all of that gives Short a rather high O Score, a rather high K Score (we'd love to have you, Marty! Alas...), but there is just no way to get a positive I Score. (We thought that he might have a chance by earning a bonus point from a Jewish spouse, but Marty's wife Nancy Dolman was also goyishe.)\n\nSo, a very high goyishe Jew Score, but no record...\n\nWhat's this? According to Short, he is \"10 percent Jewish on my agent's side!\"\n\nThat's surely worth an I point!\n\nfunction addPoint() {\nsetRatings(1, 4, 5);\n}",
