  "description": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shrek is Jewish? Let us stop you right here. He's so obviously Scottish!\n\nOr is he?\n\nWhat's so Scottish about Shrek? Well, the accent, obviously. But remove the twang: you are left with a big-nosed misanthrope who is forced to live outside the Pale of Settlement, is not welcome by the royals, and is subject to countless fiery pogroms.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa! Here you go again, shoehorning a Jew where there is none in the first place!\n\nOr is there?\n\nShrek was originally created by cartoonist William Steig, Jew. Not only that, his name comes from the Yiddish shrek: fear, terror (shreklekh: awful, horrible; shrekn: to frighten, to scare).\n\nFine, fine, fine. So we give you that. Maybe Shrek is somewhat Jewish. But what about the accent?\n\nWell... maybe he is a Jewish ogre to just happened to live in Scotland long enough to acquire a brogue?\n\nWhoa.",
