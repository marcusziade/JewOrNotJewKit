  "description": "The Ringer — maybe not the best source for sports wisdom, but certainly A source — recently named Houston Astros starting third baseman Alex Bregman as a rising star.\n\nThat's great! That's excellent! Alex Bregman is 24, he hits a ton, and is definitely Jewish. He attended temple (in Albuquerque?!) and everything. But The Ringer didn't praise Bregman's hitting or fielding or even his Jewriffic bonafides. Instead they wrote a paean to Bregman's bad-ass-itude. Which would be cool if he, y'know, was actually badass.\n\nWhat did Bregman do to earn this praise? He stared at a camera for a bit too long after hitting a home run. He responded to a snarky tweet by being snarky. That's it.\n\nSeriously? Is that really all it takes to be a villain in baseball these days? Look what's going on in the world right now. How football and basketball players are taking self expression to the next level to enact real social change. But Alex Bregman, he stares at cameras, watch out for him! Oooooooo.\n\nSeriously, baseball? Get a life.",
