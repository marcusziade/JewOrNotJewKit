Fill up your diaphragms, clear your vocal chords and lift your voices as one as we all... sing along with JONJ!\n\nI had to be a Jew, I had to be a Jew \nI wandered around, and finally found \nThe religion to\nWhich I could be true\nThough I'm not through and through\nIt might make you glad\nOr maybe just sad \nTo know I'm a Jew \nSome albums I've made\n'Bout Christmas, you say \nMy Dad loved the cross\nBut he's not the boss \nAnd Mom was a Jew \nShe gave me the blood that no album could kill \nWith all of it's faults I am a Jew still \nI had to be a Jew \nI had to be a Jew \nI had to be a Jew",
