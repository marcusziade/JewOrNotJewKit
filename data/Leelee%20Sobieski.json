  "description": "We love our readers, we really do (without them, this website would have stopped existing a long time ago), but some of them are a tad... zealous. There is a small subsection of readers who keep flooding our mailbox with the same suggestion over and over and over again.\n\nDear zealous readers, we beg you: stop! There is no difference between sending something one, ten, or a hundred times. Every suggestion is recorded in our files, and one day might be addressed... or not.\n\nTake a look at Leelee Sobieski. Her name first arrived in our mailbox in 2011, nine years ago! She was an up-and-coming actress in the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, and was considered a potential star after her turn as Joan of Arc. (A Jewish Joan of Arc? Not the strangest casting choice ever, but...) So why didn't we profile Leelee back then? Who knows. Perhaps we were waiting for her to break through? (She didn't, and quit acting in 2012.)\n\nYet today, in 2020, Leelee is finally getting her profile! We'll even specify her Jewish heritage, which comes in at 3/8 (even though she is known to wear a cross). We hope that suggester from back in 2011 is satisfied...\n\nGood things come to those who wait, zealous readers.",
