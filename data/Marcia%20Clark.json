  "description": "We often try to be topical here on JONJ. When Eliot Spitzer gets caught\nwith his pants down, here we are, telling the world that yes, he is\nsadly, a Jew. When Madonna divorces Guy Ritchie, we immediately\nstart questioning the latter's devotion to Kabbalah. And there are\nnumerous other examples.\n\nSo why does this profile seems a decade too late? What's that, it's\nbeen not ten, but thirteen years? Why does the Trial of the Century\nseem so... last century?\n\nDoes anyone still care that O.J. prosecutor Marcia Clark is not only\nJewish, but was raised Orthodox? Thirteen years ago, her new hairdo\nsent shockwaves through the nation. Now, does anyone even remember who she is?\n\nOh well. We don't always have to be topical. After all, we did profile\nCorey Feldman.",
