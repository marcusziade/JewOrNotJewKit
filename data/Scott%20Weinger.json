  "description": "\"Aladdin\" might be one of the best Disney animated movies ever, and it also signaled a major revolution at the studio. Sure, one can say that it started with \"The Little Mermaid\" three years prior and continued with \"Beauty and the Beast\", but let us ask you: can you name ONE voice actor from those two (also wonderful) films?\n\nOkay, Angela Lansbury as that teapot, fine. Not exactly the main draw. But who voiced Belle and the Beast, Ariel and Eric? You don't know. (Unless you are a giant Disney nerd, which some of us are. But not the ones writing this profile, and we don't know!)\n\nNow, who played the Genie in Aladdin? Robin Williams, duh! It was the first example of Disney using star power in its animated movies. Robin was terrific, of course, so the stars kept on coming. Matthew Broderick and James Earl Jones in \"The Lion King\", Mel Gibson (it was a different time) in \"Pocahontas\", Demi Moore and Kevin Kline in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", Danny DeVito and James Woods in \"Hercules\"...\n\nSo who is this Scott Weinger and what is he doing in this profile? Well, while Williams was the only true star power in \"Aladdin\" (We're NOT forgetting Gilbert Gottfried!), Weigner was actually Aladdin! It was his second movie role after playing \"Shark Attack Kid\" in \"Police Academy 5\". (We are not making this up!) Weigner's other big claim to fame is DJ's boyfriend on \"Full House\"... Yeah, not exactly Matthew Broderick here.\n\nSo Disney's Aladdin is Jewish in real life... Can we call that revolutionary?",
