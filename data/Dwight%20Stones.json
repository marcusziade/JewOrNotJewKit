  "description": "From a decade starting in 1953, the world record in the high jump was constantly improving. But then progress stopped. The last mark, 2.28 meters, set by Soviet jumper Valeri Brumel (Not a Jew), stayed frozen.\n\nSo jumpers started to look for ways to change their style, and thus the Fosbury Flop was born. Developed by Dick Fosbury (Not a Jew), it took the world by storm in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. While previous record-holders used the straddle technique, jumping over the bar face down, Fosbury twisted his back over the obstacle, wowing the audience and taking the gold medal in the process.\n\nBut he didn't set the world record.\n\nIn 1971, Pat Matzdorf (Not a Jew) did push the mark once centimeter with the straddle, but a year later when Dwight Stones (Jew!) took over. The Californian set the record three times, last pushing it to 2.32 meters in 1976. He also picked up two Olympic bronzes, in Munich in 1972 and in Montreal four years later.\n\nBut now the record is stagnant again. Since 1993, no one has been able to touch 2.45 meters as set by Javier Sotomayor (Not a Jew). Maybe there's someone out there working hard on perfecting a new technique? But even so, how likely is that person to be Jewish...",
