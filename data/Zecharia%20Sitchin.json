  "description": "Have you ever looked out there and wondered, how did it all come about? Oh, sure G-d, Adam, Eve, snakes, apples, and whatever, but really?\n\nWell, the answer is simple.\n\nAncient alien astronauts.\n\nThat's right, ancient alien astronauts. It's so obvious, isn't it?\n\nOh, don't shake your head, dismissing it all as hogwash! There are actual theories out there, such as the one proposed by Zecharia Sitchin. The Soviet-born, Israeli-raised, American author wrote numerous volumes on the subject, claiming evidence of alien presence in civilizations ranging from the Sumerians to the Olmecs. Plus, it's right there in Genesis: the Nephilim, Biblical offspring of \"sons of G-d\", were really aliens! See, you just weren't looking hard enough!\n\nAnd Sitchin is not alone. There are others out there, writing, theorizing, and those who are reading, believing...\n\nAnd you know what? Fine. It's all hogwash. But it still makes more sense than creationism.",
