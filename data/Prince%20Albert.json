  "description": "Grave robbers of Great Britain! Amateur and professional! We're looking for YOU!\n\nThe location: Frogmore Gardens, Berkshire. The building: Royal Mausoleum. The target: the tomb of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort. The goal: figuring out if Albert was Jewish.\n\nHere's the backstory: Albert, known for his liberal reforms, the husband of Victoria, the father of Edward VII, the great-great-grandfather of the current queen, Elizabeth II, was the son of Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. At least, that's the official line. The rumor says that his real father was Jewish chamberlain Baron von Mayern. Louise was even expelled from court for the affair. There is some secondary evidence, such as Ernest's hereditary syphilis (ewww! We HAD to go there!) that was not passed down to Albert.\n\nBut these are just rumors. In fact, Louise got around â€” there is at least one other documented affair on record. So we're gonna need some proof. (For those who say we could just test the DNA of Albert's living descendants, 1) for all we know, with all these royals, there has been another affair or two down the line, and 2) you try to get close to get a sample from a royal family member. Grave robbing just seems simpler.)\n\nUntil then the verdict stays \"Not a Jew\". But we're waiting, Great Britain's grave robbers.",
