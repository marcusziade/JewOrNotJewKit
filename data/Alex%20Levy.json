  "description": "Why does Apple TV+ exist? No, not Apple TV the media player, but Apple TV+, the streaming service. Not the best choice of names, if you ask us.\n\nIt's got something like ten shows and a couple of movies, and then absolutely nothing in its library to rival its competitors. Why would anyone pay for this?\n\nWe don't think it's to watch \"The Morning Show\", ATV+'s flagship offering. Jennifer Aniston! Reece Witherspoon! Steve Carrell! Millions were spent on big names, and to what end? It's a middling, average show.\n\nAnd yet, we had to watch it when we found out that Aniston's character was named Alex Levy. Levy! That can't be random, right?\n\nMaybe it is. We sludged through what amounted to ten hours, hoping for a Jewy hint. Nothing. Alex Levy will have to join Rachel Green on the list of Aniston's ambiguously Jewish characters. And we'll never get these ten hours back.\n\nNow \"Ted Lasso\"... Ted Lasso is great. But that alone can't salvage Apple TV+!\n\n(Editor's update: It took a while, but Apple is chock full of quality shows. Too bad \"The Morning Show\" is not one of them!)",
