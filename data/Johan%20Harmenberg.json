  "description": "Today, we have a bone to pick with the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nWait a darn minute here! Shouldn't we applaud any organization that celebrates Jewish achievement? Doesn't this very website often plow through the list of the Hall's honorees to write some obscure profile? Like this one, of Swedish fencer Johan Harmenberg!?\n\nAs much as we appreciate what the Hall does, we just wish it was... a little more accurate. Take Harmenberg, who won a gold for Sweden in the 1980 Olympics. He was inducted to the Hall back in 1997. And yet, he is no longer listed. Why?\n\nWell, look at him! If that man is Jewish, we quit. No, seriously, this is the last profile ever. So long. Nice to know you. We've had a good run, no?\n\nDid the Hall bite on the -berg ending? Or was it Harmenberg's career outside of sport, which included MIT and distinguished work in immunology? It's hard to say. Whatever the case was, they have corrected the error and quietly removed the Swede.\n\nNo, this website has never made a similar mistake. Don't be ridiculous!",
