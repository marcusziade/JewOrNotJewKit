  "description": "Actress Frances Bay passed away last year, but you're not likely to see her name in the Oscar Death Montage. The odds are somewhat higher for the Emmy Death Montage, but we're not holding our breath. Which is a shame.\n\nFor Frances Bay, nee Goffman, for the past 30 years, played every grandmother EVER.\n\nShe was the Fonz's grandmother in Happy Days and Happy Gilmore's grandmother in, well, Happy Gilmore. But it doesn't stop there. Countless roles as \"Grandma Johnson\", \"Grandma Julia\", \"Grandma George\", or just plain old \"Grandma\" and \"Granny\". (There are some aunts thrown in there, just for good measure. Also \"Wise Old Woman\". And \"Evil Old Lady\". Oh, the range!)\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the iconic turn on Seinfeld as the old woman that Jerry steals the marble rye from.\n\nIf we had a Jew or Not Jew Death Montage for 2011, there is no way Frances Bay would be forgotten.",
