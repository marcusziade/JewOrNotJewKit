  "description": "When Laraine Newman appeared on the SNL 40th Reunion, she received little recognition. Which got us thinking, who had the best post-SNL career of the original Not Ready For Primetime Players?\n\nDan Aykroyd is clearly tops. He hasn't made a good movie in over a decade, but after you come up with Ghostbusters, all is forgiven.\n\nChevy Chase did give us Fletch, but once you get past that, he is a miserable misanthrope with awful career missteps.\n\nGilda Radner and John Belushi are forever beloved, but, sadly, their early deaths remove them from consideration.\n\nGarrett Morris was never beloved, but he suffered a premature demise as well... What? He is still alive? You don't say!\n\nSo does this make Newman, who spent the last 30 years in minor roles and voice acting, the second most successful original SNL alum?\n\nOh, right, Jane Curtin won a couple of Emmys in the 80s, and then was on Third Rock from the Sun. So, third place for Newman. Who would have guessed?",
