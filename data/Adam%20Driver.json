No, not that a Star Wars movie can be great again. That was accomplished. It asks us to believe that the gangling, gigantic Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) could be the son of Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford.\n\nSee, we can buy a world where Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen can give birth to Fisher and Mark Hamill. Christensen provides enough blonde goy genes to go around. But could two Jews like Fisher and Ford produce such gangling, ginormous, goyishe Driver?\n\nNow, to be fair, both Fisher and Ford and only half Jewish in real life, but did you see how they look in \"The Force Awakens\"? Fisher resembles a textbook Jewish grandmother! When Leia hugs Han, it seems she wants to invite him in for gefilte fish (apologies to Admiral Ackbar) and latkes!\n\nNo, we don't see it. So let us guess the big reveal of Episode VIII:\n\nKylo Ren is adopted.\n\n\nWell, since you don't want to see spoilers, we can't really talk about \"Star Wars\"...\n\n\"Girls\"? You want us to talk about \"Girls\", the HBO show Adam Driver is on? Go read the Lena Dunham profile then, it talks all about \"Girls\"... Now select YES above and let us talk about \"Star Wars\"!\n\n\n\nfor (i=0;i\u003c2;i++) {\ndocument.ff.r1[i].checked = false;\n}\nfunction doSelect(x) {\ndv1 = d1; dv2 = d2;\nif (x == 1) {dv1 = d2; dv2 = d1;}\ndv2.style.display='none';\ndv1.style.display='inline';\n}",
