  "description": "Did you know that Wilt Chamberlain had a Jewish mother and father?\n\nReally!\n\nAlright, not really.\n\nAs the story goes, in the 1950s, Wilt worked as a bellhop at Kutsher's Hotel in the Catskills. He was quite possibly the best bellhop ever: he could carry multiple suitcases in one arm and was able to reach the second floor through the outside window. Oh, and Wilt played some basketball. Imagine: hundreds of New York Jews in their best resort wear, watching a towering seven-footer shoot hoops... as an opening act for a Borscht Belt comedian. It was a different time.\n\nIn any case, the owners of Kutsher's, Milton and Helen, took a liking to Wilt, and the feeling was mutual. Even as his career turned to NBA stardom, even as he scored 100 points in one game, even as he shtupped the supposed 20,000 women, he would return year after year. The bond between the Kutshers and Wilt was so strong that he called them, \"my second mom and dad\".\n\nYes, really.",
