  "description": "Fred Flintstone. Prehistoric man. American icon. Voiced by a Jew, Alan Reed, who actually based the character's voice and mannerisms on his own grandfather.\n\nFred Flintstone. Husband. Father. Friend. Owner of a pet dinosaur.\n\nOh, to hark back to prehistoric times, when giant beasts were roaming the world! When dinosaur and man lived in peace! When...\n\nOh. Right. That...\n\nWell, believe it or not, this is what creationists believe. You see, they can't really deny the existence of dinosaurs, since there are fossils and bones and stuff. So they try to shoehorn them into the Biblical narrative, and it's pretty hard to do, since G-d created animals on the sixth day... Right before he decided to dabble in man. So, there is only one logical conclusion: dinosaur and man lived side by side. Yes, just like on the Flintstones. There are people who believe that. Yes, really. Really!\n\nHere's a quote from a prominent creationist website: \"The Bible makes it plain that dinosaurs and people must have lived together.\" You see that? \"Plain and clear\"! And the fossils? Well, they were created by dinosaurs who drowned when they weren't allowed to get on Noah's ark. The scientists got it wrong, those fossils are just 4500 years old, not millions! Stupid scientists!\n\nIt goes on... Oh, does it ever. And you know the scary thing? This drivel is actually taught to children.\n\nThey'd be better served watching the Flintstones.",
