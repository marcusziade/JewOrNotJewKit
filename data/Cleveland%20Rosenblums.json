  "description": "When LeBron James led the Cavaliers to the NBA championship in 2016, lots of noise was made about how this was the first basketball title for Cleveland. Not so! How could everyone forget the Cleveland Rosenblums?\n\nThe Rosenblums were formed in 1919 and named after founder and department store owner Max Rosenblum. Not exactly a name that would fly in the modern NBA...\n\nThe Rosies, as they were known, were a founding member of the American Basketball League in 1925. Teams from places as varied as Buffalo and Rochester (and New York, and Boston, and Detroit) joined in the first attempt to make a national (north-eastern) basketball league. And the Rosenblums, led by Jew and future basketball Hall of Famer, Marty Friedman  (no, not the Megadeath frontman) won the first ever championship in 1926. They would end up winning two more.\n\nThe ABL lasted until 1955, slowly but surely losing relevance. By the end of its run, a different league, the BAA (later renamed to the NBA) became the premier basketball competition in America. Still, the ABL left the legacy of the Rosenblums.\n\nAnd of the Toledo Red Man Tobaccos. Seriously, some things are better left forgotten.",
