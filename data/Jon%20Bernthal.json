  "description": "You know what's the problem with prequels? You know exactly how they end.\n\nTake a look at the most famous example, \"Star Wars\". Three movies, seven hours, lots of sand, to get us to what? To the point we already know. We know Obi-Wan is not going to die. We know Padme is, but not before giving birth to Luke and Leia. We know that Anakin is going to turn into Darth Vader. Perhaps it's not the end result, but the journey? If you say so...\n\nWhich brings us to \"The Many Saints of Newark\", the long-awaited movie prequel to if not the greatest, but perhaps the most influential TV show of all time, \"The Sopranos\". We know how it's gonna end! Tony's father, Johnny Boy (Jon Bernthal: Jew. Huh.), will die. Tony's uncle, Junior (Corey Stoll: Jew. Are Italians complaining about this?), will not. Tony's mom will continue to be nasty. Tony himself will learn to evolve into what he becomes...\n\nAre we still gonna watch it?\n\nOf course.",
