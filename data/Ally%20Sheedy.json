  "description": "The Breakfast Club is over. Judd Nelson strikes that pose for eternity. What now?\n\nWell, pairs are formed, of course. The criminal and the princess (Nelson and Molly Ringwald). The athlete and the basket case (Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy, who, let's get it out of the way, is Jewish through her mother). The brain (Anthony Michael Hall) is all alone, but he is a nerd. It's expected. Even by 80s movie standards.\n\nSo what happens with the pairs? Well, Nelson and Ringwald is pretty obvious. They have a couple of weeks of torrid, dirty sex, then he runs off with a biker chick and she spends the rest of the year crying. Duh.\n\nBut what about Estevez and Sheedy? Remember, she underwent a makeover that turned her from an outsider into someone passably pretty. And he fell for it. How could he not? She had a dainty bow and everything.\n\nOur guess is that they go to the mall, and get some food, and try to talk, and quickly — very quickly — realize that they have nothing in common. That the bonding they shared in detention was brought together by closed quarters, and once that's removed, there really is not much to go on. That Estevez is just a dumb jock. That Sheedy's makeover might have changed her on the outside, but on the inside she is still dark and deeply disturbed.\n\nSo they leave the mall and go their separate ways, never speaking of that day ever again.\n\nOr maybe they have torrid, dirty sex. Who knows, right?",
