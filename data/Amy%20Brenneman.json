  "description": "We got bad news for you, dear readers. We canceled HBO.\n\nWhat does that have to do with us, you ask? Well, have you noticed how many HBO shows have led to a profile (or profiles)?\n\nThe Larry Sanders Show? Sex in the City? The Sopranos? Curb Your Enthusiasm? Big Love? Da Ali G Show? Entourage? Bored To Death? Boardwalk Empire? Girls? Veep? Arli$$? (Alas, even Arli$$... Yet, somehow, nothing about The Wire or Game of Thrones. Weird.)\n\nWell, no more. And that's quite sad, because we've had Amy Brenneman in our queue for a while. She's one of the leads on HBO's new show, The Leftovers. It's getting rave reviews and everything.\n\nIn any case, Amy is half Jewish, half goyishe, but raised Christian. The show is about the rapture, and cults, and the end of the world, and... well, we're not gonna find out.\n\nWe canceled HBO. Sorry, dear readers.",
