  "description": "So, the Super Bowl is this weekend. You might have heard. And here at Jew or Not Jew, we have a tough task ahead of us. We have to figure out which team, the New York Giants or the New England Patriots, is more Jewish.\n\nOwners: The Patriots are owned by Robert Kraft, Jew. The Giants are owned 50% by Steve Tisch, Jew, but 50% by John Mara, Not a Jew. Advantage: Patriots.\n\nCoaches: The Patriots are led by Bill Belichick, the Giants by Tom Coughlin... let's just move on.\n\nPlayers (where have you gone, Sage Rosenfels?): Everyone knows about the Patriots' wide-receiver-turned-defensive-back Julian Edelman, who is half Jewish, but raised Christian. Not everyone knows about Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich, who is half Jewish, but raised Christian. Advantage... Well, outside of football, Edelman is best known for being arrested for assault and battery, and groping a woman. Herzlich is best known for surviving cancer. Advantage: Giants.\n\nHistory: In the 80s, the Patriots were led by Hall of Famer Andre Tippett, who converted to Judaism. The Giants not only have their own Jewish Hall of Famer, Benny Friedman, who played in the 20s and 30s, but also had a Jewish coach, Allie Sherman, in the 60s. (And let's not forget Sage Rosenfels!) Advantage: Giants.\n\nCities: Boston or New York? Come on, that's not even close. Advantage: Giants.\n\nWe wouldn't have it any other way.",
