  "description": "Unfortunately, J.K. Rowling isn't the most Jew-friendly children's writer (as seen in our recently added Severus Snape posting). At least she isn't openly hostile like the devastatingly antisemitic Roald Dahl. Still, it would be nice to have a landsman among the suddenly well-fed children's book masses. Thankfully, Lemony Snicket and his \"Series of Unfortunate Events\" are here to save your little mensch's day.\n\nBecause, unfortunately, while there is no Biblical precedent for the name Lemony, it turns out it's just a nom-de-plume. The author's real name is Daniel Handler, and he is, in fact, a Jew. \n\nNow it is unfortunate that those of us at JONJ haven't read the books, or seen the unfortunately supposed mediocre film. But based on the buzz surrounding the series and the casual glances at the texts during spare moments at the bookstore we're generally predisposed towards him and his delightfully dark books.\n\nUnfortunately he's no J.K., but we still think we're fortunate to have him.",
