  "description": "Did you know that a kosher pickle is not necessarily... Kosher? Appearances can be deceiving!\n\nSay you go to your local supermarket and see a very Jewy-looking stork selling a jar of kosher pickles. It's right there on the label!\n\nWell, be careful, because capitalization is important. Here, \"kosher pickles\" just refers to a style, perfected in New York delis, that are made with garlic and dill. Theoretically, they might not be prepared in tradition with the Kosher law, despite the name. If you care, better check for that K or circled U!\n\nAlso not necessarily Kosher: that stork. Even though he is often given credit for popularizing kosher pickles, and his appearance is based on Groucho Marx, Vlasic's roots lie in the former Yugoslavia, with no Jewish origin.\n\nAppearances can be deceiving...",
