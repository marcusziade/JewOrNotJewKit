  "description": "We were talking to an Englishman the other day — a Liverpudlian, to be precise — so, naturally, the topic of football... err, soccer, came up. And, since our two loves are the beautiful game and the eternal search for Jews, we just had to ask about Ronny Rosenthal.\n\n\"Oh, that c@#t,\" the Liverpudlian said. \"I'll never forget that f@#king miss against Villa.\"\n\nSo there you have it. A talented striker, who scored a hat-trick on his first start with Liverpool, who was part of their last league-winning team, who was the first Israeli (and very likely the first Jew) to play in the Premier League... remembered for that f@#king miss.\n\nOf course, the miss is rather legendary. Rosenthal rounded the goalkeeper, and, with just an empty net in front of him, somehow hit the crossbar from close range. It's one for the all-time blooper reel, we give you that.\n\n\"So, how is your team doing?\", the Liverpudlian asked.\n\nWe sighed. That'll teach us to talk to Englishmen about soccer... err, football.",
