  "description": "We're really into \"Mad Men\" now. It's about time. The show has been on for a couple of seasons, but we discovered its greatness only recently.\n\nSo we mentioned it in the Bill Bernbach profile, and thought that that would be it for JONJ \"Mad Men\" references.\n\nOh, how wrong we were.\n\nFor, after browsing some blogs, there seemed to be a big rumor back in Season 1 that the main character, Don Draper, was secretly a Jew.\n\nDon Draper? The square-jawed, chain-smoking, hard-drinking, woman-seducing, goyish-looking dapper ad man? Jewish? Frankly, we didn't see it.\n\nAnd then we started questioning our own Jew-dar. We thought that we got so good at spotting Jews. Maybe two and a half years of writing for this website has caught up to us. Maybe it was so obvious that we just couldn't see it.\n\nSo much for self-doubt. We didn't see any Jewishness because it's just not there. The big secret turned out to be completely different. Don Draper might not be everything he seems, but he is not a Jew.\n\nUnless that's the big reveal of Season 3.",
