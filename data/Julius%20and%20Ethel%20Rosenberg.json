  "description": "In our attempt to be fair, we've profiled not only Jews that we're proud of, but also those who we can live without (a small minority, of course). And yet, if you browse through these \"Sadly, a Jew\" verdicts, many of these transgressions we're willing to let go.\n\nCorey Feldman was pretty good in \"The Goonies\". Marv Albert is one of the best sports announcers in the country. Michael Bolton once opened for Black Sabbath. And we're trying to think of something nice to say about Dustin Diamond. We're sure it's out there.\n\nNot so with the Rosenbergs. We just can't come up with anything positive. Julius was a snappy dresser? Ethel made great borscht? We don't even like borscht...\n\nNo, it all pales when pitted against selling the atomic bomb to the Soviets. No amount of borscht can salvage that.",
