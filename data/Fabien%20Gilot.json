  "description": "We've previously mentioned our disdain for goyim sporting Hebrew tattoos... we're looking at you, Justin Bieber. But sometimes, we're gonna make an exception. (No, not for Bieber, obviously.)\n\nTo the right is the tattoo of Fabien Pierre Aurelien Dominique Gilot, French swimmer. His resume is not too shabby: he has a gold and two silvers from freestyle relays in the past three Olympics. Gilot is goyishe (look at that mug; isn't he the Frenchiest Frenchman ever?), so what gives? And why are we making an exception?\n\nGilot's tattoo is Hebrew for \"I am nothing without them\". It's a tribute to Gilot's step-grandfather, Max Goldschmidt. Even though they are not related by blood, Gilot considers Goldschmidt \"a grandfather in every way\". Oh, and he is an Auschwitz survivor.\n\nSo, mad props to Gilot. And apologies for mentioning Justin Bieber in your profile...",
