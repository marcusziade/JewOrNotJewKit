  "description": "Formula 1 races have been held in some of the world's most famous cities. Barcelona, Melbourne, Monte Carlo, Montreal, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Watkins Glen.\n\nThat's Watkins Glen, New York, population 1,859. It's a pretty little town set on one of the Finger Lakes. You should visit sometime.\n\nFor years, Watkins Glen was the site of the United States Grand Prix. Drivers from all over the world would converge for one of the circuit's most prestigious races.\n\nWatkins Glen was the site of Francois Cevert's greatest triumph. The French Jew won the race in 1971, helping him to a third place finish in the yearly standings.\n\nWatkins Glen was also the site of Cevert's greatest defeat. Two years later, during a qualifying run, he crashed into the barrier, and died immediately. A year later, Austria's Helmuth Koinigg died at Watkins Glen as well.\n\nFormula 1 races are no longer held in Watkins Glen. And that's probably a good thing.",
