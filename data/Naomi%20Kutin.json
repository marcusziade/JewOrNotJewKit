  "description": "\"Supergirl.\" \"World's Strongest Teenager.\" No, we are not talking about a comic book super-heroine.\n\nThe Supergirl is Naomi Kutin, a champion power lifter. She broke an ADULT world record when she was nine... and she keeps getting better. Naomi is only 16 now, so the ceiling seems limitless.\n\nOh, and she is an Orthodox Jew. (She doesn't lift on Shabbos!) In fact, her parents had to check with their rabbi to find out if it was allowed for a girl to powerlift.\n\nThankfully, the rabbi said yes, and we got a real-life super-heroine. Much cooler than comic books!",
