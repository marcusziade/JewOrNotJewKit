  "description": "If you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, what's the worst thing you could imagine? What about being forced to watch an endless parade of children run through gallons of goop, glop and yuck?\n\nWell, that's basically what happened to Marc Summers in his best known role as the host of 90s cable phenomenon Double Dare. In the show, teams of children competed to answer trivia questions to try to win cash and prizes. But it was all just a big excuse to get messy, as even the winners eventually had to brave the obstacle course, getting shmeared in cheese, sand, hot fudge, and something that one website refers to as \"blue gak.\"\n\nAnd throughout it all, poor Marc Summers had to stand by, watch and, we assume, cringe. Because the host of the most famously sloppy show on television also had OCD. \n\nIt's like sending an asthmatic to Mexico City or having a kosher-keeping rabbi do a show about bacon.\n\nWell, Marc might also know a little bit about that last one â€” he's Jewish, after all. He's since come to grips with OCD, educating others, writing books, etc. \n\nStill, maybe best to find someone else to host your new hit game show: \"Germs, Germs, Germs!\"",
