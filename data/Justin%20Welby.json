  "description": "You might have heard, they held the papal elections recently. 100 old men sitting in a locked room, trying to decide which one is the least fallible and gets to wear a funky hat.\n\nBut we Jews decided not to throw OUR hat into the ring this time. You see, it's possible that we already count the head a major religion as one of our own. And he already has a funky hat.\n\nThat man is Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the Anglican Church. Good work if you can get it.\n\nWelby's grandfather was supposedly a German Jew, but the archbishop didn't find out about his roots until late in his life. Who knows, if the discovery was made earlier, his religious upbringing might have taken a different turn. Instead of an Anglican bishop, he might have become a rabbi or a cantor.\n\nBut then, there wouldn't be any funky hats...\n\n(Editor's update, April 9, 2016: After taking a DNA test, Welby found out that his real father was indeed NOT Jewish. Hooray for funky hats!?)",
