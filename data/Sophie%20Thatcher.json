  "description": "Hey, TV networks, we got a request for you: Can you please not make us wait over a year for a new season of a show?\n\nBack in 2021, a friend told us to watch \"Yellowjackets\". After all, it featured some of our favorite things: Soccer. New Jersey. 1990s. Survival. High School Girls. Since we don't have Showtime, we used a friend's login got a free trial and binged the whole first season in a week. It was definitely watchable, and, as we always do, we tried to find a potential Jew in the cast. (No one jumped out, except for one of the young actresses, whose middle name is Batsheba.)\n\nSo we patiently waited for Season 2, which came out after a year's gap. It wasn't as good as the first one, but still very enjoyable. (And yet, still no Yellowjackets-related profile. Go figure. You'd think that every show we ever watch ends up being referenced here. Not so, apparently.)\n\nAnd now we wait for Season 3. And wait. And wait. Apparently, it's not gonna come out until 2025. We don't even remember what happened! We think a major character died at the end of Season 2, but... did they? We're not sure, and we definitely can't tell you which one. And who is even that actress who we thought might be Jewish? Sophie Thatcher? Ella Purnell? Sophie Nelisse? Too many Sophies!\n\nApparently, it's Sophie Batsheba Thatcher, who is not Jewish. Other than \"Yellowjackets\", you might have seen her in what was supposed to be a pivotal role on the mostly-unwatchable \"The Book of Boba Fett\".\n\nWe're not sure if they are making a new season of that one, and, frankly, we're not waiting.",
