  "description": "Let's say you're in middle America and have hankering for a bagel. There are no Jews around, so where are you gonna go? What about Einstein Bros Bagels... that sounds Jewish, doesn't it? And they have locations in pretty much every state! (Alas, not in Montana or North Dakota...)\n\nWell, we got bad news for you. Einstein Bros only SOUNDS Jewish (perhaps that the cheese-and-bacon-filled monstrosity that headlines their website should have been our first clue). The chain was created by the fast-food corporation Boston Market back in 1995, when they bought four local chains from places that did not exactly scream \"good bagels\". (Salt Lake City?!?!?!) And for a name? Well, what's more Jewy than \"Einstein\"? (Perhaps \"Einstein and Noah\", which it was before they added the Bros.)\n\nIt gets worse. Oh, much worse. In 2014, the company was taken over by the German conglomerate JAB, which also owns Krispy Kreme and Panera. It recently came out that JAB's founders were Nazi collaborators and antisemites who used prison labor during World War II. Oomph.\n\nIn present time, JAB is actually doing the responsible thing and is donating over $5 million to Holocuast survivors. That being said, if you're in middle America and have hankering for a bagel...\n\nDon't.",
