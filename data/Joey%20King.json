  "description": "Actress Joey King has been in the tabloids recently. Allegedly, the star of \"Bullet Train\" (a pretentious attempt to mimic Tarantino if we ever saw one) is having an affair with co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson. She is engaged, he is married. Oh, the humanity!\n\nIt's not the alleged affair that has our interest piqued. It's the age difference. Sure, Taylor-Johnson is \"just\" nine years older, but King has been acting since childhood. We first remember seeing her as Colin Hanks' very Jewish daughter on the first season of \"Fargo\", when she was in her early teens. So, if Taylor-Johnson also saw that same series... You know, best not to think about it.\n\nWhat we should think about is that they make a very Jewy couple: Joey matches her \"Fargo\" character, and Taylor-Johnson is a MOT as well.\n\nSomeone who should be thinking about it is Taylor-Johnson's wife, Samantha, who is 23 years Aaron's senior! Which, when compared to King's age... Oh, the humanity!",
