  "description": "This one's for all the ladies.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we wrote in the Brendan Fraser profile that playing a Jew in a movie doesn't make one a Jew.\n\nBut what if one plays a Jew in three movies, you ask? Because with the current release of \"Defiance\", dream crush Daniel Craig has now played a Polish Jewish guerilla fighter, an American Jewish soldier (in \"Fateless\") and a Jewish Mossad (in \"Munich\"). And that just has you salivating with anticipation.\n\nSo, is there something to it? Is there a hint of Judaism hidden in those smoldering blue eyes? Perhaps we finally found our Jewish James Bond?\n\nWe have not. Typecasting or not, Daniel Craig is not Jewish. Sorry.\n\nSo, attractive female Jewish readers of JONJ (and if you're Jewish, female and reading JONJ, then you're attractive), here is your mission: fly to England. Pry Mr. Craig from whatever supermodel he's currently dating. Then marry him, make sure that he converts to Judaism, and have a lot of blond, steely-eyed, Jewish babies.\n\n(Editor's update, June 22, 2011: Way to go, Rachel Weisz!)",
