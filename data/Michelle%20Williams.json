  "description": "Sigh. Here we go again.\n\nApparently, some Jews out there are not too happy with Steve Spielberg. Yes, Steven Spielberg, the torchbearer for all that is great and Jewy! (This is not about \"Munich\". Some Jews are still not happy about \"Munich\".)\n\nThis is about \"The Fabelmans\", Spielberg's semi-autobiographical hit film. You see, he had the nerve to cast gentile actors in Jewish roles! How could such obvious goys as Paul Dano and Michelle Williams pass as the Spiel... err, the Fabelmans!?\n\nNow, this is not new ground for us, but let's take a crack at it again. Point #1: You would think that STEVEN SPIELBERG would know which actors could pass as HIS parents, right? Point #2: Let's take a look at Michelle Williams. She is currently married to a Jew. She is studying Judaism in order to raise her children Jewish. That's more Jewy than most so-called real Jews! Point #3: If only Jews are allowed to play Jewish roles, should only goyim be allowed to play goyishe ones? Because we tell you what, Jewish actors will be out of work pretty soon...\n\nSigh.",
