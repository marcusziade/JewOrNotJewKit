  "description": "Superhero movies are all the rage nowadays (At least they were until recently? It seems people are more or less over them now?), but that wasn't always the case. Israeli producer Menahem Golan tried to get a Spider-Man movie off the ground for a large chunk of the 1980s. (Dolph Lundgren as the Green Goblin? Ohhhh... kay!?)\n\nGolan had to settle for a really bad version of \"Captain America\" (already mentioned in the Matt Salinger profile), as well \"Super-Man IV\" and \"Masters of the Universe\". He also produced dozens of B-(C-?)movies, such as the \"Death Wish\" series with Charles Bronson, the \"American Ninja\" series (already mentioned in the Sam Firstenberg profile!), and such classics as \"The Last American Virgin\", \"Hard Rock Zombies\", and \"Detective School Dropouts\". Truly a career for the ages.\n\nHe also directed \"Over the Top\". Yes, THAT \"Over the Top\". Is there any other?\n\n\"Over the Top\" is a time-tested tale of a truck driver down on his luck. To win back his son, he needs to win an... arm wrestling competition. It starred the one and only Sylvester Stallone! If that's not the most 80s thing ever made, then we're not sure what is. (\"Masters of the Universe\", perhaps?)\n\nIn Israel, Golan was actually an esteemed filmmaker, with numerous prestigious awards to his name. That being said, considering the schlock he produced in America, it's probably best he was kept away from Spider-Man?",
