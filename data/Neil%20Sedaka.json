  "description": "Did you know that, at one point, Neil Sedaka had Britain's top-selling single of the 21st century?\n\nYes, that Neil Sedaka. The somewhat surprisingly Jewish one. The one who was quite popular in the late 1950s and early 60s, before a little band called \"The Beatles\" kicked in.\n\nYes, that 21st century. The one whose years start with \"20\". This is for someone who hasn't sniffed the charts since the 1970s. (And never in Britain. Somehow, Sedaka was big in Japan and Italy.)\n\nYes, that Britain. The one in Europe with Northern Ireland attached. Apparently, the Brits re-released Sedaka's \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\", originally written in 1971, inserted a bunch of celebrity cameos, and it rose all the way to #1 in the charts.\n\nWhy would the Brits even want to know where Amarillo is?",
