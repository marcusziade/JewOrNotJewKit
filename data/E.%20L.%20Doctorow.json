  "description": "Do you want to lose some money? Of course, you don't! But if you do, here's a very easy way:\n\nBet on the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nOh, it's very possible. Every year bookies lay out the odds on various Nobels. The literature one is the most popular.\n\nSo why will you lose some money? Because these oddsmakers are ALWAYS WRONG. For the last few years, the supposed odds-on favorite has been Haruki Murakami. He has the profile: somewhat exotic, widely read, critically acclaimed. He hasn't won, of course. For whatever reason, literature Nobels favor more obscure nominees.\n\nWho else is constantly up the charts? Let's limit it to American authors for ease of selection: Philip Roth. Joyce Carol Oates. Bob Dylan, believe it or not. Thomas Pynchon. E.L. Doctorow. Yes, Doctorow, widely considered one of the greatest modern novelists, author of \"Ragtime\" and \"Billy Bathgate\", is available to bet on at 50/1 odds. We guarantee he won't win, however, as he happens to be... dead.\n\nSeriously, don't bet on the Nobel for Literature...",
