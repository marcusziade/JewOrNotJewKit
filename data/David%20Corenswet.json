  "description": "The new Superman is Jewish. Why haven't we profiled him yet?\n\nA few reasons, actually.\n\nFirst of all, the movie is not out yet. And if we know anything about how Warner Bros operates, it might be shelved. Or he might be replaced by someone else. Stranger things have happened with that studio.\n\nSecond of all, who the hell is he anyway? David Corenswet? We honestly have never heard of him before, even though he had roles on \"The Politician\" and \"We Own This City\", both shows that we do not remember seeing him on.\n\nThird of all, we're pretty damn tired of all the superhero fare. Marvel, DC, whatever. Yawn. Same old, same old. Enough already!\n\nFourth of all... Superman has always been Jewish. We wrote that profile back in 2006.",
