  "description": "Let's talk about feces.\n\nExcrement, dung, duty, dookie, poop, stool, turd, crap, shit. Dreck.\n\nManure, specifically. Because for centuries people had to use animal feces to fertilize their crops.\n\nWhich is all fine and good if you have a small farm and, say, a couple of cows. Cows defecate, you use the manure as fertilizer to grow grass for cows to eat. Such is the circle of life.\n\nBut let's say you have a large farm. Fields of corn, wheat, etc. And there are just not enough cows in the world to fertilize it. And if there were... trust us, you wouldn't want to be around THAT.\n\nSo what do you do? Buy synthetic fertilizer, of course. And thanks to whom does synthetic fertilizer exist? Well, Jewish German chemist Fritz Haber, who, together with compatriot Carl Bosch, developed the Haber process, which allowed the formation of ammonia and creation of fertilizer. He got the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his efforts.\n\nSadly, Haber was also known as the \"father of chemical warfare\" for creation of poison gasses during World War I... But by then, he had already converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1892.\n\nWhat a load of feces.",
