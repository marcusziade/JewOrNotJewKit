  "description": "From the Harry Potter wiki, our comments parenthesized:\n\nGoblins are short (yep) and fair-skinned (for the most part), as they spend very little time outside (definitely).\n\nThey have very long fingers and feet (?????), dome shaped heads (yep) and are slightly larger than house-elves (that sounds right).\n\nGriphook, one of the hundreds of goblins working at Gringotts, has a bald head (yep), pointed nose (ugh... yep), and pointed ears (maybe?).\n\nSome have dark, slanted eyes (dark, sure), and some goblins even wear pointed hats (have you seen Jewish hats from the middle ages???).\n\nOh, and goblins run the only bank in the Wizarding world (yep), have their own code of ethics (yep), and are portrayed as greedy (shrug).\n\nIs \"Hopefully, Not a Jew\" in our verdict matrix?",
