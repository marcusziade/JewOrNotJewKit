  "description": "We were watching a Woody Allen film recently, when an actress with a very familiar nasal voice entered the scene.\n\n\"That's Marge Simpson!\", we yelled.\n\n\"Oh, can we just watch it in peace?\", said the wife. \"It's not enough that half the time you interrupt movies by checking if actors are Jewish...\"\n\n\"Speaking of that... hold on a second,\" we said.\n\nYep, Julie Kavner, the actress who appeared in numerous Allen films, but is mostly known for her portrayal of Marge Simpson, is Jewish. In fact, three of the six major Simpsons voice actors are: Kavner, Harry Shearer, and Hank Azaria.\n\nThat second has passed, we better wrap it up quickly!",
