  "description": "NBC is awful.\n\nWe wanted to watch the women's triple jump final, which featured Hanna Knyazyeva-Minenko of Israel. She previously competed for Ukraine, finishing 4th in the 2012 Olympics. Here was her chance to top that and medal.\n\nUnfortuantely, we could not watch her performance. Despite controlling a multitude of channels, NBC chooses to limit its television coverage. What makes it even worse is that they often forego live events in favor of taped, or (what's much worse) human interest stories. We don't need to put this in context, NBC. Just show the damn sport.\n\nWhy didn't you watch online, you ask? Oh, we tried to... on NBC's website. Unfortunately, there was only one channel shared by track and field, so the triple jump often lost out to various running heats. We had to piece Hanna's performance in between other events.\n\nAlas, despite posting her best distance all year, she finished 5th, and, alas, she isn't Jewish, despite competing for Israel and wearing the Star of David. Nevertheless, this is Israel's best track and field performance ever, so we decided to give Hanna her due.\n\nWe aren't as awful as NBC.",
