  "description": "Which woman has won the most Oscars?\n\nThat's easy, Katharine Hepburn! Wait a minute, Jew or Not Jew... This is not a profile of Katharine Hepburn! What kind of tricks are you playing?\n\nNo tricks. Note how we didn't say \"acting\" Oscars. If we did, Hepburn would be the queen, natch.\n\nNo, the woman who has won the most Oscars is costume designer Edith Head. Her eight leaves Hepburn's four in the dust.\n\nHead, all 5'1\" of her, clothed Hollywood's elite for over four decades. Mae West, Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Rita Hayworth, Natalie Wood, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly... even Katharine Hepburn. Her first Oscar came in 1950. Her last, in 1974.\n\nAnd, yes, Jewish (born Edith Posener)... but became a Catholic. The trick is on us!",
