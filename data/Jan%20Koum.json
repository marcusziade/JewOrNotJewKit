It's so lame!\" Only they use a different word for \"lame\".\n\nOK, fine, we're not on Facebook either. But what about...\n\n\"I'm not on Instagram,\" kids say. \"Instagram used to be cool, but it's pretty lame now!\" Again, a different word for \"lame\".\n\nOK, fine, we're not on Instagram either. But what about...\n\n\"Hell, yeah, we're on WhatsApp!\"\n\nErr... kids? And not just kids, for WhatsApp (originally created by Jan Koum, an Ukrainian-American Jew) has become the favored method of communication in many, many countries throughout the world...\n\nWhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook: it's all the same thing.",
