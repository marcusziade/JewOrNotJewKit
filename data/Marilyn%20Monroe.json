  "description": "There is some debate on whether people who convert to Judaism are real Jews. Whenever we get asked that question, our answer is two words:\n\nMarilyn Monroe.\n\nNow, we get where the detractors are coming from. Our ancestors have suffered for centuries, and here all these Johnny-come-latelies who want in on the fun without the years of sacrifice. (Although, what fun? Our most important holiday is the Day of Atonement. And have you tried gefilte fish?)\n\nBut how can we say no to Marilyn Monroe?\n\nHere is arguably the world's biggest sex symbol — ever — who signed up to be Jewish. By choice. (She converted when she married Arthur Miller. And stayed Jewish after the divorce. Maybe she really liked gefilte fish.) Why on earth would we deny someone like that?\n\nAnd sure, if we take Marilyn, we have to take the whole lot, the Tom Arnolds and the Elizabeth Taylors of this world. And that's fine. For Marilyn Monroe is one of us.\n\nOne could do worse, that's for sure.",
