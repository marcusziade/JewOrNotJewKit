  "description": "Dear Jew or Not Jew,\n\nI know that you have discussed various casting atrocities at length on your website, but I feel this has to be said. You must have seen the trailer for \"Maestro\", the movie that is coming out later this year. There's Oscar buzz about it already!\n\n\"Maestro\", of course, is the biopic of conductor Leonard Bernstein. It's about time, I say! One of the great giants of American music is going to get his due on the silver screen! And it's produced by Steve Spielberg AND Martin Scorsese... WOW!\n\nOne small problem, however. Well, one big problem. The movie was written by, directed by, and is starring Bradley Cooper in a titular role. You know where this is going, right?\n\nMr. Cooper is an incredibly talented actor with incredible range. He can play anyone from a space raccoon to the Elephant Man to a Philadelphia Eagles fan. I'm just not sure he is the right choice to play Bernstein. I understand that \"Maestro\" is a passion project for Cooper, it just comes down to one simple thing...\n\nBradley Cooper is not a conductor!",
