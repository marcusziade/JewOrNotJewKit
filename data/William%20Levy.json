  "description": "For the love of G-d, we can't figure out why people want us to profile William Levy. Of course, it would help to know which one.\n\nThere is William Levy, the author. He wrote something called \"Natural Jewboy\", so he is probably Jewish, but seems rather obscure.\n\nThere is William Levy, the architect. Jewish, adopted his middle name Alexander as his last. Nothing too interesting.\n\nThere is William Levy, the 19th century congressman from Louisiana. Doesn't look to be Jewish, and we rarely profile current congressmen, so why start with arcane ones?\n\nThere is William Auerbach-Levy, the caricaturist. Hmmm. A bit esoteric, but perhaps? Definitely Jewish, too.\n\nThere is William Levy, the Cuban-born actor of Mexican telenovellas. He does have a Jewish grandparent, but is a practicing Catholic. But why would anyone want us to profile him?\n\nOh. He is on \"Dancing with the Stars\". Lame.\n\nShould have gone with the caricaturist.",
