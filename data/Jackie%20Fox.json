  "description": "We were watching Jeopardy! the other day (that network TV is still good for something), when two-time champion Jackie casually mentioned during the interview portion that she was a member of the 70s band, The Runaways. Interesting, we thought. Shouldn't this be a bigger deal that she is making it out to be? After all, The Runaways were rather famous (Joan Jett, et al), while it took Jackie a whole three episodes to mention that past. (Her previous bio snippets were something about walking on hot coals and being called Malibu Barbie â€” more interesting than 95% of other Jeopardy! contestant stories, but still.)\n\nSo we quickly fired off Google and the answer was right there. Jackie Fuchs, attorney and writer from Los Angeles, was also known as Jackie Fox, bassist of The Runaways (and what do you know, Jewish!). She was an original member of the band, but has reduced her association, even not allowing her name to be used in a biopic. A few years ago, Jackie revealed a terrible back story: she was raped by producer Kim Fowley while the other band members watched...\n\nUgh. Now we know why she wasn't so eager to bring it up.",
