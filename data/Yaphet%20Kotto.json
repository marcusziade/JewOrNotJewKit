  "description": "Hey, it's THAT guy!\n\nWe remember Kotto as the token black man in the movie \"Alien\". And as the villainous Mr. Big in Roger Moore's first outing as James Bond, \"Live and Let Die\". If you're a fan of \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" (all six of you), you probably know him as Lieutenant Al Giardello. In any case, if you are a consumer of the various visual media produced by this society, you can bet your bottom dollar you've seen him somewhere.\n\nBorn in good ol' NYC (just like this profile!), Kotto is actually descended from Cameroon royalty. He's been acting one way or another since age 19 and also works as a writer.\n \nOh yeah, and he's also a practicing, full-blooded Jew.\n\nNow that's the kind of plot twist worthy of the many productions you've probably seen Yaphet Kotto in.",
