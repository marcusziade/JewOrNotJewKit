  "description": "Well, you knew it was bound to happen.\n\nIf there were going to be rappers, you had to know there would eventually be a Jewish one. And if you were going to have one Jewish rapper, well, you had to assume you'd get more than one. And with more than one Jewish rapper then it was inevitable that we'd get a Jewish rapper feud, or in rap terminology, a beef (good thing, too. If they had called it a crab we couldn't have one).\n\nIn this case, Hasidic Jewish rapper/reggae \"star\" Matisyahu recently dissed hip hop \"star\" and Degrassi graduate Drake for, of all things, not being Jewish enough. And we quote:\n\n\"He happens to be Jewish, just like Bob Dylan happens to be Jewish, just like anyone happens to be Jewish. What I'm doing is really tapping into my roots and culture and trying to blend that with mainstream society and culture. So his being Jewish is just a byproduct, really. He's not representing that.\"\n\nOuch.\n\nWell, this is cute and all but there's one more inevitability here: one of these \"talented\" young men gunned down in front of the 2nd Ave Deli (located on 3rd Ave just to mess with the tourists) in NYC one fateful night after Drake questions the quality of Matisyahu's mother's matzoh balls or somesuch.\n\nSo here's hoping common sense prevails and these two find a way to patch up their differences. After all, a beef is really only good if it's corned and served on rye with mustard.",
