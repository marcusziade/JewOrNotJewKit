  "description": "Rabbi Hyman: Think! Think! We need to come up with some fancy mythical creatures!\n\nRabbi Zalman: Why?\n\nRabbi Hyman: Why? All other religions can have mythical creatures, so why not us Jews? You think we are special or something?\n\nRabbi Zalman: Well, actually...\n\nRabbi Hyman: Oh my G-d, Zalman! Just use that big brain of yours!\n\nRabbi Zalman: You know my friend Gerald?\n\nRabbi Hyman: The black fellow?\n\nRabbi Zalman: Yes, from Nubia. He tells of great fat beasts with little ears. They live in rivers but come ashore as well. When they do, the whole ground shakes! The open their mouth so wide...\n\nRabbi Hyman: Great, great, we'll call these... the Behemoth. Come on, we'll need a couple more.\n\nRabbi Zalman: Have you heard of eels?\n\nRabbi Hyman: Water snakes?\n\nRabbi Zalman: Yes, but think bigger! Very long water snakes who can stun you with one touch...\n\nRabbi Hyman: Ooh, good one. Everyone is afraid of snakes, but huge ones who swim? People will be terrified to go into the sea! We'll call this one... the Leviathan. One more, Zalman!\n\nRabbi Zalman: Well, since we already have a mammal and a fish... I heard of this flightless bird that runs very fast and sticks its head in the sand...\n\nRabbi Hyman: A bird that can't fly? No one will ever believe that one! What about a half-lion half-eagle?\n\nRabbi Zalman: A griffin? Don't the goyim have that already?\n\nRabbi Hyman: A GIANT griffin?\n\nRabbi Zalman: Are those even real?\n\nRabbi Hyman: Who cares if they are real! We'll just call it the Ziz.",
