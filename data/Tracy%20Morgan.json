  "description": "In our profile of Chris Kattan, written all the way back in 2008...\n\nYou remember Chris Kattan, right? He was a bit more topical in 2008, but was already heading down the slope of irrelevance. In any case, in our profile of Chris Kattan, we lamented the lack of prominent Jewish SNL stars, ending with the statement \"Maybe someone should research Bill Murray's ancestry?\"\n\nWell, we can't have Bill Murray (who is 100% Irish), but you know who researched his ancestry? Tracy Morgan! (He actually spent exactly the same time on SNL as Kattan: 1996 through 2003.) Tracy is actually 1/16 Jewish, and it comes from his maternal grandmother's side, so if you want to stretch it a bit...\n\nSo, what has Tracy been up to lately? He had that rather prominent stint on \"30 Rock\", but that was over a decade ago. He now seems to be slipping to irrelevance as well.\n\nMaybe someone should research Phil Hartman's ancestry?",
