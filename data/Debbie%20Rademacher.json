  "description": "So, the Women's World Cup came and went (Hooray USA!), but where are our profiles? When the men's tournament was going on last year, we dug up soccer Jews past and current. We even created an All-Time World Cup Jewish XI! Where's the love for the women?\n\nHere's the thing: we'd love to have some love for the women, but, unfortunately, finding Jewish female World Cuppers is not exactly easy. We struck out with the current American team (Ali Krieger, Meghan Klingenberg: Not a Jew), and the one known Jew from the past we already profiled (1999 champ Sara Whalen). Outside of her...\n\nHere's one, and we have to go back to the first Women's World Cup in 1991. One of the members of the champion American team was Debbie Belkin (now better known as Debbie Rademacher), Jew. After retiring as a player, she spent over two decades coaching at the University of Michigan.\n\nSo, that's two all-time Jewish female World Cuppers, and they were both champions, a 100% success rate. Take that, Jewish World Cup men?",
