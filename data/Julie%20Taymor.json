  "description": "We don't know much about Broadway musicals... Okay, we know very little about Broadway musicals... Fine, the only thing we know about Broadway musicals is that when the wife asks to go to a show, pick the one with the least amount of songs. Or convince her to see a play. That's always a worthy compromise.\n\nSo the odds of us profiling a Broadway musical director are quite unlikely. Even an acclaimed one such as Julie Taymor â€” the first woman to win a directing Tony. (She's also done films: the Frida Kahlo biopic and a couple of takes on Shakespeare.)\n\nYet here we are. For Taymor presided over one of the biggest disasters in Broadway musical history, \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\".\n\nYes, someone out there thought that that making Spider-Man into a musical was a great idea. It became the most expensive musical in Broadway history... and never made it out of previews. \"Spider-Man\" turned into an unimaginable mess with a tangled nonsensical storyline, terrible songs, and, what's worse, multiple actors injuring themselves on stage. It was so bad that the show's opening kept being pushed back and back, the content continued to be rewritten and rewritten, until Taymor was pushed off the project, with \"Spider-Man\" being shelved for a complete re-tooling.\n\nBut at least that got her profiled on our website.\n\nSo it's not a total loss?",
