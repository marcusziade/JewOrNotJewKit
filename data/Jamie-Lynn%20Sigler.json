  "description": "We admit it. We are not only Jews. We are Jews from New Jersey.\n\nOf course, we are New Jersey patriots. So for as much as we bash our state among ourselves, we will defend it to the death when others attack it. Especially because of what Jersey knowledge is limited to for out-of-staters: turnpike exits. And \"The Sopranos\".\n\nWith the famed show soon ending its run, we dug deep to find a Jewish connection among its principals. No, neither James Gandolfini nor Eddie Falco nor Michael Imperioli are Jewish. But Jamie-Lynn Sigler is.\n\nOf course, she doesn't look Jewish at all; that face has \"Italian shiksa\" written all over it. But \"Sigler\" serves a hint of her true roots, especially now that Jamie-Lynn switched it back from her short-lived married name, \"DiScala\". In fact, she is 100% Jewish; her Cuban mother converting to Judaism, and Meadow herself was bat mitzvahed and went to Hebrew school.\n\nHowever, only Sigler's character is from Jersey; the actress herself was born in Queens. But who needs her! It's not like we have a problem finding a real New Jersey Jew we can be proud of. Who needs Meadow Soprano when you have Jon Stewart?",
