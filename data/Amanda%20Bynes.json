  "description": "Young Amanda Bynes is half Jewish, half Catholic, and says about religion that \"I haven't decided yet\". So, we're here to help out!\n\n\nCatholicsJews\nReligion LeaderThe PopeNone\nAdvantage: Jews. Go to G-d. Go directly to G-d. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.\nBiggest DisasterThe Irish Potato FamineBarbra Streisand\nAdvantage: Catholics. Not even close.\nSpring HolidayEasterPassover\nAdvantage: Jews. Marshmallow peeps taste like cardboard. Plus, have you seen what the goyim wear on Easter? Sheesh.\nWinter HolidayChristmasChanukah\nAdvantage: Push. Sure, Christmas is celebrated by millions, has become synonymous with happiness in American culture and has tons and tons of gifts but Chanukah has... something... we think...\nCrackersCommunion WafersMatzah\nAdvantage: No one. Because when we eat crackers, no one wins.\nMadonnaMother of JesusWanna-be Jew\nAdvantage: Catholics. Sigh. You're welcome to  take her back now, by the way.\nSunday School TeachersNuns with RulersCantors with Guitars\nAdvantage: Jews. To be fair, the nuns with rulers are only slightly more painful, but it's enough.\nChurch or Temple LeaderPriestRabbi\nAdvantage: Jews. (Comment about priests removed to not offend our Catholic readers.)\n\n\nWell, it's pretty close, but at the end it's abundantly clear that... What's this? Amanda has already described herself as Jewish? That's great, except... Now what are we going to do with our wonderful chart!?",
