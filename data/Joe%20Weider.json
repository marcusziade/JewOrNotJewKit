  "description": "Recently, the four-year-old has acquired a new word that is used to describe everything from unsavory meals to bad weather to ugly people (forgive him, he is four): \"Disgusting!\". And his whole face twists into a grouchy grimace, as if the potatoes on his plate are the Devil's making. They are not.\n\nWe can understand.\n\nFor even now, when that precarious age is long lost in life's rearview mirror, there is one thing that still makes us throw up in our mouth every time we look at it. No, not potatoes. Our wife's potatoes are perfectly edible! Honestly!\n\nBodybuilding.\n\nObviously not everybody feels the same way. Heck, love of bodybuilding is not even restricted to goyim; Joe Weider, Jew, is the creator of Mr. and Ms. Olympia, as well as publisher of various magazines. Magazines where page after page are filled with bulging, grotesque, unnatural, frankensteinian people...\n\nDisgusting!\n\n...Yet obvious where the four-year-old gets it from.",
