  "description": "A year and a half ago, we wrote a profile of disc jockey Alan Freed, claiming that Jews invented rock and roll. Or at least the term \"rock and roll\". Because, as we all know, there would be no rock and roll without Elvis. Who might or might not have been part Jewish. Which we also wrote about already.\n\nBut did you know that Elvis owes much of his success to a couple of Jews named Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller?\n\nWhat are Elvis' most popular songs? \"Hound Dog\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\", right? And who wrote those songs? No, not Elvis himself, but rather the Jewish songwriting duo of Leiber and Stoller. Aha!\n\nWe're exaggerating a bit here, of course. Even without \"Dog\" and \"Rock\" Elvis would have still been Elvis, just with fewer hits. But did you know that Leiber and Stoller wrote numerous hits for other artists as well, including \"Stand by Me\", that has been recorded and re-recorded by musicians as diverse as Ben E. King, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and Mickey Gilley?\n\nSo, fine. Maybe Jews didn't exactly invent rock and roll. But they sure had a big part in its creation, didn't they?",
