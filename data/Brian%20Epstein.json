  "description": "Who was the Fifth Beatle? Opinions vary.\n\nAccording to Paul McCartney, the title should belong to the band's manager Brian Epstein, who was absolutely essential in its rise to the top. Epstein overdosed in 1967 at the age of 32, and let's just say that the Beatles did not exactly last long after that.\n\nIf it was only that simple! After naming Epstein as the Fifth Beatle, McCartney later gave the title to producer George Martin. On the other hand, George Harrison decided to bestow it on Derek Taylor, the band's PR man, and Neil Aspinall, their road manager. We're at the Eighth Beatle already, and we haven't gotten to Pete Best!\n\nHow can we forget Pete Best (many have forgotten Pete Best), who was the band's original drummer before Epstein fired him on a request from John Lennon. Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, which means the Fifth Beatle is... not Best, but Ringo?\n\nIt's not Ringo. Few realize that the Beatles actually started as a five-man band, with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. Sadly, Sutcliffe died from a brain hemorrhage at the age of 21. McCartney took over on bass, and the band was reduced to four (including Best, before Ringo). So, if we were gonna bestow the title on anyone, it would be... Sutcliffe?\n\nLet's just stick with Epstein. He is the only one mentioned here that was Jewish!",
