  "description": "With over 1000 profiles under our belt, we have quite a few relatives profiled. From fathers/sons (Jerry and Ben Stiller, etc) to mothers/daughters (Goldie Hawn and Kate Hudson, etc) to numerous husband/wife combinations (Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, etc, etc, etc).\n\nBut we don't have any families other than... the Clintons. No, neither Bill, Hillary, or Chelsea are Jewish, but somehow we found a reason to give each of them a profile. So let's rectify that.\n\nWe've already profiled Shirley Povich. We've already profiled Connie Chung. So let's add Shirley's son and Connie's husband Maury Povich to complete a profiled, Jewish family.\n\nMaury, of course, was an early pioneer of tabloid TV \"journalism\" after his stint on \"A Current Affair\", before launching his own talk show. After some attempt at respectability, it descended into Springer-like levels (as far as we understand it, every other episode involves a paternity test).\n\nSo there you have it, the Poviches. Award-winning journalist Shirley, and tabloid talking heads Maury and Connie. Hmmm. Maybe we should get to profiling Jerry Stiller's wife and Ben's mother Anne Meara sooner rather than later?",
