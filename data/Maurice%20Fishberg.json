  "description": "Are Jews an ethnicity? We've spent 13 years on this very website arguing so, but we're not exactly scientific about it. We're not Maurice Fishberg.\n\nFishberg, a medical doctor and anthropologist, spent his life researching Jews. It was all in his 1911 opus, \"Jews: A Study of Race and Environment\". \n\nAmong Fishberg's research was disproving the myth of the Jewish nose. Fishberg looked at 4,000 (Not a typo! How did he find so many Jews who wanted to be examined? Did he go door to door? Newspaper ad?) and came to the conclusion that only 14% fall under the hooked category. So much for the stereotype.\n\nFishberg's research went beyond the nose, natch, studying all aspects of various Jewish traits. His conclusion? That Jews are not as unique ethnically as some believe. Obviously, we don't agree...\n\nBut maybe we should listen to man who looked at FOUR THOUSAND noses?",
