  "description": "Can Jews be trailer trash? Apparently so.\n\nSo even though she was born Jewish, it's very hard to imagine Roseanne sitting down for Passover Seder, her head covered with a scarf, sipping on Manischewitz. No, it's much easier to picture her in a middle of a trailer, popping open a TV dinner, slurping Pabst Blue Ribbon.\n\nIt gets even more complicated. Yes, her family was Jewish, but  somehow, it was involved in Mormonism as well. Then she became both a kaballist and a follower of Jesus Christ. Now she is back to reclaiming her Jewish heritage.\n\nAnd we are fine with that. If Roseanne wants to return to being Jewish, that's fine. Just make sure to stock up on TV dinners when she visits.",
