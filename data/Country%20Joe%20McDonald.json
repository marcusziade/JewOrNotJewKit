  "description": "How did psychedelic rock musician Country Joe McDonald get his name? Let's start in the back.\n\n\"McDonald\": even though Joe's mother was Jewish, his father was goyishe, hence the Mc-monicker.\n\n\"Joe\": he was named after Joseph Stalin! McDonald's parents were communists, who decided to name their son after their favorite dictator. They ended up rejecting communism, but the name already stuck.\n\n\"Country\": comes back to Stalin, as well. \"Country Joe\" was a nickname for the mustached psychopath. In fact, McDonald's band, Country Joe and the Fish, alludes to two communist leaders, with \"the fish\" referencing a famous Mao quote.\n\nBetter than \"Fish Mao McDonald\", we give you that.",
