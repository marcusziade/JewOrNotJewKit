  "description": "So, ummmm, remember when we wrote the G-d profile waaaaaaaay back in the spring of 2008 and we were terrified of getting smited? Smoten? Smoted? Whatever? Does it say something that we're actually a little more worried about what will happen when we write this one? \n\nOK. Here goes.\n\nSemion Mogilevich is a very nice man who was born to Jewish parents in Kyiv. In the 1980s he helped a bunch of Russian and Ukranian Jews escape to Israel, often while transferring many of their harder to move possessions for them.\n\nHe later became the head of Inkombank, one of the largest financial institutions of Russia, where he was accused of money laundering. Which is good, because who likes having dirty money, right? It should be clean so as not to stain one's hands or clothing...\n\nMogilevich is currently on the FBI's Ten \"Most Wanted\" list, but we're sure that's just a big misunderstanding. Or something.\n\nYup. Nothing else to see here.\n\nQuick, totally unrelated note: if the site suddenly stops updating after this post, run — don't walk — to the nearest police station and report it. Seriously, totally, 100% not kidding. Our wives and families, those that remain, will appreciate it. Thanks.",
