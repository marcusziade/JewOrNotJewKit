  "description": "Well here we ago with yet ANOTHER Jewish stereotype.\n\nFrankly, we're getting a little sick of you, Mr. Jewish Hockeyplayerberg. \n\nLook, everyone knows that the letters N-H-L are synonymous with J-E-W. After all, is there a Jewish child who doesn't remember their mothers straightening their yarmulke with one hand while tying up their skate laces with the other?\n\nAnd who didn't skip out on Hebrew school for a little pick-up on the frozen pond behind the shul?\n\nBut why is it so hard to find one studious, even slightly-nerdy Jew among the battle-hardened, athletic, ice hockey playing masses? After all, is breaking the hockey stick over one's knee the same as smashing the Ten Commandments?\n\nApparently.\n\nSo, congrats Mr. Mathieu Schneider, Stanley Cup winner, all-star defenseman, on being yet another Jewish hockey player and reinforcing this ridiculous stereotype of the Chosen people.\n\nWhy couldn't you have been a trendsetter and gone into something like comedy or banking instead?",
