  "description": "We thoroughly enjoyed \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\", even though the plot is a little thin... well, very thin. We did enjoy it!\n\nOf course, seeing (spoiler alert!) three Spider-Men together was the absolute highlight. However, we were somewhat disappointed with the selection of villains they brought back from previous films.\n\nNo, this is not about James Franco! (For many reasons, it's not about James Franco...) It's also not about Paul Giamatti, for starring as the Rhino in the worst Spider-Man movie of it all was truly the apex of the thespian's career. (NOT!) Why was the lame Sandman brought back from \"Spider-Man 3\"? Where was Venom? It's not like Topher Grace is super busy nowadays! (Topher Grace: a quarter Jewish, if you're wondering.)\n\nNow, we know what you're saying. \"Spider-Man 3\" was not exactly good, and the current Spidey universe already has a perfectly cromulent Venom in Tom Hardy. But isn't this all about universe splicing? Wouldn't it be cool if Hardy's Venom met Grace's Verom? Hell, they can even absorb each other...\n\nPerhaps they are saving that for the Venom sequel?",
