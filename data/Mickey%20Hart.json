  "description": "Every band has an easily-determined hierarchy. It always goes like this:\n\nIt starts with guitar. Lead guitar is obviously first, followed by rhythm and then bass. Keyboard is next, and then drums. Drums is always last.\n\nLet's take the Grateful Dead. Clearly, it begins with Jerry Garcia. Then we go down the list to Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Pigpen McKernan, and finally get to drums and Bill Kreutzmann. Mickey Hart? See, even we forgot Mickey Hart. The second drummer.\n\nBut maybe that shouldn't be the case. Maybe drummers should get their due. Maybe that one solo should be given a higher priority. Maybe they can move to the front of the stage. Maybe, once in a while, they can even... sing?\n\nOr, you know, not. Let's face it, if they were that talented, they probably wouldn't be drummers in the first place...",
