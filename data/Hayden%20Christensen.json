The chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen? Hayden Christensen's haircut? Hayden Christensen's whining? Hayden Christensen himself?\n\n(Don't worry, dear readers. Hayden Christensen is not Jewish, grandmother by the name of Rose Schwartz be damned. His solitary I point comes from partially Jewish spouse, Rachel Bilson.)\n\nAnakin slaughtering children? Watto, the possible Jewish stereotype? Jake Lloyd, the worst kid actor ever? Midichlorians? \n\nAlright, fine, it's Jar-Jar Binks.",
