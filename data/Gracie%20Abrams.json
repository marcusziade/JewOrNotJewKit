  "description": "The phrase \"nepo baby\" has literally entered the dictionary. As of this year, Miriam-Wesbter defines it as \"a person who gains success or opportunities through familial connections\". It mostly applies when there is a perception that success would not be possible otherwise.\n\nSo now you know what is a nepo baby, who is a nepo baby? Oh, too many to mention; the prime example might be Apple Martin, the daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. Apple was once called the \"cutest celebrity baby\". Now she is a \"media personality, model, singer-songwriter, and socialite\". Yep, that's a \"nepo baby\".\n\nAt some point, some (but definitely not all) nepo babies cease being nepo babies, which happens when they break away from paternal ties and show that they can stand on their own. Ben Stiller is a prime example. Heck, even Gwyneth herself, the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and producer Bruce Paltrow. (Good luck catching up to mom, Apple.)\n\nWhich brings us to Gracie Abrams, who used to open for Taylor Swift and is now Grammy-nominated all on her own. Her recent song, \"That's So True\", rose to #6 in the US and topped charts in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Her father is uber-filmmaker J.J. Abrams.\n\nBut Gracie claims she is not a nepo baby! You see, she works very hard, and she kept her parents out of \"anything careerwise\". But, come on, everyone knows who her father is. It's right there in her name.\n\nThis profile's verdict is in her name as well!",
