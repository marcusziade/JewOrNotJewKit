  "description": "It's tough enough to figure out who's Jewish and who isn't without having to research people who are Jewish and don't even know it, themselves. That's the story Madeleine Albright tells, anyway, and it would take a lot more research than we're willing to do to dispute it.\n\nApparently Ms. Albright's family was Jewish back in the '30s and converted to Roman Catholic to keep themselves safe from the Nazis. This kind of chicanery rarely fooled the SS, who probably would have rounded up anyone scoring over a three on this website, just to be sure. But it's obvious they did a pretty good job, since not only is Madeleine alive today, but even SHE was fooled. \n\nSo how do you score that one? After all, she's definitely Jewish. But she's also lived her life as someone who's definitely NOT Jewish. Ordinarily we'd round it up to the nearest whole Jew. However it's important to point out that she hasn't exactly embraced her rediscovered heritage. No happy challahs here, just a fairly reluctant light rye.\n\nIt's fair to say we're starting to feel a little snubbed. If the situation were reversed, we'd certainly step up to the pulpit and have a little glazed ham. Maybe we'd even change the name of this site to CatholicOrNotCatholic.com.\n\nWell, we probably wouldn't go THAT far...",
