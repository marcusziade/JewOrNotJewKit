  "description": "We don't claim to be experts on fashion; far, far from it. But there is one thing we know for sure:\n\nAnimal print. Ew.\n\nIt seems to be a staple among Jewish women of all ages, doesn't it? To deck yourself in something resembling a dead leopard, zebra, or tiger. Or monkey? There are monkey animal prints?! Why?\n\nSo here we have Rachel Zoe, TV hostess, stylist to the biggest of the stars. Probably America's best-known fashion expert right now (hey, we have heard of her!). And yes, Jewish, real last name Rosenzweig. What does she peddle?\n\nAnimal print. Ew.\n\nWho knows... Maybe this is cyclical. Maybe animal print will go the way of shoulder pads, jumpsuits, and rhinestones. Or maybe we shouldn't be talking about a subject we clearly don't know much about.\n\nBut seriously...\n\nAnimal print. Ew.",
