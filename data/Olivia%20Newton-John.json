  "description": "How would you connect such completely different people as Nobel Prize winning physicist Max Born and \"Grease\" star Olivia Newton-John? Quite simple, really.\n\nBorn, who was born (oh, the puns!) Jewish in Germany, but converted to Lutheranism, won the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his research in quantum mechanics.\n\nOne of Born's assistants was Edward Teller, who later became the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\", and also a Jew, as previously discussed.\n\nIn 1979, after the Three Mile Island incident, Teller visited an anti-nuclear power rally, and suffered a heart attack after trying to \"refute some of that propaganda\". He blamed Jane Fonda, one of the speakers at the rally, for cardiac arrest.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Fonda became a fitness guru, stirring the exercise video craze. At the same time, Olivia Newton-John (her mother was ethnically Jewish) released an exercise-theme song and video telling everyone to \"Let's Get Physical\". Headbands galore.\n\nSo there you have it, Born to Teller to Fonda to Newton-John, in three easy steps.\n\nOr we could have just mentioned that Born was Newton-John's grandfather. But where is the fun in that?",
