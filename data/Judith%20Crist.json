  "description": "Rejoice, goyim! Today, on Cristmas, we're finally profiling the Jewish Crist. No, not the Jewish Christ, silly! Spelling is important.\n\nThis Jewish Crist went by the name of Judith. She was a long-time film critic, a pioneering woman in the field, working for New York Magazine, the Today Show, and TV Guide. (She hated such supposed classics as \"Cleopatra\" and \"Some Like It Hot\"!) And, just like the Jewish Christ, she came from a family of Jewish parents, in her case Helen Schoenberg and Solomon Klein. (In his case, Mary and Joseph, no last names given.)\n\nSo what made Judith a Crist figure? It was her marriage to a presumably goyishe man named William B. Crist. We would have stuck with Klein, but that's us. Judith decided that a Crist can be a Jew.\n\nAnd, honestly, that name change got her this Cristmas profile. Commence the rejoicing!",
