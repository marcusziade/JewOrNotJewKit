  "description": "So there's a new television series about Russian spies. It's about a married couple that is completely ingrained in American society â€” no one knows who they truly are! The show is called \"Allegiance\"...\n\nWait a freaking minute! Isn't there already a show about Russian spies, a married couple that is pretending to be American? Isn't it called \"The Americans\"? Haven't we been watching it for the past three years? Yes, we have!\n\nSo what gives? \"The Americans\" is damn great, if you get past Keri Russell's terrible accent when she tries talking in her supposed mother tongue. Why the hell do we need a second show on pretty much the same subject matter? (Yes, there are differences, like the time period, the age of the children, but... come on!)\n\nOne thing \"Allegiance\" has on \"The Americans\"? Jews. Margarita Levieva, who came to the US at a young age in the wave of Russian Jewish immigration, plays the daughter. (At least her accent has to be better than Russell's.) We assume Scott Cohen (he's the lead) is Jewish as well, but we're too lazy to look him up. Heck, it turns out the show is Jewish at its core: it's based on an Israeli series, \"The Gordin Cell\"...\n\nEven with all that, we're not watching. We're sticking with \"The Americans\"... We've learned to live with Keri Russell's accent.",
