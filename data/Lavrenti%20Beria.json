  "description": "So close to our first triple-Gibson. So close.\n\nUnfortunately, when searching the web for Jewish material, one often runs into cleverly disguised Neo-Nazi sites, who conveniently claim every conceivable sociopath was a Jew. One of their favorite targets is Stalin's sidekick Lavrenti Beria, the head of the NKVD (later known as KGB), and a complete psychopath.\n\nDon't believe those websites; Beria's only connection to Jews is the number he killed. And we can go into detail and list all his crimes, but we don't have the time or the patience. If you are curious, the internet is at your fingertips. Look it up.\n\nSo why the rumor-mongering? Apparently, Beria \"was often described as looking like a Jew\". So there is your 1 for the O Score.\n\nSo close to our first triple-Gibson. So close.",
