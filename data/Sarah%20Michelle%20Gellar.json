  "description": "What's in a middle name? How often do you mention yours? If you are like us, that middle name stays neatly tucked in in the back of our mind, only appearing on special occasions. We're Jews, after all. No Anne Maries, Bobby Jos, or Mary Janes here.\n\nTake a random Jew... Let's say Steve Guttenberg. An obviously Jewish name. But what if the cover of your \"Short Circuit\" DVD said \"Steven Robert Guttenberg\"? You'd start to wonder, right? \"Steven Robert\"... Sounds a bit goyishe. Same goes for Benjamin Edward Stiller, Adam Richard Sandler, and many others.\n\nThose many others include Sarah Michelle Gellar, whose middle name had us fooled. Take it away, and you're left with Sarah Gellar. Talk about a heeb! But add that Michelle, and our shiksa alarm starts going off.\n\nSeriously, what Jews use their middle names?",
