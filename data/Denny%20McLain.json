  "description": "Denny McLain tells a story about his Jewish mother who wouldn't let him sign with the Yankees because the team's representative had dirty shoes.\nSo he signed with the White Sox instead and spent most of his career with Detroit.\n\nDenny McLain is angry with the Tigers now because they didn't invite him back for the anniversary of their World Series win in 1968, which was also the same year he became the last pitcher to win 30 or more games in a season.\n\nDenny McLain seems to have forgotten that in 1970 he was suspended from baseball for three months because of his gambling. And that later reports suggested that in 1967 a broken foot that cost him six starts had been caused by organized crime members looking for payment on gambling debts. And that his post-baseball career has been marred by further involvement with the mob and multiple arrests including imprisonment for drug trafficking and racketeering.\n\nDenny McLain is an idiot. And a liar.",
