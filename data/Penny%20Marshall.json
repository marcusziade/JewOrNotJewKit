  "description": "If you have Peacock (there is no good reason to have Peacock, but bear with us), the one thing that this cripple of a streaming service has is access to all seasons of Saturday Night Live. So if you do (perhaps you got a Black Friday deal or something), open SNL, Season 14, Episode 1, and scroll to 25:30. There it is!\n\n\nThere were many influences for JONJ. This was clearly one of them: the effervescent Tom Hanks, fresh off his success in \"Big\", presiding over \"the game that all Americans love to play\"!\n\nThe goyishe husband-and-wife pairs of Kevin Nealon and Victoria Jackson face off against Phil Hartman (RIP) and Jan Hooks (RIP) in a gripping affair. (The confidence with which Nealon says \"He is a Jew!\" when presented with a picture of Ed Koch is rather chilling.)\n\nWe're not gonna spoil the rest, but let's talk about the sketch's first question: Penny Marshall, who directed Hanks in \"Big\". Penny Marshall! Not a Jew, right? Seems pretty obvious to us, and yet... Perhaps it was her marriage to Rob Reiner? \"Schlemiel, schlimazel\" on \"Laverne and Shirley\"?\n\nIn any case, it's a pretty short sketch, but definitely worth checking out if you like our website and you have Peacock. (One out of two for most you, we bet!) And if you want to play our own version of \"Jew, Not a Jew\", we have one in the... Tom Hanks profile!",
