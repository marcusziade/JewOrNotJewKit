  "description": "Matt Bevin, the idiot Governor of Kentucky...\n\nDo we really have to resort to name calling? Can't we just stay apolitical and explain if the man is Jewish? Matt Bevin, the Governor of Kentucky...\n\nNo, no, no. He blamed a 7-year-old girl's shooting for her being home from school due to a teacher's strike. Yes, seriously. He also said \"guns are not the problem\", leading to conclude that \"video games [are]\". Yes, really!\n\nSo, Matt Bevin, the idiot Governor of Kentucky, a Tea Party favorite, a Christian fundamentalist, and, for those who don't like \"idiot\", according to a recent poll, the least popular governor in the United States... was born to a Jewish mother.\n\nWhere did it go wrong?",
