  "description": "Sometimes when we get bored at work and we've run out of things to read about, we end up at Sporcle.com â€” home of egregiously invasive advertising and moderately made trivia games. For those of us who are MLB-inclined, nothing beats taking a baseball quiz on a slow, early spring day.\n\nAnd thus, we end up searching our brains for, say, the players who have hit 300 or more home runs in their career. The first few are obvious. Bonds, Aaron, Ruth, Mays, Griffey... Then there are the ones that are more obscure, but who we remember for whatever reason like Dale Murphy or Rocky Colavito. \n\nBut there's a few that we always forget about (we may have taken this quiz a few times over the years) and one of those blind spots is Ralph Kiner.\n\nWe don't know why we never think of Kiner. He had a perfectly acceptable career and was a last ballot, last vote, Hall of Fame inductee. Maybe it's because we mostly remember him as the mostly befuddled announcer for the Mets who once referred to Hall of Fame catcher and team star Gary Carter as Gary Cooper. \n\nMaybe it's the fact that he spent the majority of his career in Pittsburgh. Or that, while good, he was never a superstar. Maybe we just have a blind spot for players who played in the early 1950s. Who's to say?\n\nKiner isn't even our most egregious omission. We also have a habit of forgetting the far more Jewish (Kiner's only a quarter) Shawn Green.\n\nYikes!",
