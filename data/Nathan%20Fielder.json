  "description": "Dear Nathan for You,\n\nBig fans of your show. Funniest thing on TV. Which got us thinking:\n\nYou help small businesses with your creative ideas. Well, we're not exactly a business here (the next dollar we make will be our first), but we are a small website! Sure, we get more traffic that we ever dreamed of, but we're finally coming to the realization that that big break might not come. We will not be showering in gold shekels. We will not be shaking hands with dignitaries. You get our drift.\n\nSo, help us, Nathan for You! Here's an idea: We always note a large spike in traffic when a possibly Jewish celebrity dies. Now, we're not advocating killing someone, but perhaps... Well, you're better at this than us. We'll let that marinate with you.\n\nOr maybe we just need a redesign.\n\nYours in awkwardness,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
