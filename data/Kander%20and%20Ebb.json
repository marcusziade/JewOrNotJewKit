  "description": "Earlier this year, a tweet went viral. (Alright, tweets go viral all the time. Look what we stooped down to, when our buffoon of a president is using Twitter as his preferred means of communication... But this is not about that. Well, it's sort of about that...)\n\nAnyway, it all started when a neo-Nazi tweeted a YouTube clip from \"Cabaret\". Now, neo-Nazis don't usually make their love of musical theater known, but this clip made sense to the idiot: Nazi youths, singing \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\".\n\nThat was not the tweet that went viral; its follow-up did. In it, Missouri politician Jason Kander (he came close to winning a Senate seat last year) pointed out that the song was written by his uncle. His JEWISH uncle. His GAY JEWISH uncle.\n\nThat would be John Kander, who, collaborating with Fred Ebb (also Jewish, but not gay), created such musical fare as \"Cabaret\", \"Chicago\", and \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\". They also wrote the famous \"New York, New York\" song that became that city's unofficial anthem.\n\nWe're not sure if the neo-Nazi replied, nor do we really care. Clearly, subtleties of life are lost on a large percentage of the tweeting populace. (Speaking about that buffoon...)",
