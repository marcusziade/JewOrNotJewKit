  "description": "Larry Charles co-wrote some of the darkest episodes in \"Seinfeld\" history, including the one with the Nazis and the one Elaine buys a gun. (You haven't seen that one? That's because it was deemed too disturbing to film.)\n\nCharles then went on to write for \"Mad About You\" and executive produce \"The Tick\" and \"Dilbert\".\n\nFrom there, he was reunited with Larry David, and directed numerous \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episodes, including, once again, some of the darkest ones.\n\nAnd when Sacha Baron Cohen needed someone behind the camera to direct his exploits as Borat, Bruno, and now the Dictator, here was Charles again.\n\nSo why is he not better known?\n\nOn second thought... considering the beard and how dark his work is, maybe that's for the better?",
