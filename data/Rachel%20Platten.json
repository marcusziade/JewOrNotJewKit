  "description": "Who is the most popular Jewish female singer/musician RIGHT NOW?\n\nYour answer is probably Barbra Streisand. Well, guess what, Babs is not gonna be here forever. Sad, but true.\n\nBette Midler? Same deal. These once-shining stars, while still popular with the elderly crowd, are on their last legs. So what Jewish women are there to replace them?\n\nPerhaps Rachel Platten can fill the void? Her \"Fight Song\" jumped up the charts last year. It was a bonafide hit, and Rachel seems destined for greater things. And, yes, clearly one of us: Jewish parents, raised Jewish, married a Jew. Most importantly, she is clearly not geriatric.\n\nWho is the most popular Jewish male singer/musician RIGHT NOW?\n\nDrake. Duh.",
