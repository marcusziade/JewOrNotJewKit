Now imagine an informed discussion of Chabon's works that points out his ongoing obsession with homosexuality. \n\nThat more than just having gay major characters in most of his works (\"Mysteries of Pittsburgh\", \"Wonder Boys\", \"The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\", \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union\"), most of his narratives turn on the discovery of those urges and the truths that are revealed by accepting them.\n\nAnd then — the big d'enoument — Surprise! He's happily married with four kids. \n\nSee, now that's an interesting profile! But sadly, GONG does not exist and we are left with saying only that Chabon is an excellent writer, an excellent voice for our people, and that we hope he continues to produce exciting, entertaining, thought-provoking work into the future.\n\nBlah blah blah blah blah.",
