  "description": "In the 2016 Olympics, Or Sasson (great name!) of Israel was drawn against Islam El Shehaby of Egypt in the first round in judo. Sasson won, and approached El Shehaby for a handshake. The Egyptian shunned him.\n\nFuck El Shehaby. There, we said it. We understand that Israel and Egypt don't get along, but this is petty. One of the points of the Olympics is for different countries to come together, regardless of their differences. Sasson was clearly a bigger man. El Shehaby was clearly an antisemitic coward.\n\nWell, Sasson ended up winning more matches. He got a bronze medal, only Israel's ninth Olympic medal of all time. El Shehaby? Who cares.\n\nSeriously, fuck that guy.",
