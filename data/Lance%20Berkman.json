  "description": "Here's an odd one.\n\nApparently, some people out there think Houston Astros' superstar Lance Berkman might be Jewish. Not to give away the big surprise or anything, but he's not. Mistaken Judaism happens all the time, of course, and usually it's pretty clear why.\n\nNot this time.\n\nIs the name Berkman Jewish-sounding? Even if it were, isn't the whole theory out the window with a name like Lance? After all, even the world's best bagel is verboten once you throw a huge hunk of bacon on it.\n\nHe's over six feet tall, weighs over 220 pounds, grew up in rural Texas, loves ballroom dancing, and is nicknamed Fat Elvis. How is this man even remotely Jewish? \n \nNeed we go on? The only reason to assume Lance Berkman is Jewish is that he's awesome and since Judaism is awesome, too, they simply belong together.\n\nIt's a stretch, but hey, it makes about as much sense as the idea that Lance Berkman is Jewish in the first place.",
