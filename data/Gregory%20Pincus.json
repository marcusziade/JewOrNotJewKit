  "description": "So many questions about Dr. Gregory Pincus, the inventor of the contraception pill...\n\nHow did he come up with the idea?\n\nIt's hard to imagine he was sitting around, twiddling his thumbs, and thought, \"I gotta invent a pill that stops conception!\" Was he always interested in the subject? Did he come from a large family where he had to fight for every morsel of food? Or maybe it was fueled by something else? Perhaps a youthful indiscretion?\n\nHow did he get women to participate in testing it?\n\nYou would think that testing the pill on rabbits or monkeys would not be enough. So he would have to round up women to agree to test this new, potentially dangerous, G-d knows what it will do to your body, product. What woman would agree to that? And then, would there be a control group? And how would a woman feel when she found out she was  given a placebo instead? And how many iterations did he go through before coming up with the final product?\n\nWell, at least one question doesn't need answering:",
