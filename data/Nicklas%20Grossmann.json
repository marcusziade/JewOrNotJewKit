  "description": "Nicklas Grossmann, who played a decade in the NHL, spent almost his entire professional career living with a mistake. A small, pesky mistake, but a mistake nonetheless.\n\nYou see, when he was young, his name was misspelled. He was too shy to correct it, and the mistake propagated. For years, as he played in the Swedish league, in the NHL and for the Swedish national team: \"Grossman\". One n.\n\nDid you know what that pesky missing n did? Got Grossmann listed on a bunch of Jewish hockey player lists! After all, it doesn't get more Jewish than \"Grossman\"!\n\nWell, Nicklas Grossmann was never really a \"Grossman\", and he isn't Jewish. Damn that pesky n!",
