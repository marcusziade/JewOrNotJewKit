  "description": "We get a lot of letters in our mailbox, and this one might be the most disturbing ever. (Errr... well, not exactly. Let's say it's the most disturbing ever that did NOT come from an antisemite. Moving on.)\n\nA reader from Las Vegas writes, \"I woke up at 4 AM in a cold sweat wondering if Carrie Brownstein from the show Portlandia is Jewish. Haven't been able to sleep correctly since.\"\n\nWell, dear reader, all you had to do was fire up Jew or Not Jew (it's available at 4 AM), and... What? No?\n\nWe haven't profile Carrie Brownstein yet? 14 years of this website, and no Carrie?\n\nWe apologize, dear Las Vegan! If only we had profiled Brownstein, you would have been able to sleep correctly. (Perhaps it's time to invest in a better mattress?) Instead, you had to write in, and we had to pick out your letter, and then you had to wait for the profile to appear, twisting and turning, night after night...\n\nCarrie Brownstein is Jewish. Sleep well, dear reader.",
