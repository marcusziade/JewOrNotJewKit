  "description": "It's that time of the year: Oscar time! Or, as we call it, time to find well-hidden Jews among Oscar nominees. Yeah, it's a mouthful.\n\nSomehow, the director category has recently been a breeding ground for these not-easily-spotted Jews. We're not talking about the Woodys, Spielbergs, Coens, and Aronofskys. We're talking about Michel Hazanavicius, winner in 2011, or three-time nominee, David O. Russell.\n\nTake the last three years: 2014, Foxcatcher's Bennett Miller: potentially Irish? No, Jew. 2015, Room's Lenny Abrahamson: Irish-born Jew. 2016, Manchester by the Sea's Kenneth Lonergan: sounds Irish again... Half Irish American, but also Jewish!\n\nPerhaps we should rename it: time to find well-hidden Irish Jews among Oscar directing nominees...\n\nNow THAT'S a mouthful.",
