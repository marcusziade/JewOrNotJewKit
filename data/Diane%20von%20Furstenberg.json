  "description": "We at JONJ take our fashion seriously. No, really, we do! So let's get it correct: Diane von Furstenberg did NOT invent the wrap dress. The design has been around since at least the 1930s, but von Furstenberg did popularize it in the 1970s.\n\nWe at JONJ take our royalty seriously. No, really, we do! So let's get it correct: Diane von Furstenberg is NOT a princess. She used to be one when she was married to Prince Egon of Furstenberg, but lost her title after the divorce.\n\nWe at JONJ take our Jews seriously. No, really, we do! So let's get it correct: Diane von Furstenberg was originally Diane Halfin, daughter of a Holocaust survivor.\n\n(Alright, we were kidding. We don't take fashion or royalty seriously. But it would make for a much shorter profile...)",
