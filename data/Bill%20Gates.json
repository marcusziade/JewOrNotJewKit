  "description": "Fine, readers. FINE. Enough already. We will profile Bill Gates.\n\nAnd here are some of the reasons we should profile him, according to you, our readers (everything sic):\n\n\"I've read somewhere that he is jewish\"\n\"he's rich\"\n\"wealthiest person in the world\"\n\"I thought he was a jew, it is somewhat a general belief\"\n\"His mother is a jew\"\n\"He is my idol\"\n\"VERY RICH!\"\n\"He's Jewish, duh\"\n\nWell, duh, indeed. Other than the reader who wants us to profile his idol... really? REALLY? Oh, come on, dear readers!\n\nSo let's see. One prevailing theory is RICH = JEWISH. Oh, how we wish it to be true! Sadly, that is not always the case. Yes, dear readers, there are some MANY rich people who are NOT Jewish. That might sound hard to believe, but it's true.\n\nFor Bill Gates is NOT Jewish. His lineage is a mix of English, German, and Scotch-Irish, with no discernible Jewishness anywhere on the family tree, going back to the 1700s. He's William Henry Gates III, for crying out loud, named after his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather! His mother is a pure WASP! His sister's name is Kristi! He... Oh, enough already. He is not a Jew!\n\nThere you have it, readers. You got your wish. Now please stop asking us to profile Barack Obama.",
