  "description": "Allow us to peek outside this screen. You're reading this on a computer. We're right, aren't we?\n\nNo, not a computer? A tablet? A phone? Unless you printed this out to take to the bathroom with you... in that case, go ahead, finish up, we'll wait.\n\nAll done? Where were we... Computers, tablets, phones. You know what they all have in common? Well, duh, many things. But let's add a few items to the list.\n\nPrinters, faxes, TVs, DVD players, microwaves, watches, washing machines, alarm systems, pacemakers... Pretty much anything electronic. They all have a microprocessor (or multiple) inside!\n\nAnd who invented that little thing that makes the modern world go round? Well, a few people: Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor (Jew!).\n\nAnd if you are reading this on a toilet... We're willing to bet that in a few years, it will be fit with a microprocessor as well.\n\nThanks, Stanley and friends!",
