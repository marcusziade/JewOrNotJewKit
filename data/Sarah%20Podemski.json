  "description": "\"Reservation Dogs\" is a pretty strange show. It seamlessly transitions from teenage hijinks to pre-Columbian mythology to aliens. (Wait, did we just describe \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\"? That clearly wasn't our intention.)\n\nThe show takes place in an indigenous community, and is created, written, directed, and acted by Native Americans. (The one exception is co-creator Taika Waititi, who, as we profiled years ago, is indigenous, just not American.)\n\nBelieve it or not, there are three Jews in this Native American cast. The most prominent is Sarah Podemski, who plays Rita, Bear's mom. Podemski was born in Canada to a Jewish father and a First Nations mother, and was raised Jewish.\n\nThe other Jewish actors? Jennifer Podemski, who plays Willie Jack's mom, and Tamara Podemski, who plays Elora's aunt. (They are sisters in real life, of course!)\n\nIn any case, despite its continuous change in tone and subject, most of \"Reservation Dogs\" works incredibly well. (We can't say that about \"Crystal Skull\"!)",
