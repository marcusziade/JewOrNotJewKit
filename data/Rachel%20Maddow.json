  "description": "Why do people think that television host and pundit Rachel Maddow might be Jewish?\n\nWell, she is quite liberal, and Jewish women tend to be pretty liberal.\n\nShe is quite intelligent, and Jewish women tend to be pretty intelligent.\n\nShe is quite lesbian, and Jewish women... ummm...\n\nSo, clearly, we can see why some might think that Rachel is a Jew. And some would be partly right: she does have a Jewish grandfather. But the rest of the family isn't, and Rachel was raised in a staunch Catholic household.\n\nAnd here's another thing that separates her from Jewish women; she is quite tall, an inch under six feet.\n\nCome on, people, not every liberal, intelligent TV personality is Jewish. Though it sure seems that way sometimes, doesn't it?",
