Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, my parents want me to become a doctor. But all I want to do is dance, dance, dance! How do I go about changing their mind? â€” Noah Schwartz, 16, Cleveland, Ohio\n\nDear Noah,\n\nHmmmm. You got us here. How do we sell your parents on your career choice? Well, for starters, calculate the total cost of college and medical school, and make sure to adjust for inflation. Present your parents with all the breakdowns, show the final figure, and see if they still think medicine is the right occupation for you.\n\nThat might work, but we have an inkling that your parents might make a point that there never have been any Jewish dancers. So bring up Fred Astaire. We bet your parents had no idea that quite possibly the greatest dancer ever was Jewish!\n\nNow, your parents might visit our website and find out that Astaire was only half Jewish, and, depending how you count, even less than that, since his Jewish grandparents converted. Not much we'd be able to do then. Sorry.\n\nHope you enjoy a career in podiatry,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
