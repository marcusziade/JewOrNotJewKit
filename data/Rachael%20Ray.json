  "description": "Dear Bill Maher,\n\nYou like to raise controversy. We get it. Every now and then you say some things that get people up in arms. Now, it's our turn.\n\nNo, you didn't say anything antisemitic, far from it. Instead, you paraded a list of Jewish celebrities that were supposed to convince goyim to vote for Bernie Sanders. Ha ha.\n\nHere's our problem: even though the list seemed like impecable research (Natalie Portman, Gene Simmons, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr, etc, etc), you led it off with... Rachael Ray?\n\nPerhaps a part of it is our fault. We're sure your crack staff ended up on our website when researching Jews, but we didn't have a profile of Rachael. We didn't think we had to. She seems like such an obvious goy! And now, readers are bombarding us with requests to confirm that she is Jewish because of your claim. She is not!\n\nNext time, don't hesitate to contact us, and we'll help you out. Heck, here's a hidden Jew to lead off your next list:\n\nYourself.",
