He won the US championship eight times, spanning 1936 and 1969, and, if not for Soviet collusion, probably would have challenged for the world title. A one-time child prodigy...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, we just love this photograph! This is Reshevsky, at the age of eight, beating multiple Frenchmen simultaneously. Let's examine it closer:\n\n\n\n\n\np = document.getElementById(\"photo\");\nd = document.getElementById(\"desc\");\nb = document.getElementById(\"but\");\nh = document.getElementById(\"hl\");\nvar t = new Array(\n\"Let's start in the obvious place: this guy. What fantastic facial hair! And that look into his eyes: ''I am losing to an eight-year-old!''\",\n\"This guy has the Chaplin hat...\",\n\"And this guy has the Chaplin mustache. Don't see much of those nowadays.\",\n\"They actually let a woman in! So progressive.\",\n\"And here is a girl, admiring young Reshevsky. Who knows, maybe the little grandmaster was her first love...\",\n\"We can't really tell, but it looks like Reshevsky is actually losing on this board. His white pieces look outnumbered, with black penetrating.\",\n\"Now, this guy clearly lost. Tough luck, anonymous Frenchman! At least your defeat is enshrined for generations.\",\n\"That sailor outfit is a tad passe, but nice shorts/stocking combo!\",\n\"Another terrific mustache! This concludes our presentation.\"\n);\nvar cx = new Array(90, 5, 150, 93, 60, 70, 210, 215, 160);\nvar cy = new Array(70, 12, 14, 10, 58, 180, 46, 192, 50);\nx = 0;\nb.disabled = false;\nfunction showNext() {\n d.innerHTML = t[x];\n h.style.left = cx[x];\n h.style.top = cy[x];\n h.style.display = 'inline';\n x++;\n if (x \u003e= 9) b.disabled = true;\n}",
