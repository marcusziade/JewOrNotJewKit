  "description": "We've heard of Jews changing their names to sound less Jewish. But what about the goyim?\n\nGlenn Gould. Renowned pianist. Not a Jew. Parents, Russell and Emma, were Scottish/English Presbyterians.\n\nSo what did Gould change his name to?\n\nWell, it were his parents who changed it TO \"Gould\". From... \"Gold\". To avoid being mistaken as Jewish.\n\nUmmm... OK? How does that help, really? Isn't \"Gould\" just a variant of \"Gold\" anyway? In fact, Glenn was still mistaken for for Jewish â€” after the name change.\n\nSeriously, Glenn's parents. There are so many less Jewy options you could have gone with. Even if you wanted to keep the \"Go\" as part of your last name. What about \"Goy\"? Russell, Emma, and Glenn Goy? Has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?\n\nAnd you'd never get mistaken for Jewish, we guarantee that.",
