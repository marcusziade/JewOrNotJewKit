  "description": "In the mid-1990s, Debra Winger, a three-time Oscar nominee, stopped acting. She disappeared from Hollywood. There's even a documentary about it, \"Searching for Debra Winger\".\n\nIn that film, Winger and other actresses discuss how difficult it is for women to stay on top of the acting game, how hard it is to juggle work and family, how a male-dominated society pigeonholes female actors... All valid points. But here's something to remember about Winger:\n\nShe is notoriously difficult to work with. \"An Officer and a Gentleman\", which put her on the map, sizzles from her romancing Richard Gere; the two actually despised each other. Winger called Gere \"a brick wall\", said she hating making the movie, and openly feuded with the director. In fact, director feuds have been a pattern on pretty much everything she's worked on. And it wasn't just men that Winger was antagonistic towards: on the set of \"Terms of Endearment\", she allegedly farted in Shirley MacLaine's face.\n\nSo, while it is true that women don't always get the fare shake in Hollywood... Perhaps in the case of Winger, they do?",
