  "description": "Isn't it strange that there is a Jewish woman named Jamaica?\n\n(The woman in question is renowned author and Harvard professor Jamaica Kincaid.)\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't be. Ever since the Europeans came to the New World, Jews have been trickling to the Caribbean, be it to escape persecution or enjoy the sunny beaches. While the Jewish population of various Caribbean islands was never large, it was substantial. A recent study estimated that some half a million of Jamaicans are of Jewish descent. That's a sixth of the island's population.\n\n(It's not clear if Kincaid is descendant from those Caribbean Jews. She converted to Judaism after marriage. In fact, she isn't Jamaican at all; she is from Antigua.)\n\nIsn't it strange that there is an Antiguan woman named Jamaica?\n\nA little?",
