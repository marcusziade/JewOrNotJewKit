  "description": "We loved \"The Hunger Games\", so why haven't we written a related profile yet?\n\nWell, there are no Jews in the books. There is no religion at all, it seems like. And no echoes of Jewish ethnicity in any of the characters; we won't even pretend otherwise.\n\nHowever, there are a few Jews in the movie. Elizabeth Banks and Lenny Kravitz, for one. But they already have been profiled...\n\nThere's also director Gary Ross. Not exactly a big name, but he has a couple of Oscar nominations, including one for writing \"Big\". And yes, he is Jewish. But if we were to nitpick...\n\nWell, we really enjoyed the movie. But there were two things we didn't particularly like: the casting of Gale and his perfectly-coiffed haircut... and Ross's direction. Specifically the rampaging shaky cam. And yes, you get used to it, but it's distracting. Not that it ruins the movie or anything. We liked the movie! We're nitpicking!\n\nSo now we're anxiously waiting for the sequel, \"Catching Fire\"... Except Ross won't be involved. He dropped out after asking for too much money. Oh well. Less shaky cam, one can hope.\n\nBut also less Jews...",
