  "description": "Are we really doing this? Mr. Poopybutthole?\n\nOn a season two episode of \"Rick and Morty\", the family is overrun by parasites that implant in memories. Not only do the parasites appear real, they make it seem that they have always been there, sharing history with the host.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Rick gets rid of all parasites, leaving only Mr. Poopybutthole. Then, the reveal (spoiler alert!): Mr. Poopybutthole is real. Mind blown!\n\nIn further episodes, Mr. Poopybutthole returns in little bits. Then, in a special short, he is seen looking through a scrapbook, when... Well, here it is.\n\nSo, let's review the possibilities: 1. Mr. Poopybutthole is Jewish. 2. Mrs. Poopybutthole is Jewish. 3...\n\nWhat if Mr. Poopybutthole's scrapbook memories are just a parasite that infected HIM? Mind blown, right?\n\nAfter careful consideration, we'll go with Jew. After all, he never removes that hat...\n\nfunction loadPic() {\n swapPic('m/mr__poopybutthole','poopy');\n}",
