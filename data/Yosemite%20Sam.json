  "description": "\"Oooooo! I hate that rabbit!\" â€” Yosemite Sam\n\nYou better sit down for this one. Yosemite Sam is one of us. (Yo-Semite?) \n\nYes, Yosemite Sam, the red-mustached, screaming, gun-toting, bipolar, rabbit-hating maniac is a Jew. His real name, as revealed on a recent episode of \"The Looney Tunes Show\" is... Samuel Rosenbaum.\n\nWe know, we know! A name like Rosenbaum doesn't have to be Jewish. It could be goyishe German! A red-mustached, screaming, gun-toting, bipolar, rabbit-hating, maniac German! That sounds about right... No one who acts and looks like Yosemite could ever be Jewish!\n\nSam's looks were modeled after Warner Bros animator and director Friz Freleng, real name: Isadore Freleng. Jew.\n\nOooooo! I hate that verdict!",
