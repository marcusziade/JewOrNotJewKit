  "description": "The argument of the greatest movie trilogy of all time has no end. In fact, here at JONJ Headquarters we've beaten it to death ad nauseam.\n\nThe usual candidates are: Godfather, Star Wars (the originals, duh), Indiana Jones (the first three, duh), Back to the Future, Karate Kid, and Lord of the Rings.\n\nAnd since we're not gonna settle the greatest trilogy argument, so let's figure out what the Jewiest trilogy is.\n\nGodfather: James Caan, Jewish characters (Moe Greene, Hyman Roth)... \n\nStar Wars: Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Frank Oz, Watto...\n\nIndiana Jones: Ford (again!), Steven Spielberg, Kate Capshaw...\n\nBack to the Future: Spielberg (again!), Michael J. Fox (not Jewish, but raises his kids as such), Einstein the sheepdog...\n\nLord of the Rings: Ummmmm... ummmmm... we got nothing. Unless you want to count the Dwarves or Hobbits as Jewish, as some suggest, but we'd rather not. No, the closest thing those movies have to a Jew is Sean Astin, who discovered that his biological father was Michael Tell, publisher of  The Las Vegas Israelite newspaper.\n\nSo your answer is... unresolved between Star Wars and Indiana Jones.\n\nJust like in our greatest discussion.",
