  "description": "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.\n\nJews are known to pray next to a wall, not to sit on one. Besides, every Jewish mother would tell their child that sitting on the wall would be dangerous, it could only lead to...\n\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.\n\nTHAT. See, if Humpty was Jewish and listened to his mother like all good Jewish children, he'd never gotten himself into this predicament. Speaking of which, who is Humpty's mother? A chicken? A duck? A goose makes a lot of sense...\n\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nCouldn't put Humpty together again.\n\nThe poem was written in England in 1810. Not exactly Jew Heaven. Napoleon is rising in Europe. It's highly, highly unlikely that the entire army of a nation came to aid a Jew. Possible? Maybe, if he was an important Jew, but no Jew held a high post in England at the time... Disraeli himself had to convert in order to rise to prominence.\n\nNow, is there something that we know about Humpty, not mentioned in the poem, that can be interpreted as Jewish? He is a philosopher, and we Jews do tend to overanalyze... Hmmm. Maybe his belt or cravat is really a tallis, and that's why no one can be sure what it is? We're reaching here.\n\nAnd at the end, it all just comes down to:\n\nHe's an egg. He's edible.",
