  "description": "Scully enters the basement of the FBI building in Washington DC. Fox Mulder reclines behind his desk, feet up. He is holding a small top in his left hand, examining it.\n\nScully: Mulder, I came as soon as I got your message. What's going on?\n\nMulder: I think I may have discovered another secret page from my family history, Scully.\n\nScully: What is it? Your father was involved in an alien cover-up? Your mother was possessed by demons? Your uncle was a bigfoot?\n\nMulder: No Scully, something far more unexpected. I think I may be Jewish.\n\nScully: What? Mulder, that doesn't make any sense. Your mother's maiden name is Dutch. When we thought you were dead, you were buried in a Protestant ceremony. You even took me to church once.\n\nMulder: I know I just... I feel this voice inside me... it's like, if we were just performers in a play, the person playing me is telling me I'm Jewish. Does that even make sense?\n\nScully: Mulder...\n\nMulder: Take a look at this. It's called a dreidel. I've been spinning it all day. But there's something odd about it.\n\nMulder spins the top on his desk. It rolls and then topples onto the wood\n\nMulder: See, Scully, gimel again. I think it's trying to tell me something.\n\nScully: Oh, it's telling me something all right...",
