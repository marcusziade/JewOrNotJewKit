  "description": "We've been patiently waiting for Ozzy Wiesblatt to make his NHL debut, which he finally has, a member of the Nashville Predators. Could Ozzy's brothers follow suit?\n\nThe siblings, in order of age:\nOcean\nOrca\nOzzy\nOasiz\nOceania\n\nAlas, Ocean and Orca looked to have topped out at minor league level, and Oceania is a girl with no interest in hockey. There is still hope for Oasiz... But it's unlikely that they will upstage the Hughes dynasty as that elite Jewish NHL family.\n\nThere is more to the Wiesblatts than supposedly-clever names; they are children of deaf parents. Ozzy says his first language is American Sign Language. A pretty remarkable family, even if not all of them can reach top hockey glory... but what would they have done if they had a sixth child?\n\nOracle?\nOmelette?\nOnomatopoeia?",
