  "description": "We watched the new adaptation of John le Carre's \"The Little Drummer Girl\", and kept wondering: why, in Hollywood, are Israeli spies always played by... goyim?\n\nTake some recent works: in the one mentioned above, the two main Israeli agents are played by Michael Shannon (goy) and Alexander Skarsgard (goy). \"The Debt\", which is actually a remake of an Israeli movie: Helen Mirren (goy) and Ciaran Hinds (goy). (Or, if you take their younger versions: Jessica Chastain (goy) and Sam Worthington (goy).) The much-maligned \"Munich\": Eric Bana (goy) and Daniel Craig (goy). Heck, even if we go back to the original \"Little Drummer Girl\" adaptation, starring a horribly miscast Diane Keaton: Klaus Kinski (goy) and Yorgo Voyagis (who? goy).\n\nBefore anyone complains: Oscar Isaac, who we have as \"Barely a Jew\" had the main role in \"Operation Finale\", and, no, we didn't forget \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\", starring the one and only Adam Sandler, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nYou can do better, Hollywood! You need Israeli spies? Two words for you: Gal. Gadot.",
