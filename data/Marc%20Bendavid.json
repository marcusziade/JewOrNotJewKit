  "description": "We were watching SyFy's fairly OK series Dark Matter the other day, and one of the characters referred to Marc Bendavid's character as a \"pretty boy.\"\n\nAnd we thought, \"Really? Pretty boy?\"\n\nWe're not saying Marc (Canadian, Jewish on his father's side) is unattractive. Everyone on TV is attractive, really. Even the ugly people are far better looking than most of us mortals. \n\nAnd Marc's a good looking guy, we suppose. If we were into guys. Which we're not. So our opinion shouldn't matter all that much, right? If we say we don't like Indian food, you don't ask what we think of Saffron Palace.\n\nBut here's the thing, if you look at the male actors on that show? Marc is probably the least attractive of the four main characters. In our eyes, anyway.\n\nRegardless, we're watching a show that takes place in the future. On a space ship capable of faster than light travel. Where none of the characters remembers who they are and call each other by number and one of them is an android and another survived getting shot out an airlock.\n\nAnd the moment that broke our suspension of disbelief was one character referring to the Marc Bendavid character as a \"pretty boy.\"\n\nSo, yeah, that probably says a lot more about our own weirdness than anything about the actor. Don't you think?",
