  "description": "FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, is incredibly corrupt. Bribes are the norm. (How do you think Qatar, a country with no soccer infrastructure and insane summer heat, was selected to host the World Cup?) Everyone knew that; it was just never proven.\n\nEnter Chuck Blazer, who held a number of high posts in the US Soccer Federation, the regional CONCACAF, and in FIFA itself. Blazer blew the whistle, exposing his cohorts. It led to an international raid, with numerous FIFA executives arrested, and a whole-scale change at top of the organization. (It's still incredibly corrupt, but somewhat less so. Small steps.)\n\nThe crimes now came into the limelight. For example, one FIFA executive used money earmarked for soccer to pad his own pockets. He had not one, but two rent-free apartments in Trump Tower (shrug). One of the apartments was for... his cats. He funneled over a million into a timeshare in the Bahamas. He stole money to pay for his parking, his caterers, his housekeeper, his phone, his car insurance (for a Hummer that he also got for free...)\n\nThat executive?\n\nChuck Blazer.",
