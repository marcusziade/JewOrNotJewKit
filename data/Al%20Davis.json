  "description": "We wrote once before that we'd be more than happy to have some good scary supervillains here at JONJ.\n\nNot the real ones, mind you. Actual nut jobs and crazies are no fun at all. But the representations of cartoonish supervillainy we all know and love. Those guys rule. Unfortunately, there's slim pickings.\n\nWe've got Magneto. He's pretty cool.\n\nBut then, Darth Vader? Lex Luthor? Lord Voldemort? No, no, and no.\n\nSo we're more than happy to welcome Al Davis, ringleader of the evil Oakland Raiders. \n\nThe tormentor of football fans from Oakland to Los Angeles. If there's a player known for bad behavior, Davis collects him for his criminal football gang. Then they band together to promote evil in the NFL and put fear in the hearts of lovers of good football everywhere.\n\nWhat? He's not fictional? That's impossible!",
