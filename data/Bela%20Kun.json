  "description": "History is written by the winners.\n\nIn 1919, during the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic, its leader Bela Kun would probably top the list of greatest Hungarians ever.\n\nSoon the republic fell, and Hungary reverted to a kingdom. Kun was sent into exile, and his exploits stopped being lauded.\n\nIn 1949, the communists took over to create the People's Republic of Hungary. Kun was back to being a hero... not that he cared. He spent his exile in the Soviet Union, until 1938, when Stalin decided to get rid of him. But back in Hungary? Back to being on top. (In textbooks, at least. Clearly, your average Hungarian was not a fan of the communist rule.)\n\nOf course, since 1989, communist Hungary is no more, and once again Kun's star has fallen. That whole Red Terror he commanded certainly put a damper on things.\n\nSo, unless the communists somehow get back to power (which seems rather doubtful), no list of greatest Hungarians for Kun.\n\nGreatest Hungarian Jews?",
