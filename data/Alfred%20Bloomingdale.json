Fine, the murder! Bloomingdale was dating one Vicky Morgan; when the affair started, he was 54, she was (allegedly) 18. When the affair ended, she was dead, but not before suing him for palimony. Was he involved in the murder? We'll leave speculation to the tabloids.\n\nNow the credit cards: In the late 1940s, Bloomingdale had a lot of ritzy friends. Those friends didn't always have cash on hand, so he came up with the idea of \"Dine and Sign\", which eventually became Diners Club, the first credit card.\n\nFinally, the department store, and the reason he is on our website. Yes, the Bloomingdales were Jewish; \"were\" being the key word here. Store founder Lyman Bloomingdale definitely was, but Alfred, his grandson, converted to Catholicism upon marrying his wife. (The one he cheated on with the dominatrix/prostitute.)\n\nAnd that's enough about Alfred Bloomingdale...",
