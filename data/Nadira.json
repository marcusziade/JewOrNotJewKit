  "description": "Farhat Ezekiel was born in 1932 to a Jewish family in Baghdad. (Yes, in 1932, there were Jewish families in Baghdad.)\n\nMy red muslin scarf is blowing in the wind, yes, may it happen\nWind is blowing, my heart is trembling\nMy scarf is flying, revealing my face\n\nWe're sorry... Where the hell did that singing come from? My red muslin scarf? We don't even own a red scarf. Anyway... Nadira, as she became to be known, moved to India, and in 1952, got a start in Bollywood, playing a savage princess in the movie \"Aan\". Her next big role\n\nYour body is like sandalwood,\nYour naughty glances, your soft smile,\nPeople should not blame me if I become crazy\n\nOh boy. We apologize. We don't really know what's going on. It looks like attempting to write about a Bollywood actress (can you believe it, a JEWISH Bollywood actress!) somehow spontaneously breaks us into song. Absurd, we know! Comparing a body to sandalwood? Not something we would do on our own, trust us\n\nMy dream is a beautiful face\nSight of her makes one ecstatic\nI will do this glorious deed\nAnd make my name in the world of heart\n\nStop it, stop it, STOP IT!",
