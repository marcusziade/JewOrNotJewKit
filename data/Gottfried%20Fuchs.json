  "description": "Sometimes, we like to go the obscure route on JONJ. Today is one of these days.\n\nWho is Gottfried Fuchs, you ask? A German soccer player. So what's a German soccer player doing on this website?\n\nWell, for one, Fuchs was Jewish, and to profile a Jewish German athlete is an obscure rarity in itself. Understandably, Fuchs left Germany because of the Holocaust and settled in Canada. But there's more to Fuchs than that.\n\nAs you probably know, soccer is a pretty low-scoring game. A hat-trick, or three goals by a single player in a match, is pretty rare. Here in New Jersey, we still remember fondly the night in 2000 when Clint Mathis scored five. Well, Gottfried scored more than five.\n\nYou see, Gottfried is one of only three people in the history of soccer to score TEN goals in an international match. He did it against Russia at the 1912 Olympics. If you are curious, the other two were Denmark's Sophus Nielsen, who put ten past France in 1908, and Australia's Archie Thompson, who scored 13 against American Samoa in 2001. Of course, neither of those two is Jewish.\n\nBut Fuchs was. Even if he is so... obscure.",
