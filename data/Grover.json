Why?\",\n\"Now, we're here to determine if Grover is actually Jewish, or just celebrates Hanukkah so that Sesame Street can be inclusive... you know, like the Winnie-the-Pooh and the Hanukkah Dreidel, or Porky the Pig's Purim.\",\n\"This woman is Jewish. I think this pretty much settles it. Does Grover have a dad? How would this impact his I Score?\",\n\"Now, Elmo is clearly goyishe. We sure hope Grover can teach him and Abby the true meaning of Hanukkah! (Not the true story, which better goes unsaid: Massacre. Lots and lots of massacre.)\",\n\"That's a wig, right?
