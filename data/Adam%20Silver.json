  "description": "When NBA commissioner David Stern announced last year that he will retire after 30 years in office, we were a little concerned. No, not because it's hard to imagine someone doing a better job than Stern (we honestly could care less), but because it would mean that one fewer league has a Jewish commissioner.\n\nYou see, as previously discussed, four of the five major American team sports (yes, we're including Major League Soccer) has a Jewish commissioner (the lone holdover is the NFL). What are we to do with Stern dropping out?\n\nWe didn't have to be concerned for too long. Together with his retirement, Stern announced his successor: his deputy commissioner, Adam Silver. So, even with Stern now gone, we're back to four Jews running sport leagues.\n\nWhat? Bud Selig is retiring this year? Did he hand-pick a Jewish successor yet? No? Should we be concerned?\n\nPerhaps not; even if the new baseball commissioner is not a Jew, it's hard to imagine someone doing a worse job than Selig...",
