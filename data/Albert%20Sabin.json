  "description": "Polio sure sucks, doesn't it? Thank G-d for Jonas Salk, Jew, for ridding the world of it, right?\n\nRight! But not completely correct...\n\nDon't get us wrong, we love Dr. Salk at JONJ. He's got the perfect score and everything. But he should not be the only one getting credit for getting rid of polio.\n\nSalk invented the injected vaccine, which he started trialing in 1952 and announced in 1955. Two years later, an oral vaccine was invented by Albert Sabin; it was actually easier to administer than Salk's. Together, the two vaccines swept the world, making polio a thing of the past. So, as much as we love Dr. Salk, Dr. Sabin needs to get his share of the credit...\n\nPolio sure sucks, doesn't it? Thank G-d for two Jews for ridding the world of it, right!",
