  "description": "We're not saying that Jews invented punk rock, but...\n\nWhat are the two greatest punk bands in history? If you said The Ramones and The Clash, then you're agreeing with Rolling Stone's assessment. And who made up the Ramones and the Clash?\n\nTwo of the Ramones (Joey and Tommy) were clearly Jewish. So were three of the Clash's five founding members: Keith Levene, previously-profiled Mick Jones, as well as frontman Joe Strummer. (Born John Mellor, in Turkey, of all places, his Jewishness came from a great-grandmother.)\n\nSo whether you hear London Calling or are trying to Rock the Casbah, causing a White Riot or going Straight to Hell...\n\nJews might not have invented punk rock, but they did perfect it.",
