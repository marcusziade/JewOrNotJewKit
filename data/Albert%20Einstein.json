  "description": "You can have Leonardo da Vinci. We won't argue about Isaac Newton. Thomas Edison can take a hike. Archimedes, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates are all too ancient to be considered. Copernicus? Galileo? Descartes? No thanks. We have Albert Einstein... the smartest man who ever lived.\n\nThe word \"genius\" gets thrown around so much today. That football coach is a genius! That movie director is a genius! Anyone who has an IQ over some number is a genius! The word's meaning is ever so diluted. But we're not here to argue about semantics, we're here to argue if someone is Jewish or not.\n\nAlbert Einstein: Genius. Jew.\n\nBut why such a high score for someone who was non-observant? All the proof you need is in Einstein's own quote, \"A Jew who sheds his faith along the way, or who even picks up a different one, is still a Jew.\" Besides, anyone whose work was attempted to be discredited by the Nazis as \"Jewish physics\", anyone who was offered the presidency of Israel without being its citizen, anyone who has become a prototype for that overused word \"genius\", is clearly deserving of the perfect score.\n\nAlbert Einstein: Smartest Man Ever. Jew.",
