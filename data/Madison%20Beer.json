  "description": "Why would a Jew wear a cross?\n\nBefore we get to the possible answers, let's explain Madison Beer. Half of you, dear readers, probably have no idea who she is. The other half is asking, why did it take us so long to profile her?\n\nMadison Beer is what is known as an \"internet personality\". She was \"discovered\" by Justin Bieber. She sings, we think? Has a popular Instagram channel. Used to date David Beckham's kid. Had a bat mitzvah and everything. Wears a cross. Huh?\n\nOption 1: Converted to Christianity. That's the most logical answer. Not ideal, but what can you do. Win some, lose some. Enjoy your Jesus, loser!\n\nOption 2: As a fashion statement. Yeah, we don't get it either. We're far from being fashion experts, obviously, but a cross? Why not a nice Magen David? Much more stylish!\n\nOption 3: Stupidity.\n\nWe don't have the answer, folks.",
