  "description": "When the best Mel Brooks movies get cited, \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" rarely makes the top of the list, which is a darn shame. \"Because, unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent!\" You tell them, Cary Elwes!\n\nElwes, of course, is Robin Hood, facing off against the rather Jewy Prince John (Richard Lewis, RIP, in all his Hebrew glory: \"trefe!\") Brooks appears himself as friar rabbi Tuckman. And then there is Tracey Ullman, as the witch Latrine, part of perhaps our favorite exchange from the film:\n\nJohn: Such an unusual name, \"Latrine\". How did your family come by it?\nLatrine: We changed it in the 9th century.\nJohn: You mean you changed it TO \"Latrine\"?\nLatrine: Yeah. Used to be \"Shithouse\".\nJohn: It's a good change. That's a good change!\n\n\nHave to agree with the prince there... Seriously, if you haven't seen it in a while, give it a whirl. It's a rather excellent late-period Brooks.\n\nOh, and Tracey Ullman changed her name in real life as well. No, not from anything Jewy, as she is goyishe. It used to be Trace!\n\nThat's a good change?",
