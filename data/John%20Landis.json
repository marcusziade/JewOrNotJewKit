In front, we all know the discussion begins and ends with Steve Guttenberg.)\n\nAnd then... Oh boy. We beg you not to look what Landis has turned out since. Two words: \"The Stupids\".

It's that.\n\nSo what happened in 1990?\n\nSylvester Stallone wanted to do a comedy. The result was Landis-directed \"Oscar\", starring Sly as the titular mobster in a 30s-set slapstick farce. It's been all downhill since.\n\nAt least he didn't stick around for Stallone's \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\"...",
