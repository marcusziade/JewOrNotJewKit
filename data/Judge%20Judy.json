  "description": "There's a whole host of TV judges wandering the airwaves nowadays, but there are only two in our hearts: Judge Wapner of the People's Court and Judge Judy of... Judge Judy. Anyway, which one's better? Cage match! But since we don't have a cage on hand, we'll put them in this handy-dandy chart, instead:\n\n\nWapnerJudy\nHome BaseCaliforniaNew York\nVerdict: Judy. Both shows are filmed in California, but Judy is a former NYC judge, and that gives her the advantage.\nHairRecededDisheveled\nVerdict: Judy. A bad haircut is better than no hair at all. Trust us.\nYoung LoveFuture screen star Lana TurnerFuture prosecutor Ronald Levy\nVerdict: Wapner. Because when normal people get to date future starlets, everyone wins.\nBook\"From the Bench\"\"Beauty Fades, Dumb is Forever\"\nVerdict: Push. Because when judges write, everyone loses.\nParodyThe Devil goes to the People's Court on SNLTurned into \"Judge Harm\" on the Simpsons\nVerdict: Wapner. Jon Lovitz in a red devil suit with floppy ears gets us every time.\nMudslingCalled Judy coarse and insultingCalled Wapner rude for pointing out that she is coarse and insulting",
