  "description": "In a previous profile, we wrote that football player for Green Bay Packers, lineman Charles \"Buckets\" Goldenberg, \"was probably the only Jew to be nicknamed 'Buckets'\". Probably!\n\nGoldenberg played in the 1930s. We need to fast forward 40 NFL years to get to Steve Furness, who won four Super Bowls with the 1970s Pittsburgh Steelers. His nickname, as bestowed by Hall of Fame teammate \"Mean\" Joe Greene...\n\nBuckethead.\n\nNo, \"Buckethead\" is not exactly \"Buckets\", but it turns out we were right along, even ignoring the semantics. Even though it was reported that Furness converted to Judaism for his wife, apparently he never completed the process.\n\nWhat a Buckethead!",
