  "description": "You know what always confuses us? Some countries have a president, other countries have a prime minister... and some countries have both. Sometimes, the president is the one with the actual power, sometimes it's the PM (and the president is a figurehead), sometimes... it's both?\n\nIt's all very complicated. Take the Czech Republic, for instance. The president is elected, and then appoints the prime minister. The former is the head of state; the latter is the head of government and is pretty much in charge... but the president does share some of the power, so he is not exactly a figurehead.\n\nThis brings us to Jan Fischer, who became Czech Republic's PM in 2009. Fischer is Jewish; his father was a Holocaust survivor. He only stayed in power for a year, as a change in parliament forced him to resign. So Fischer had no place to go but... try to become president! Alas, even though he was considered a popular PM, that wasn't enough to get him elected to the highest office of the land. (Or second highest? We're still confused.)\n\nAren't you glad OUR country's government is not as perplexing? On second thought...",
