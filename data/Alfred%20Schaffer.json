  "description": "The world of sport hold special reverence for players who spent their entire career with one team. Joe DiMaggio. Larry Bird. John Elway. Martin Brodeur. Mario Lemieux.\n\nIn soccer, with thousands of clubs all over the world, such continuity is rare, and that made Alfred Schaffer so special. No, he didn't play his entire career with one team. He played for 21.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1925, Schaffer turned out for clubs in his native Hungary, as well as Germany, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and even the US (the old school, soccer(!) New York Giants). For decades, those 21 clubs were a world record.\n\nSchaffer was more than just a journeyman: he won championships in three countries. He also turned out for the Hungarian national team, scoring an amazing 17 goals in just 15 games. After retiring as a player, Schaffer became a coach and added Romania and Italy to his international roster. He even co-coached Hungary to the second place finish at the 1938 World Cup.\n\nSo, maybe, special reverence should be held for players who played for over 20 teams. Especially if they are Jewish!",
