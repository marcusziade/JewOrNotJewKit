  "description": "In the Norman Schwarzkopf profile, we mentioned that there are not that many famous Jewish generals.\n\nIn the Rupert Murdoch profile, we mentioned that there are not that many prominent Australian Jews.\n\nSo one would assume that it would be impossible to find a prominent famous Australian Jewish general.\n\nYet here we are.\n\nJohn Monash, whose parents were Prussian immigrants to Australia, was a brilliant military tactician, who fought for the Allies during World War I. What's more, he was the first person to be knighted on the battlefield in over 300 years.\n\nThat'll teach us to make broad statements.\n\nMaybe that elusive Eskimo Jew will finally be found?",
