First of all, O'Brian(?) was an actor who was quite active in the 1950s-70s. He is best know for playing the title character on something called \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", which lasted 229 episodes.\n\nAnyway, O'Brian(?)'s birth name was Krampe, but it once got misspelled as \"Krape\", and really didn't like that. He tried to change it to \"O'Brien\", which he claims was his mother's family name...\n\nOnly it wasn't? O'Brian(?)'s mother was Edith Marks, the daughter of Leo Marks and Mary Luker. So we're really not sure where he is getting \"O'Brien\" from. Perhaps he should have changed it to \"Marks\", which, as far as Jewish names go, is pretty hard to misspell?\n\nIt beats the hell out of Krape Krampe, that's for sure.",
