  "description": "Would you like to move to the town of Cabot Cove? It's a sleepy little hamlet on the coast of Maine. Population, 3560.\n\nOne small problem with it, sadly. Over the span of 12 years, there were 274 murders in Cabot Cove, making it the homicide capital of the world... if it was real, that is.\n\nThankfully, Cabot Cove is entirely fictional. It's the setting of \"Murder, She Wrote\", the old television show that starred Angela Lansbury as writer Jessica Fletcher, solving a murder week after week. In fact, it gave name to a narrative trope: \"Cabot Cove Syndrome\", or recurrence of death in secluded, supposedly serene settings.\n\n\"Murder, She Wrote\" was co-created by a trio: Peter Fischer (goy), as well as the tag team of Richard Levinson (Jew) and William Link (half). That duo was responsible for numerous mystery shows, including \"Columbo\", and a bunch of made-for-TV movies, most of them with \"murder\" in the title.\n\nEven today, after all these years, there are multiple \"Murder, She Wrote\" tours that can take one on an excursion to supposed Cabot Cove.\n\nJust don't move there!",
