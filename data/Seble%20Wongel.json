  "description": "Ethiopia had a long Jewish tradition, dating back to ancient times. There are very few Jews left in the country, as most have made their way to Israel. Heck, we've even profiled a few of them (mostly soccer players, because that's how we roll).\n\nBut all the way back in the 16th century, Ethiopia actually had a Jewish empress!\n\nSeble Wongel was the wife of Lebla Dengel, AKA Dawit II. Unlike those that came before and after him, Lebla stood out: he only had one wife. Must have really loved that Seble!\n\nSeble reigned for over two decades, and two of her sons became emperors in their own right. The Solomonic Dynasty that she contributed to lasted all the way until 1974, when Haile Selassie became the last Ethiopian emperor...\n\nWait? SOLOMONIC Dynasty? Named after THAT Solomon? Told you, Ethiopia had a long Jewish tradition!\n\nEmphasis on \"had\".",
