  "description": "Quick, name a movie that came out this century that starred Elizabeth Hurley! Here's the answer: you can't. (And if you can, hi, Miss Hurley! Please drop us a note, we'd love to chat for... reasons.)\n\nAnd yet, for a brief time in the late 1990s, Hurley went from the woman who shagged Hugh Grant to the brink of superstardom, the crest of another potential British invasion... (Which fizzled out, leaving us with The Spice Girls, Oasis, and, of course, Hugh Grant.)\n\nFirst there was \"Austin Powers\" (Which, can you believe it, is 28 years old! Austin was frozen in 1967 and defrosted in 1997.). Then there was the hottest Satan ever (apologies to Al Pacino) in \"Bedazzled\" (2000 is still the last century for you pedants.) Then... an abyss of absolute nothingness. She is now doing straight-to-TV Christmas movies. So not Jewish, if you are wondering what she is doing on our website.\n\nBut her son is part Jewish! Model/actor/nepo baby Damian Hurley is a product of a tryst between Elizabeth and Jewish businessman Steve Bing. So maybe that's what Hurley was doing the past two decades... being an attentive mother.\n\nYou know what we just realized? In two years, it will be prime time for Myers to bring Austin Powers back for another sequel, for better or worse. (Probably worse.) Miss Hurley will definitely be available!",
