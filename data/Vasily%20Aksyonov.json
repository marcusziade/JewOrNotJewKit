  "description": "Why did so many of the most creative Russian authors...\n\nVladimir Nabokov, who made words into his personal playground, started out in Russia, but, as the Soviet Union came to form, ended up in America.\n\nJoseph Brodsky, whose poetry danced on the page, started out in the Soviet Union, but ended up in America.\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn, whose harsh prose reflected his harsh life, started out in the Soviet Union, but ended up in America.\n\nSergei Dovlatov, who hid linguistic brilliance underneath supposed simplicity, started out in the Soviet Union, but ended up in America.\n\nVasily Aksyonov, whose stylish prose rebelled against the norm, started out in the Soviet Union, but ended up in America.\n\nWe think we know why.",
