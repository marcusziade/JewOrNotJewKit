  "description": "Who is Elena Ferrante?\n\nNo, seriously, who is Elena Ferrante? Nobody knows.\n\nThe Italian woman(?) is a best-selling author, known for her(?) Neapolitan Quartet, four bildungsroman books that have sold over 10 million copies all over the world. HBO has been adapting them into television series as \"My Brilliant Friend\". Ferrante just might be one of the most popular writers in the world today. Whoever she(?) is.\n\nThe most popular theory is that Ferrante is Anita Raja, mostly known for her work as a translator. Raja is the child of an Italian father and a Jewish mother, who left Germany prior to World War II. Another theory is that Ferrante is Domenico Starnone, who actually won the Strega Prize, Italy's most prestigious literary award, in 2001. He is... Raja's husband. Ferrante, however, has denied that she(?) is a man.\n\nSo, how do we handle this? This seems about right...\n\nsetSubhead('\u003cbr\u003e');\nfunction flip() {\n remember();\n setVerdict(\"Jew(?)\");\n setPeriod(false);\n}\nfunction flip1() {\n memorize();\n setImage('anita_raja');\n setSubhead('1953 -');\n setRatings(3, 3, 4);\n setVerdict('Jew');\n setTitle('Anita Raja');\n setPeriod(true);\n}\nfunction flip2() {\n memorize();\n setImage('domenico_starnone');\n setSubhead('1943 -');\n setRatings(1, 0, 4);\n setVerdict('Not a Jew');\n setTitle('Domenico Starone');\n setPeriod(true);\n}\nfunction setPeriod(t) {\n per = document.getElementById(\"verdictPeriod\");\n per.innerHTML = t ? \".\" : \"\";\n}",
