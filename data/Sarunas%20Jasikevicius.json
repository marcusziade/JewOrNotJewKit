  "description": "In 2006, Israel was marred by a scandal.\n\nOne of its beautiful people, Linor Abargil, Miss World 1998, was marrying a goy.\n\nOf course, a beauty queen wouldn't be marrying just a goy. Linor's fiance was basketball player Sarunas Jasikevicius, who just led powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv to two consecutive EuroLeague titles. On the national level, he was named MVP at the 2003 European championship when Lithuania won the gold, and had an Olympic bronze medal to boot. So, as far as his basketball resume, not too shabby.\n\nBut all the accolades and promises of eternal love were not enough. Israeli organizations called for Linor to drop Sarunas if he failed to convert. He didn't convert.\n\nNevertheless, the wedding was scrupulously studied. Was there a rabbi? Was the food Kosher? Did Sarunas step on a glass? Does the Israeli media have anything better to do?\n\nWell, two years later, the couple divorced. We're not sure if there were any rejoicings and we-told-you-sos, or if the Israelis moved on to the great new scandal:\n\nBerating supermodel Bar Refaeli for dating the goyishe Leonardo DiCaprio.",
