But that's besides the point.\n\nSo, how is it going, Mel? Read any good books lately? Slander any Jews recently? Plan to make ANY MOVIES?\n\nYou know, Mel, I gotta be honest with you. I liked \"Lethal Weapon\". Quite an enjoyable film. You were so believable as a nut job. Now? Everyone knows you're a nut job in real life as well.\n\nSo you want to make another historical picture. But do you have to do one on us Jews? Doesn't your own Christian history have more bleeding corpses that need to be publicized? Or perhaps you should find a Biblical story on the subject of infidelity. Maybe about someone leaving their wife of 30 years and eight children for a younger woman? That's gonna be somewhere in there? Nu?\n\nStay away, Mel. Let me rest in peace. I already have to deal with American Jews turning Hanukkah into a Jewish Christmas. You making a movie about my life? I didn't ask for this, Mel. I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS!\n\nAnd the worst thing?\n\nYour association with me has denied me a perfect Jew Score!",
