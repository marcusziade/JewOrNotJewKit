  "description": "Look at that mustache! What a healthy mustache!\n\nThat mustache stands for midwestern upbringing, family values, apple pie, and God. It stands for the longest serving American governor of all time. It stands for Terry Branstad.\n\nBranstad became Iowa's governor in 1983 and served through 1999. In 2011, he returned to the office. He is coming onto two decades of governing Iowans and their corn. Lots and lots of corn.\n\nThe mustache stands for Brandsad's heritage. His healthy, Norwegian, Lutheran, Jewish heritage. Who else but the Norsemen to bestow such a robust legacy! Wait, did we just say \"Jewish\"?\n\nTurns out Brandstad's mother is a Jew. Don't worry, according to him, having a Jewish mother shows \"his tolerance of diversity\".\n\nThat mustache stands for tolerance of diversity, we guess?",
