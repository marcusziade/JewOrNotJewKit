  "description": "Recently, Forbes has come up with its yearly list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Now, as with all of such lists, the results are pretty absurd. Any \"power\" list that puts Michelle Obama at the top spot ahead of, oh, say, German chancellor Angela Merkel, has to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nGlancing through the list we get to various absurdities such as Lady Gaga at #7 and Sarah Palin at #16. (What's her power? Brainwashing  rednecks? Oh, we kid, we kid. Wait, we don't. No rednecks read our website. So yes, Palin's power is brainwashing rednecks. A good power to have, for sure, but localized to America. Doesn't really belong on the world list. Unless, of course, she becomes President. Shit. Forget we mentioned this. Moving on.)\n\nBut, even with all these absurdities, let's find the top Jewish woman on the list. And we don't have to look far: Kraft Foods CEO Irene Rosenfeld is one spot below the First Lady at #2 (she was #6 last year and is consistently in the top 10). Why does Rosenfeld rank so high? Well, she makes $26 million a year, the second-highest salary for an American woman. And this year, she oversaw Kraft's purchase of Cadbury, helping boost the company's global image.\n\nSo are we gonna argue with Rosenfeld's spot on the list? Of course, we're not. She makes Philadelphia Cream Cheese, for crying out loud! What do you expect us to put on our bagels, butter?\n\nNow that's pretty absurd.",
