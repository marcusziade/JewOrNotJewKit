  "description": "Odds are, you have never heard of Georg Solti.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't say that. We have a very educated audience! Some of you might have very well heard of Georg Solti! What was his field? Oh. Opera. Yeah, odds are, you have never heard of Georg Solti.\n\nAnd yet, you might have recently heard of Georg Solti, for he was in the news a short while ago, despite being dead for a good 25 years. For the longest time, Solti, a Hungarian-born British Jew who ran the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, held the record for most Grammy Awards won: 31. You almost feel bad for other, Grammy-less operatic conductors, who simply had no chance against the Solti machine!\n\nIn any case, at the most recent Grammys, Solti's record was passed. Someone now has 32 awards.\n\nOdds are, you have heard of Beyonce.",
