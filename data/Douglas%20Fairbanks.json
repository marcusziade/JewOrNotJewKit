  "description": "Did you know that the actor who played Robin Hood, Zorro, and d'Artagnan, the so-called \"King of Hollywood\" was Jewish? No, not a crude hybrid of Kevin Costner, Antonio Banderas, and... Chris O'Donnell?*\n\nNo, we're talking about Doulgas Fairbanks, Sr.** Fairbanks was born Douglas Elton Ullman, and his father, Hezekiah*** Ullman, was a Jew.\n\nNow, we're stretching it a bit here, for Hezekiah abandoned his family when Douglas was five, and it's unlikely that his Catholic mother would say kiddush. Still, we like the sound of a Jewish King of Hollywood, so no 120-years-ago indiscretions are going to stop us from claiming Fairbanks as one of our own.****\n\n\n* Seriously, why hasn't there been a quality modern adaptation of \"The Three Musketeers\" yet? On the other hand, seeing how Hollywood butchered \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", that's probably for the best...\n\n** Not to be confused with his son, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.\n\n*** Hezikiah? Have you ever met a Jew named Hezikiah? Then again, what do we know about the naming patterns of 1833?\n\n**** But of course, you figured that out already.",
