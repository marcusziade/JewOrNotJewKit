  "description": "We're proud of being Jews here at JONJ (maybe a little too proud sometimes). You don't write over 500 profiles of Jews because you're kind of, sort of, maybe into being Jewish. \n\nAnd yet, if there's one thing we can't understand (actually, there are lots of things we can't understand, but bear with us) it's someone who isn't Jewish that chooses to be so.\n\nSeriously, who in their right mind looks and says: \"You know what? Thousands of years of prejudice, violence and misery with little end in sight sounds good to me. Sign me up!\" \n\nOh sure, it's a great religion, wonderful culture, good sandwiches, yadda yadda yadda. And we've all been indoctrinated that there's nobility in being the underdog, the shlimazel done good. Heck, plenty of people marry in and we understand how that happens, too. But choosing this kind of inevitable heartbreak of your own accord? On purpose? That's just plain meshuggenah. \n\nSo, do we welcome someone as famous and distinguished as Sammy Davis Jr. with open arms? Every day of the week and twice on shabbos. But do we understand his decision?\n\nNot even a little bit.",
