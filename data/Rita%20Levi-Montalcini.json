  "description": "We get a lot of questions about who we chose to profile here at JONJ Headquarters. Because it's not exactly a meritocracy now, is it?\n\nWe have pages upon pages (upon pages) of bimbos and mimbos (and maybe a few Jimbos? Gotta figure, right?). Meanwhile, absolutely amazing people like Rita Levi-Montalcini are stuck gathering virtual dust.\n\nAnd what, pray tell, did Rita Levi-Montalcini do? Oh, nothing much. \n\nShe just won the Nobel Prize for discovering (along with her colleague Stanley Cohen) Nerve Growth Factor, a key promoter of neurological growth and an important part of several biological processes from inflammation to falling in love. Levi-Montalcini was also named Italian Senator for life (which tells you everything you need to know about Italian government) and became the first ever Nobel laureate to live over 100.\n\nSo yeah, why does she get the shaft while other, so less deserving Jews (and sometimes Not Jews) get profiled first? Maybe it's easier to make fun of a good looking moron than to write something beyond \"she's Jewish, she's great\" about someone like Levi-Montalcini. \n\nMaybe we're just shallow, fame-humping American males with little culture or refinement to speak of.\n\nOr maybe, well, maybe the truth of it is we just live in a society that rewards boobs (in all senses of that word) over brains and we need to get over it.\n\nBut here's the truth: the guinea pig that picks which profiles we write died. \n\nIt's a shame, really. No matter how hard we try we just can't keep the little bastards from flopping over.",
