  "description": "The television industry is known for being self-congratulatory. Heck, they give out awards to award shows! So it only made sense when the Television Hall of Fame was created in 1984.\n\nThe Hall is the list of television titans, the creme de la creme. And that inaugural class of 1984? Those are your Honus Wagners and Babe Ruths.\n\nLucille Ball, America's smiling sweetheart. Milton Berle, the titan, the appendage. Paddy Chayefsky, pioneer screenwriter. Norman Lear, father of the modern sitcom. Edward R. Murrow, voice of the country. And two executives: William S. Paley, who built CBS, and David Sarnoff, the man behind RCA and NBC.\n\nIf you do the math, that's five out of seven Jews! (Everyone but Ball and Murrow.) So it's pretty clear who built television up...\n\nOne sticking point with the Hall of Fame, however. Somehow, Mel Brooks is not in it! We can't even claim antisemitism, not with that inaugural class, and not with the man currently in charge of the Hall... Norman Lear!\n\nYou better take care of that, Norm.",
