  "description": "Back in 2005, two scientists, Katalin Kariko of Hungary and Drew Weissman of the US, published a paper that failed to receive much recognition. Would we have ever profiled Weissman back then, even though he is Jewish? Absolutely not! Why would we profile some little-known scientist?\n\nWell, we're profiling Weissman today, because that 2005 paper helped Kariko and him earn the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine. You see, the subject of the paper was how mRNA reacts with the immune system. You see where this is going, right?\n\nRight. The COVID vaccines developed by Moderna, Phizer, and BioNTech all can be traced back to that research by Kariko and Weissman. Their contribution, one that eventually saved millions of lives, has been finally recognized on the world's stage.\n\nAnother reason we wouldn't have profiled Weissman back then? Jew or Not Jew back didn't exist in 2005! Time sure flies, doesn't it?",
