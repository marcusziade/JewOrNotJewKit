  "description": "We recently found out that Josh Klinghoffer, who spent a decade in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, was the youngest ever inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. (He's since been passed.) And Klinghoffer is Jewish. Cool!\n\nBut once we started doing the math, something didn't add up. We are pretty sure the Red Hot Chili Peppers were active in the 1980s... In fact, they were formed in 1982, and Klinghoffer was born in 1979? He must have been a virtuoso on that Playschool xylophone!\n\nThe answer is obvious, of course. Klinghoffer didn't become a member of the Peppers (is it OK to abbrev it like that?) until 2009, at the age of 30. (So he got into the Hall after just two years?)\n\nKlinghoffer has also performed with Jane's Addiction and Pearl Jam... The former started when he was six, the other when he was 11. It's as if rock bands are the real-life Ship of Theseus thought experiment, with band members standing in for the ever-replenishing planks... Is it still the same band if none of the original members remain? (In case of the Peppers, two originals do remain.)\n\nCool?",
