They hold the greatest gift to man: the Torah.\" — Jon Voight\n\nAnd we are in awe of Jon Voight. He created, no, not the greatest, but a great gift to man — Angelina Jolie.\n\nNo, Voight is not Jewish, although from the looks of things, he might as well be. A long-time host of the Chabad Telethon, he has extensively studied the Torah and Hasidic literature. He counts a number of rabbis as his friends, has addressed the congregation in a Hollywood synagogue on Yom Kippur, and seeks out Chabad centers on his travels.\n\nWhich is much more than many of us real Jews could claim.\n\nWell, Voight has no intention of converting to Judaism. Too bad. That would make Angelina half Jewish, wouldn't it?",
