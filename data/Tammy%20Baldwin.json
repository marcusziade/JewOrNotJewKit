  "description": "As apolitical as we often try to be, we closely watched the last senatorial election in Wisconsin.\n\nSo why do we care about a midwestern state, the top concerns of whose citizens are cheese, milk, sausages, the Packers, and cheese, not necessarily in that order?\n\nYou see, from 1989 on, Wisconsin has had a Jewish senator. In fact, from 1993 to 2011, they had two, with Russ Feingold joining Herb Kohl.\n\nBut Feingold lost his seat, and Kohl decided to retire, leaving Wisconsin's delegation to be taken over by goyim... well, almost.\n\nFor Tammy Baldwin, who did win that last election to take over Kohl's seat, is actually a quarter Jewish â€” she's even related to comedian Andy Samberg. It might not be the heyday of Feingold and Kohl, but it will have to do.\n\nOh, and Baldwin is also the first openly gay senator.\n\nWell, that's pretty important too.",
