  "description": "Geneoligical DNA testing is all the rage nowadays, as Americans of all shapes and colors try to find out if they are part Chinese, Nigerian, or Portuguese (or all of the above?). Other than providing a handy reference to where your ancestors might have come from, there is not much practical use... or is there?\n\nIsrael's figure skaters have already had the most successful Winter Olympics in that nation's history: the team finished 8th, Alexei Bychenko 11th, and Daniel Samohin 13th. Of the seven Israelis, only two (including Samohin) were born there. The others either come from America or from the Soviet diaspora.\n\nBychenko was born in Ukraine and originally competed for that country, before deciding to own his mother's roots and switching to Israel. But think about it: how many athletes are not even aware of their ancestry?\n\nIsraeli Olympic Committee! Pack up those DNA kits and travel to Eastern Europe (and, heck, also America)! Start testing: you don't know how many aspiring Olympians are actually Jewish!\n\nBesides, it would make OUR job that much easier...",
