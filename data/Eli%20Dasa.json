  "description": "Today is a very special day for our website. Today, our website is a man! Cue the music!\n\nHava nagila\nHava nagila\nHava nagila ve-nismeḥa\n\nThat is, if you assume that our website is male. Which we can't really do. So let's just say that today, our website is an adult!\n\nHava neranenah\nHava neranenah\nHava neranenah ve-nismeḥa\n\n13 years? Can you believe it? And today's profile is someone special — someone who would have been 13 himself when our website opened, all the way back in 2006. His name is Eli Dasa, he plays soccer for the Israeli national team, and, yes, he is a landsman — his parents are Ethiopian Jews!\n\nUru, uru aḥim!\nUru aḥim be-lev sameaḥ\n\nSo, celebrate with us as we profile yet another mold-breaker, a black star athlete Jew! (After 13 years, he is not our first!)\n\nUru aḥim, uru aḥim!\nBe-lev sameaḥ...",
