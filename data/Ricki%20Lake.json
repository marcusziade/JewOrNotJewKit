Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I'm just gonna come out and say it — I am fat! F-A-T, fat! And all I want to do is be a TV star! I've tried it all: diets, exercise, bulimia — nothing helps! Should I just give up? — Sarah Koppelman, 18, San Francisco, California\n\nDear Sarah,\n\nGive up? Why? Perhaps you should embrace your... zaftigity? zaftigness? After all, look at Ricki Lake, a fellow Jewish woman who broke into show business in her late teens. She was not exactly svelte, but she embraced her body, and landed a plum movie role. She then had a long, productive career hosting a popular, and only somewhat trashy, talk show. And look at her now, when...\n\nOh. She dropped the weight. Ummmm...\n\nAre you too young for liposuction?\n\nYours in terrible advice,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
