  "description": "Ruth Fischer started out her life as quite a communist. In her early 20s, she co-founded the Communist Party of Austria. She was also one of the early party leaders in Germany.\n\nEven though Fischer was Jewish (her father, Rudolf Eisler, was a prominent philosopher), she wasn't exactly a fan of her people. \"Throw down the Jewish capitalists, hang them from the lamp-post, stamp on them,\" she said in 1923. Again, in line with her communist ideals.\n\nThe German Communist Party had a schism, so Fischer, who at one point ran it, was kicked out. She eventually emigrated out of Germany (good timing there; as much as she might have hated her Jewish roots, Nazis wouldn't really care) and collaborated with another exile, Leon Trotsky. Still fighting for that communist ideal...\n\nLong story short: not only did Fischer end up denouncing communism, it also turned out that she served as an American spy.\n\nBet you didn't see that ending coming!",
