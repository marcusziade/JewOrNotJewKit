  "description": "Today, the New England Patriots are the model franchise if not in all sports, than definitely in football.\n\nOver the past decade, they've been to four Super Bowls, winning three, came on the cusp of a perfect season, and year after year turn out highly competitive teams, all that in the parity-driven NFL.\n\nIt's hard to believe that 20 years ago, the Patriots were a laughing stock. Perennial bottom-feeders, they were constantly on the brink of moving to another city. Even when they miraculously made the Super Bowl, they got destroyed by the Chicago Bears.\n\nSo what happened? Was is the drafting of goy wonder boy Tom Brady? The hiring of misanthropic mastermind Bill Belichik? Or even prior to all of that, giving over the reigns to team-building guru Bill Parcells?\n\nSure, all of those played a part. But none would be possible without the ownership of Robert Kraft.\n\nKraft bought the Patriots in 1994, saved them from moving to St. Louis, hired Parcells, hired Belichik, presided over drafting Brady, built a sparkling new stadium, and turned the Patriots from a laughingstock into one of the most valuable franchises in all of sports.\n\nYes, you guessed it, Jew.\n\n(Editor's update, February 22, 2019: The damn Patriots won a few more Super Bowls... and Kraft got arrested for soliciting. Can't win in everything!)",
