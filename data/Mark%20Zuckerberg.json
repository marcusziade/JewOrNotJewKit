  "description": "Sometimes we feel like the Internet has gone ahead and surfed right past us.\n\nOh sure, we're still in pretty good shape with our big ol' Jewish website and all. But then there's all this other stuff out there that people claim to be enjoying. Stuff that we want nothing to do with.\n\nWe're not videotaping ourselves getting kicked in the nards for YouTube. We don't have a blog. There is no JONJ Podcast coming either. And we're certainly not on Facebook (invented and run by boytschik Mark Zuckerberg and his amazing Harvard friends).\n\nWe could give lots of excuses for this: \n\n\n\nWe're too busy writing hilarious, well reasoned Jew-posts.\n\n\nWe have, y'know, wives, children, lives, football games that are more deserving of our attention.\n\n\nWe just hate people, and a program designed to introduce us to more people sounds like infernal torture.\n\n\n\nThese are all good excuses. But that's all they are. Because we know the truth.\n\nIt's because we're old.",
