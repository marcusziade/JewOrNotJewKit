  "description": "5th century Syria, at the bottom of a pillar...\n\nHey there, Phil!\n\nOh, hey there! You must be the new guy! Marvin, is it?\n\nYep, I'm Marvin! So... how does this work?\n\nIt's an easy job, really. Did you bring a newspaper? You're gonna need a newspaper.\n\nWhat will I need a newspaper for?\n\nTo read, dummy! It gets pretty boring here waiting for the bell to ring.\n\nThis bell?\n\nDo you see any other? When the bell rings, it means he wants something.\n\nWhat does he want?\n\nWhat does a man like that want? Food, mostly. Can't survive on top of a pillar without food.\n\nAnd how do you get him the food?\n\nYou see this bucket? We put the food in the bucket, pull the pulley, and the bucket goes up.\n\nAnd who makes the food?\n\nThe townspeople bring it!\n\nOh, right, mother used to make lamb chops for him... He supposedly likes lamb chops...\n\nDoes he ever! So your mom or whoever brings food, we put in in the bucket, and he eats it.\n\nWhat if no one brings food this day?\n\nHe can go hungry for a day or two, but then he gets pretty irritated. Starts cursing a lot.\n\nA saintly man like that, cursing?\n\nOh, and sometimes he makes requests.\n\nRequests?\n\nLast week, he had a craving for creme brulee.\n\nCreme... what?\n\nYeah, I didn't know either. But I had to run into town and find someone who can make this brulee. Smelled delicious, honestly.\n\nSo that's it? We just sit here all day, and pull up food in a bucket?\n\nPretty much. Well, one more thing.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nWe have to empty the bucket when he sends it down...",
