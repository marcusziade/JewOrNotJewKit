  "description": "What's the scariest movie of all time?\n\nThe Exorcist? Nightmare on Elm Street? Halloween? The Thing?\n\nAll good choices, but no.\n\nThe answer is, Single White Female.\n\nCan you imagine? You invite someone into your home... Someone who seems nice at first, but turns out to be completely mental? Someone who becomes demanding, controlling, possessive? And that's before we get to wearing the same clothes, getting the same haircut... or trying to kill you.\n\nYes... Yes, you can imagine.\n\nBody-possessing demons, dream-invading psychos, homicidal maniacs, shape-shifting aliens, we can handle.\n\nSociopathic roommates?\n\nThat hits a little too close to home, doesn't it?",
