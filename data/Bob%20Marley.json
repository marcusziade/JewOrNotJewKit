  "description": "If you ever go to Jamaica, you will find out about the country's obsession with national icon Bob Marley. His face is plastered everywhere, from flags, to t-shirts, to bongs, to hats. Jamaicans love their Marley.\n\nSo what's he doing on this website?\n\nWell, according to some of Marley's relatives, the Marleys were once Syrian Jews. They started out in the Middle East, made their way to England, and ended up in Jamaica.\n\nSo maybe next time we visit, we'll bring our own Marley flag. Not the one where his face is superimposed on Jamaica's green and gold, but rather on Israel's white and blue.\n\nYeah, sure, we're stretching it. In fact, there is no evidence that Marley had any Jewish ancestry. Yet come to think of it, don't his rastafarian dreadlocks look a lot like peyes?\n\nYa, mon.",
