  "description": "This profile was originally written in 2007. It spoke of our mistake.\n\nFor whatever reason, we assumed that basketball player, Olympic champion, Rebecca Lobo was Jewish. It turns out she wasn't: part Cuban, Polish, German, and Irish. So we lamented our mistake and said that no Jewish woman grows to 6'4\".\n\nTurns out... no mistake was made!\n\nNo, Rebecca is not exactly a Jew. However, recent DNA research has uncovered that she is, in fact, 1/8 Jewish.\n\nSo this profile had to be changed. The verdict had to be changed. The Jew Score had to be changed. We'll keep the ending:\n\nWhat Jewish woman grows to 6'4\"?",
