  "description": "It's springtime (sort of) and we know this because the local supermarket has switched over from chocolates in the shape of hearts to chocolates in the shape of rabbits. Many people look forward to spring â€” the warmer days, the flowers, the promise of regrowth. But for us, there is only one reason to be excited for spring: the annual arrival of the Cadbury Creme Egg.\n\nAmericans only have access to the Cadbury Creme Egg from basically the end of February, when they are rich, chocolatey and delicious, through the middle of April when they are stale, thin, and oddly crunchy.\n\nBut when they're good, they're basically best thing ever. Seeing them at the supermarket, sitting in the aisle with all the Easter candy, is like finding a four leaf clover resting on top of a $100 bill. You just don't get luckier than that.\n\n\nOn the other hand, a trip to the Passover section shows you this. \n\nReligion is not something that you can look at in a marketing sense. To say that we should change the very fabric of our beliefs just to be popular is almost the exact opposite of what faith is supposed to be.\n\nBut there is a world-wide crisis right now amongst Jewish leaders as more and more young landsmen (and landswomen) are assimilating. The modern Jew is more likely to light a Christmas tree than a menorah and many view this as an outright assault on our culture and traditions. They're not wrong.\n\nBut given the choice...\n\nWe like gefilte fish and all, but nobody is choosing frapped carp over a Creme Egg.\n\nfunction loadPic() { fish.style.display='inline'; }",
