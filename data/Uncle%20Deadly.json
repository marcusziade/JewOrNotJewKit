  "description": "Who, you ask haughtily, is Uncle Deadly?\n\nWell, you see, Uncle Deadly is a Muppet. He's a sort of bluish green dragon/lizard/fish thing. You can see him on the left. \n\nIn the 1970s, Uncle Deadly appeared on the original Muppet show as a sort of Phantom of the Opera cipher. He haunted the Muppet theater as a ghost, eventually revealing his secret: he'd been killed by terrible reviews.\n\nThen he disappeared for a while.\n\nThen he was rumored to be getting his own horror/mystery show called Uncle Deadly's House of Badness.\n\nThen he appeared as one of the greedy, evil henchmen in the recent Muppets revival movie. He's one of the money-grubbing bad guys that wants to destroy the Muppet theater to turn it into an oil derrick. Eventually he sees the error of his ways.\n\nSo, yes, Uncle Deadly is the large nosed, money loving, evil, talentless Muppet.\n\nOh, and in a recent clip from the upcoming new Muppet Show, Uncle Deadly admits he's already spent all his TV development earnings on his nephew's bar mitzvah.\n\nBecause of course.",
