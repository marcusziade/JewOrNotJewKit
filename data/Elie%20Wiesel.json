  "description": "The lucky number in Judaism is 18. This is because Hebrew, being ancient and all, uses letters to represent numbers. The letter chai is 18. Chai also means life. Thus 18 is lucky.\n\nTherefore, the lucky JONJ profile is none other than... Bobby Fischer?! Feh. Well it wasn't on purpose we can tell you that much (on the other hand, if you go in order posted — rather than by profile number — lucky number 18 would be Winona Ryder, which is sort of an improvement).\n\nHowever, despite a somewhat useless numbering system (imagine if it was that way in English. What's C + J?), Jews are most certainly a mathematical people, and so multiples of 18 are also found to bring fortune. In fact, these 18 additives are lucky-ER. \n\nSo who makes the list of luckies? Steven Seagal (36), Howard Stern (180), and Korney Chukovsky (900, or 18 x 50) to name just a small smattering.\n\nThe luckiest of all?  That would be today's profile, Elie Wiesel (1350, or 18 x 75)! It's a little ironic of course, considering he hasn't led the most charmed of lives what with the Holocaust and the Madoff scandal and all. But maybe this is just the thing he needs to turn it all around, right?\n\nAt least until he becomes the second luckiest profile in three weeks when we put up #1368...",
