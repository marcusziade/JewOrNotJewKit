  "description": "George: I like sports. I could do something in sports. You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.\n\nAh, the classic Seinfeld episode when the recently-unemployed George dreams of a job in sports. Of course, becoming a general manager is not exactly easy. It's not like they give those jobs to someone off the street.\n\nExcept, sometimes they do. When David Kahn became GM of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves, he did not exactly have the usual background. Yes, he did work in sports... as a sportswriter. (Alright, to be fair, after leaving the newspaper, he did have experience on the business side of things with a couple of teams, but this man was in no way qualified to run an NBA franchise.)\n\nAnd he didn't exactly succeed. During his first draft, the Timberwolves lucked out with three first-round picks... and Kahn drafted three players that played the same position. (Alright, to be fair, he immediately traded one way: the one who is proving to be the best player of the three.) The rest of his tenure in Minnesota was as middling as its beginning.\n\nWhat's that other George quote? Oh, yeah:\n\nKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN!",
