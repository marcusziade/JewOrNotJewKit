  "description": "A Jewish volcano? Alright, a Jewish-named volcano?\n\nWell, yes, a Jewish-named volcano. But first we need to get to Lev Berg, a Russian/Soviet geographer/biologist/historian/ichthyologist/limnologist. (Feel free to look those last two up.) He even had his own evolutionary theory. What, you think Darwin has a monopoly there?\n\nWe'll get to the volcano! Berg actually has many, many things named after him: 60 different species (for example, a fish called the Berg skate (Bathyraja bergi)), a mountain ridge in Antarctica, two capes in the Arctic, a river in Siberia, and, yes, the volcano!\n\nThe Berg Volcano is located in the Kuril Islands, the chain in the Far East that has long been the sticking point between Russia and Japan. It last erupted in 2005, but has been huffing and puffing since.\n\nSeriously, isn't \"Berg\" a perfect name for a volcano?\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('l/lev_berg', 'berg_volcano');\n}",
