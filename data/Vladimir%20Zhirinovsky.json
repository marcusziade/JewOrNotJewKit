  "description": "It really is too bad that we don't give negative scores on this website. This seems like a great place to start, but then, how low can you go? How low would Zhirinovsky's O and K scores be? -5? -20? -1000?\n\nSadly, Vladimir Zhirinovsky's I score is a 3. The antisemitic sociopath who was dangerously close to becoming the President of Russia in the 90s is, as one look at his original last name would hint at, half Jewish.\n\nYet as obvious as that is, he denied it for years, saying that his mother was Russian and his father was... a lawyer.\n\nSo calling him self-loathing Jew is not enough. Self-disgusting. Self-repugnant. Self-abhorrent. And hopefully, soon irrelevant.\n\nBut sadly, half Jewish.",
