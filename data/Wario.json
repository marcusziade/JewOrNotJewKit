  "description": "Even if you're not into video games, you probably know Mario, Nintendo's ever-present mascot. (Full name: Mario Mario. Huh?)\n\nUnless you're into video games, you probably don't know Wario. He's bizarro Mario.\n\nMario is good, Wario is evil. Mario's logo is an M, Wario's is an upside-down M... a W. (Get it? \"W\"ario!) Mario wears red, Wario wears yellow. Mario gets power from mushrooms, Wario from garlic. Mario's mustache is curly, Wario's is edgy. (Clearly, the designers have put in a lot of thought into this.)\n\nMario is Italian, which, if you play the percentages, should make him Catholic.\n\nWhat does that make Wario?\n\nProtestant. Duh.",
