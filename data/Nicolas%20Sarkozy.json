  "description": "At Jew or Not Jew, we know a little bit about sports. And movies. And comic books.\n\nWe can't make the same claim about French politics. But when we are told that the newly-elected, controversial and polarizing President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, is a Jew, we investigate.\n\nAs it turns out, calling him a Jew at this point is a stretch. One of his grandfathers was Jewish, but converted to Catholicism, and Nicolas was raised a Catholic.\n\nLame.\n\nIt's not that we would necessarily support Sarkozy if we were French. It's just that it would be nice to have one of the tribe as the head of one of world's powers (well... former powers). In this case, we'll just have to settle for someone who is just a tad Jewish and move along.\n\nNow, can we go back to discuss the Jewishness of the latest athlete, movie starlet, or superhero?",
