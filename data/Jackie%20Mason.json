  "description": "So, it turns out that Jackie Mason has a vlog.\n\nFor those not up on their web lingo, vlog stands for video blog. And blog is short for web log. And log is short for logbook which was originally shortened from chip log book which refers to... anyway, don't you just love 21st century Newspeak?\n\nIn this case, Mason's vlog is entitled \"the Ultimate Jew\" (so THAT question has been answered). Currently, there are over 200 entries featuring Jackie kibbitzing on just about anything. No, really anything: politics, car commercials, bible prophecies, boxing, Passover Seder... It's enough to make you plotz.\n\nOh, and did we mention that Jackie Mason is 73 years old? That's right, your zadeh is more technologically savvy than you are.\n\nIf you ever needed proof that Jews are an adaptable people, it's staring right back at you now. \n\nCreepy, huh?",
