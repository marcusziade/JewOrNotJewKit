  "description": "Wieners we understand. (No, not THOSE wieners! Get your head out of the gutter!) We might not know what goes in them, but they sure are delicious.\n\nSausages we understand. They are like wieners, but bigger. (Head! Gutter!) In fact, you can say that all wieners are sausages, but not all sausages are wieners.\n\nBut a wiener sausage? That we don't get.\n\nYou see, a wiener sausage is \"a neighborhood of the trace of a Brownian motion up to a time t, given by taking all points within a fixed distance of Brownian motion\". What does that have to do with densely packed meat (Head... gutter...)?\n\nWell, there is obviously no meat involved. Wiener sausage is a mathematical concept named after Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, and, yes, a Jew. It has various applications, including heat conduction...\n\nBut they sure doesn't beat the the taste of a good Kosher wiener in one's mouth. (Head out of gutter! NOW!)",
