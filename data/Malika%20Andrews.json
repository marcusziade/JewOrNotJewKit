  "description": "While we were visiting New Zealand (yes, it's New Zealand again), we woke up very early one morning (time change and all), turned on the TV, and there it was... ESPN. Broadcasting our favorite hockey team from half the world away.\n\nIt was the first time we watched ESPN in something like three years.\n\nESPN used to matter! It was the ubiquitous host for all that is sport. Heck, if you look at our website, in its early days we have a multitude of profiles of ESPN talking heads and anchors. Recently, not so much.\n\nAnd we like sports! We used to like ESPN! But be it the rise of streaming and the cord-cutting that followed, or the concentration of our fandom on few specific areas, or the slow but sure transformation of talking heads into screaming heads, ESPN is just not as relevant anymore.\n\nSo here we have Malika Andrews, who has a Black goyishe father and a Jewish mother, and is the host of NBA Today on ESPN.\n\nWe're not watching it, from New Zealand or from home.",
