  "description": "Remember that Banksy painting that shredded itself? Someone spent $25 million on that... What an idiot! (Perhaps, not an idiot? We have no idea how art works.)\n\nAs original as Banksy is supposed to be, he did not invent the concept of auto-destructive art. Yes, it's an actual genre! It dates all the way back to 1959 and Gustav Metzger, a German-born artist. Metzger was saved from the Nazis by the Refugee Children Movement and settled in England. His work was meant to demonstrate the destruction caused by war... so it destructed itself.\n\nAmong the materials Metzger used were acid and glass. In 2004, he recreated his original anti-destructive creation for the Tate Modern, only for the museum janitor to throw it out, thinking it was trash. (We really have no idea how art works!)\n\nSo, not exactly original, Banksy. Unless... Metzger was Banksy!?",
