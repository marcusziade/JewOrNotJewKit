  "description": "This year, like any other, we awaited Nobel announcements with baited breath. Surely, there will be a Jew to add to our list of greatest minds profiled! Even if we have never heard of them before...\n\nFirst is physiology or medicine, which went to a goyishe Swede. (Damn Nobel home-field advantage!) Then goes physics, always ripe for Jewy candidates... three winners, no Jews. That's fine. We'll get them in chemistry. Three winners again, and not a Jew among them! This is not looking good.\n\nLiterature goes next, and you know the deal: it will be awarded to an author read by a grand total of a dozen readers. This year it's a goyishe French woman. Good for her. Next is peace, and Jews are not winning that one, so let's just move on to our final, and, honestly, best chance: economics.\n\nThere, we have a winner! Among the three laureates is \"for research on banks and financial crises\" is former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke! That's Ben SHALOM Bernanke, if there was ever any doubt. (There wasn't.)\n\nAnd here is the biggest surprise: we've actually heard of him!",
