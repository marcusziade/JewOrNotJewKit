  "description": "You might have guessed from the various profiles on this website that we're not exactly fans of George W. Bush's presidential administration. So even when the voice of that administration was Ari Fleischer, a Jew, we didn't exactly jump on that bandwagon. \n\nIt would take much more than that. Say, honesty. And competence.
