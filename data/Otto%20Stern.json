  "description": "Martin Scorsese won the Best Director Oscar on his sixth try.\n\nIt took Susan Lucci 19 nominations to win an Emmy.\n\nThey got nothing on Otto Stern. The German scientist was nominated for a Nobel 82 (EIGHTY-TWO!) times before finally winning the Physics award in 1943.\n\nThe award wasn't without some controversy; a lot of Stern's work was done together with Walther Gerlach, but his colleague was not given a Nobel. A role was probably played by the fact that while Stern was a Jew who got out before the war, Gerlach stayed put when the Nazis came.\n\nAnother injustice by the Nobel Committee? We're not gonna cry about this one: 1) it's not like Gerlach was Jewish, and 2) 82 nominations! Even Gerlach must have been happy for Stern...",
