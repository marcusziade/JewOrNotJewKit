  "description": "We never gave much thought to why a disco is called a disco. You know, a discotheque. Bunch of Germans in tight leather pants? Come to think of it, we obviously haven't given much thought to a disco(theque), period.\n\nA disco(theque) is called that because the music is played on, well, discs. It wasn't always the case. In 1953, Regine Zylberberg, a Jewish Belgian nightclub singer, became the manager of a Paris club, Whisky a Gogo. She added colored lights and a dance floor. Most importantly, she replaced jukeboxes with turntables, creating the first ever disco(theque). Regine herself worked the records, making her the first ever disco(theque) jockey. You know, a DJ.\n\nFrom Paris, disco(theques) swept through Europe and the rest of the world, eventually giving rise to disco... You know, the music.\n\nNo, we haven't given much thought to disco, period.",
