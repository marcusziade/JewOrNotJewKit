  "description": "There is someone out there named Napoleon Einstein? What the heck were his parents thinking? Alright, your last name is Einstein, fine, but to saddle your child with that combination?\n\nWell, to set it straight, Napoleon Einstein's last name is not Einstein. In fact, he doesn't have a last name.\n\nConfused yet? Let's take it back a step.\n\nNapoleon Einstein is an Indian cricketer, with 111 BFs, a SR of 83.78, and... well, we don't know what these numbers actually mean. They seem large. In any case, he is good enough to represent his country on the youth level.\n\nHis FIRST name is Einstein. He was named after, yes, Albert Einstein. Napoleon is his PATRONYMIC, that is to say, his father's name. So, Napoleon Einstein. (Why not Einstein Napoleon?) There are no last names in that part of the country.\n\nHonestly, considering we live in a country where someone just named their baby Hashtag, who are we to judge? If you're gonna name your child after a person, you can certainly do worse than Einstein!\n\nBut, seriously, why not just call him Albert?",
