  "description": "When we were teenagers, there were two ways to see pictures of semi-naked women: one could hope that a relative received the Victoria's Secret catalog... or one could subscribe to Sports Illustrated.\n\nYes, SI, the venerable magazine, the nation's leader in sport reporting, took a respite for a week every February. On the cover of that issue were not Michael Jordan or Joe Montana. It were Elle MacPhearson or Kathy Ireland. And inside... you should have seen what was on the inside...\n\nOf course, much has changed since then. Today, to see pictures of semi-naked women, all one needs is a quick Google search â€” and it's rather easy to drop the \"semi-\". SI still carries on, but the Swimsuit Issue is no longer as momentous an event as it used to be. Although the current one does feature the lovely and part Jewish Emily Ratajkowski...\n\nWhat's this, you say? We shouldn't take jabs at Sports Illustrated? Doesn't this very site, which spends most of its time celebrating achievement in science, art, literature, and, yes, sport, sometimes take a break to profile a model?\n\nWell... at least we don't picture them semi-naked?",
