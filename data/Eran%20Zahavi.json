  "description": "Can we make the case that Eran Zahavi is the most famous Jew in the world? Yes, Evan Zahavi, someone you, the reader of this website, have probably never heard of prior to today!\n\nWe'll try...\n\nThe point here is that you, the reader of this website, is not exactly the \"average\" representative of the world's population. Heck, 18% of the world comes from China. And the most famous Jew in China...\n\nEven though we are in no position to poll the Chinese population, we're willing to bet that Zahavi is the most famous Jew in China. Soccer is the country's most popular sport, and the Israeli striker tore up the Chinese league for five years. Playing for Guangzhou R\u0026F, he scored close to a goal per game, won one MVP award and two scoring titles. (He's since left China for a much higher level of competition in the Netherlands, and is doing well there as well.)\n\nSo, did we make the case? Fine, fine, Eran Zahavi is probably not the most famous Jew in the world.\n\nThat would have to be Drake.",
