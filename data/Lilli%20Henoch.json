  "description": "The women's discus world record has stood strong since 1988. Its holder? An East German. Yes, a country that hasn't existed since 1990 still has a hold of a world record.\n\nWhy hasn't it been broken since? Oh, there are theories, but considering the Eastern bloc's prowess in throwing events, the answer seems simple: steroids.\n\nSo let's go back all the way to the first ever women's discus world record, set in 1922, also by an East German. Well, an East Prussian. This is long before the Eastern bloc or steroids...\n\nLilli Henoch was quite an athlete. She set four world records, two of them in the discus, and won various German championships 10 times across four different sports. Unfortunately, she never got to participate in the Olympics, be it because of Germany being banned or Germany banning her for being a Jew. Even more unfortunately, she was killed in the Holocaust. Stupid Germans, East or otherwise.\n\nThe women's shot put world record has stood strong since 1984. Its holder? A Soviet. Yes, a country that hasn't existed since 1991 still has a hold of a world record.\n\nYou know who set the shot put record all the way back in 1925?\n\nLilli Henoch.",
