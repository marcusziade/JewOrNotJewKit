  "description": "If you've read the the Dustin Diamond profile (You haven't? For shame! You go read that profile right now or no more kugel for you!), you probably think you know where this is going.\n\nAfter all, \"That 70's Show\" is a teenage sitcom featuring beautiful people of both sexes and we all know the rules that come with that. So imagine our surprise to discover that That 70's Jew is none other than the lovely Mila Kunis.\n\nPart of the influx of ex-Soviet Jews in the early 90's, we have no idea how active Mila is in the Jewish community. Judging by her choice of boyfriend (Macaulay Culkin? Gevalt!), probably not much. But when you're in Maxim's Top 50 most beautiful women, well... we're willing to turn a blind eye. \n\nOf course, since the cancellation of her show, Mila's most prominent role is the voice of comically despised loser Meg on \"Family Guy\". \n\nNow that's more like it.",
