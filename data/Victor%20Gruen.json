  "description": "Victor Gruen had a dream. America was too suburban. All these little towns spread out, all these people with no place to go...\n\nThe mall. Gruen came up with the mall. A central place where all these suburbanites can congregate. Can walk around, can talk to others, can eat, can shop! It was to be a socialist paradise, but in America!\n\nAnd Gruen's dream became a reality. He designed the first shopping mall, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Soon, his creation spread through the country, state by state, suburb by suburb... Malls were everywhere. Gruen's vision was achieved. It was a socialist paradise!\n\nYeah, not so fast.\n\nSocialist paradise? Make it capitalist paradise. Gruen HATED what the mall became. He called them \"bastard developments\".\n\nThat'll teach you to have dreams...",
