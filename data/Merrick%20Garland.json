Scumbags.) So we pulled the Garland profile, since the land of failed Supreme Court nominations is full of various non-entities. (Remember the also-delightfully-named Robert Bork? Or George W.

Probably not.)\n\nWell, four rather insane years passed, and look at this, the man with the name of a spaceship captain is actually getting a rather important job: he will be the US Attorney General! (A big F. U. to the scumbags in the Senate, undoubtedly.) And with that... he is finally getting his JONJ profile.\n\nIf only other mistakes of the last four years were that easy to revert...",
