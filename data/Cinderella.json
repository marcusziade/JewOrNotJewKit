  "description": "\"Cinderella Finds Her Prince in the Jewish Region\", the headline read. We wonder...\n\n\"You call this a ball?!\", screamed the stepmother. \"What on earth is klez-mare? That's no ball!\"\n\n\"Klezmer is traditional Jewish music,\" answered Cinderella. \"It's usually...\"\n\n\"And the food! Oh, the atrocious food! Potato? I like my pancakes made out of dough, thank you very much!\"\n\n\"I think you're referring to latkes...\"\n\nWait, something is wrong. What's that picture doing here? Is this about Cinderella or a tiger? Apparently... both?\n\nThe confusing (real!) headline above was about a tiger who was recently released back into the wild. The tiger's name is Zolushka (Russian for Cinderella), and she met her \"prince\" while running around the Jewish Autonomous Region (aha!). The two mated, and Cinderella gave birth to cubs, the first released Amur tiger to do so. So she is a big deal, as far as conservationism goes.\n\nAs far as we are concerned...\n\n\"And that was no prince, I tell you that! What prince wears a beanie?...\"",
