  "description": "Stop it, Britney. It's not funny.\n\nWe Jews are usually a welcoming bunch. If someone wants to join our group, we wouldn't stand in their way. There are a few exceptions, of course... and this is one of them.\n\nYou see, it turns out that not only did Britney study the Kabbalah after encouragement from Madonna (although it's hard to use the words \"Britney\" and \"study\" in the same sentence), last year it was reported that she was considering converting to Judaism. Was it because she was dating a Jew, Isaac Cohen?\n\nWell, they are broken up now (please trust us, we had to look this up; we know nothing about Britney's dating history), so hopefully that thought (although it's hard to use the words \"Britney\" and \"thought\" in the same sentence) has left her head.\n\nCome on, Britney. Judaism is not a fad. There are so many other faiths you can try. Ever heard of Heaven's Gate?",
