Baseball?\n\nBut did you know that this most American of cars, the proud symbol of everything right about the U S of A, was designed by a Belgian-born, Russian-raised, German-living, French-army-serving, Jewish immigrant?\n\nZora Arkus-Duntov was born to a family of Russian Jews that was living in Belgium. After the Russian Revolution, they decided to move to the Soviet Union. Thankfully for young Zora, they soon realized their folly, and settled in Berlin.\n\nFrom there, it was off to France, where Zora joined the air force. When the Nazis came, he made the dash for it, and made it to America. Zora started to make car parts, eventually ending up at Chevrolet. There, he created the iconic automobile.\n\nSo, yes, the Corvette was designed by a Belgian-born, Russian-raised, German-living, French-army-serving, Jewish immigrant.\n\nWhat's more American than that? Nothing!",
