Yes, chef!\n\nAnd if you love \"The Bear\", it's quite likely that you are shipping Carmy and Sydney. (For our older audience: \"shipping\" means the desire for them to get together.) Carmy! Sydney! They belong with each other!\n\nMeh. WHAT ABOUT CLAIRE?\n\nSeriously, what the hell happened with Claire?! No major spoilers here, but in the recently-released season, she only appears in flashbacks... and then in one scene. One scene in ten episodes! It's like they didn't want to pay Molly Gordon!\n\nWell, we might be in the minority here, but it's Carmy and Claire we're shipping. No, it has nothing to do with the fact that Gordon is Jewish in real life. We just hope that \"The Bear\" escapes the trap of putting its two leading characters, Carmy and Sydney, together, just because they are... its two leading characters.\n\nCarmy and Sydney? No, chef!",
