What are records, tapes, and compact disks? Jeez...\n\nBack in the day, before you could download music, one would actually have to purchase (gasp!) physical media (records, tapes, compact disks) to play on a physical machine (turntable, tape deck, CD player). And that physical media was sold in music stores, usually staffed by long-haired dweeby clerks with nothing better to do than criticize your taste in music... Well, we have no taste in music!\n\nWhich brings us to Sam Goody, the man and the store. The man was born Samuel Gutowitz. The store was opened in 1951 and spread through America's malls soon after. The man actually changed his name to match the store. The stores peaked at 800 before reducing to, as of this writing... two.\n\nYes, gone are the days when each mall housed a music store.\n\nYou know what we don't miss? Malls.",
