  "description": "If you have been recently watching the World Cup (and we have recently been watching the World Cup), you might have noticed a player by the name of Jewison Bennette. Or, most likely, you didn't notice him: he plays for Costa Rica, which promptly crashed out. And yet, Jewison! What gives?\n\nLet's just say that strange first names are pretty common for South American soccer players. In fact, there is a trend of turning last names into first. Who can forget another Costa Rican, Yeltsin Tejada, named, yes, after Boris Yeltsin? To stay completely in the world of soccer, there were Boniek Garcia of Honduras and Djorkaeff Reasco of Ecuador, named after former World Cup players Zbigniew Boniek of Poland and Youri Djorkaeff of France, respectively.\n\nSo, who was Jewison Bennette named after? (Not Norman Jewison, right?) Turns out it's another soccer player, also a Costa Rican international: his father, Jewison Bennette!\n\nAnd who was that Jewison Bennette named after?\n\nWe have no idea.",
