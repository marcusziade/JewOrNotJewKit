  "description": "We were at a street fair recently, which means carnival rides, cotton candy, and clowns. And, apparently, a chance to buy dead people's record collections.\n\nThat's right, boxes of boxes of records which were once collected piece-by-piece, treasured by someone, now available to buy for one measly dollar. Not exactly the happiest stand at the street fair.\n\nThe boxes were arranged by genre, meticulously labeled: from rock 'n' roll, to punk, to death metal. Yes, there was a huge box dedicated to death metal. We were afraid to ask the seller where he got it from. As a rule, we don't speak to strangers wearing a sweater vest... and nothing underneath. It's a good rule, trust us.\n\nBut even though we wouldn't go near the seller, and even though death metal isn't exactly our cup of tea (grunting is best left for the bedroom), when we got home, we read up on the history of the genre. And what we found is that Chuck Schuldiner, the front man of the band \"Death\" (clever name there), called by many \"The Father of Death Metal\", was Jewish.\n\nSo you see, at least one good thing came out from attending a street fair.\n\nClowns? Don't get us started.",
