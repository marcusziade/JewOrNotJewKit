  "description": "In his entire life, Daniel Kahnemann has never taken a single economics course.\n\nKahnemann won the Nobel in Economics in 2002. How does one explain this?\n\nKahnemann is really a psychologist. (In fact, he served in the psychology department in the IDF!) Of course, there is no Nobel in Psychology.\n\nMuch of Kahnemann's work is in the field of decision theory. A lot of that crossed over from psychology and began to be applied to the broader world. It became known as \"behavioral economics\".\n\nThe Nobel committee must have seen \"economics\" in the title and gave Kahnemann the prize. We're not complaining. The more Nobel Jews, the merrier.\n\nNo, we're thinking, can we somehow twist our own skills and earn a backdoor Nobel? Heck, we've even taken some economics courses!",
