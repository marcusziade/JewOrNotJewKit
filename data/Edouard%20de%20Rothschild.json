  "description": "The 2016 Olympics are promising to be special because two sports are making their long-awaited return. Golf and rugby, absent at the Summer Games for close to a century, are both on the schedule for Rio.\n\nOne sport that is not coming back? Polo.\n\nThat's right, polo (yes, POLO) was an Olympic sport five times. When it debuted at the 1900 Games, five teams took part. The one of interest to us is Bagatelle Polo Club de Paris, who finished joint third with Mexico (yes, in 1900, MEXICO had a NATIONAL POLO TEAM). Bagatelle  featured two Brits and two Frenchmen, including one Edouard Alphonse James de Rothschild (yes, a member of the Rothschild dynasty), quite likely the only Jewish polo medalist in the history of the Olympics.\n\nPolo last appeared in the Summer Games in 1936, and has since been relegated to goyishe country clubs, Ralph Lauren shirts, and a somewhat memorable scene in \"Pretty Woman\". And no, it's not coming back to the Olympics.\n\nAnd neither is tug-of-war, absent since 1920.\n\nNow THAT one is a shame.",
