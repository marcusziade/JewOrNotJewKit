  "description": "\"I like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em.\" — Ned Flanders\n\nIf you watch a Woody Allen movie...\n\n(Here we pause. Yes, one cannot discuss Woody Allen without bringing up the baggage. Let's just make a clear separation between the man and his work and move on. For a moment.)\n\nYou will most likely run into the Woody Allen character. You know the type: nerdy, nervous, brilliant, awkward, astute. He is usually a writer, or is in some other creative profession. He is most often played by Woody himself, but not always.\n\nThere are variations. Sometimes he's goyishe (Owen Wilson, \"Midnight in Paris\"), sometimes he's a woman (Scarlett Johansson, \"Scoop\"), sometimes he's Timothee Chalamet (Timothee Chalamet, \"A Rainy Day in New York\"). Did we mention he is irresistible to women? Oh, that Woody.\n\n(Back to the pause.)\n\nBecause of that overwhelming baggage, Woody's time as an American filmmaker seems to be finished. His last movie, \"Coup de Chance\", is completely French — French title, French dialogue, French actors, French locations, French producers, French distributors. Even the Woody Allen character (played by Niels Schneider), still a nerdy/nervous/brilliant/awkward/astute writer who is irresistible to women, is, of course, French. (In real life, Schneider is Jewish on his father's side. Might be the reason why Woody picked him.)\n\nAt this point, it's not clear if Woody will make another film. Probably for the best... He's running out of actors who are willing to become the Woody Allen character, even if it is only for one movie.",
