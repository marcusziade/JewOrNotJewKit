  "description": "There is a small number of couples who have both won Olympic gold medals: Figure skates Carol Heiss and Hayes Jenkins are one example. More recently, Korean archers Park Sung-Hyun and Park Kyung-Mo married after both took home gold.\n\nOnly a few couples have both won Oscars, including Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward and Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh.\n\nThere are only two couples that both have World Series of Poker bracelets: Max and Maria Stern (Jews!) and Harry and Jeri Thomas.\n\nAt least four couples both have a Pulitzer Prize. Five couples have been awarded the Nobel Prize (if you can name the others besides the Curies, well, maybe you need to get out more). \n\nThe number of couples to score a perfect 15 on Jew or Not Jew? Just one: Gilda Radner and, as of today, Gene Wilder. \n\nIt's an odd privilege, we suppose, but it's also a unique one â€” the least we can do for such an odd, uniquely talented man.",
