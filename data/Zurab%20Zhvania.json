  "description": "On February 3, 2005, Zurab Zhvania, the first and only Jewish Prime Minister of Georgia (the country, not the state, duh), was found dead. According to the official version, he and a friend, fellow politician Raul Usupov, were discovered in the latter's apartment. It was ruled a gas poisoning from a newly-installed heater.\n\nExcept...\n\nThe apartment was not Usupov's\nThe landlord claimed that the heater was not installed three days ago, as stated in the official report, but three months, and was functioning properly\nNo fingerprints of Zhvania or Usupov were found in the apartment\nThe President of Georgia called Zhvania's death a murder, before correcting himself\n\nSo what really happened? Well, two theories: either a cover-up of a torrid gay love affair, or...\n\nThe President of Georgia had Zhvania killed over a huge business deal gone bad. We're betting on that one.",
