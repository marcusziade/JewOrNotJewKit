  "description": "When we were in college, our dorm (150 people) had just one TV. Which was fine, most of the time. When you're in college, watching TV is not exactly your top priority. So more often than not, the lone TV stayed idle.\n\nBut not on in the fall of 1997, when the vast majority of those 150 people huddled in the tiny media room on Wednesday nights. Jocks and nerds, burnouts and cheerleaders (wait, did we even have cheerleaders in our dorm? Let's say yes, for the sake of this profile)... \"South Park\" was on. \"South Park\" could not be missed.\n\nEveryone had their favorite character. For some it was Stan, the leader. For others, Cartman, the evil asshole, or Kenny, the one who always died. But our favorite has always been Kyle. The Jewish one, of course.\n\nKyle was based on Matt Stone, the Jewish co-creator of the show... or so we thought. You see, while Kyle is 100% Jewish, Stone is not. He is half by blood, agnostic, and considers himself \"ethnically Jewish, but that's about all.\"\n\nThanks a lot, Matt. Thanks for ruining our happy college memories.",
