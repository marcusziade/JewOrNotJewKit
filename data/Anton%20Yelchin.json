A Russian among Americans (and a Vulcan). At the height of the Cold War. (Well, Star Trek didn't take place at the height of Cold War. It was filmed at the height of the Cold War. So the notion that Americans and Russians could, theoretically, get along, even in a distant and star-roaming future, was iffy at best.)\n\nOf course, Russian actors were scarce in Hollywood, so Chekov was played by Walter Koenig. (Russian: No. Jewish: Yes.) And four decades passed.\n\nThe Cold War was over, not due to future inter-galactic friendship, but due to bubble gum and blue jeans. And when \"Star Trek\" was remade in 2009, casting a Russian as Chekov was no longer a problem. In theory.\n\nOf course, to Americans, the new Chekov, Soviet-born Anton Yelchin is Russian. But to Russians...\n\nHerein lies the dilemma, at the heart of which is definition of nationality and ethnicity. In America, Yelchin is considered a Russian, and now a Russian American (after becoming a US citizen) because of his birthplace. In Russia, because Yelchin's family is ethnically Jewish (and yes, in Russia, as throughout Europe, Jewishness is considered an ethnicity), he will never be considered a Russian, but rather a Jew, and now an American Jew.\n\nSo, maybe Americans and Russians can't get along, even in a distant future.
