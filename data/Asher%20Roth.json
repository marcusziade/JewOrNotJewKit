  "description": "\"A nice Jewish boy rapper.\"\n\n\"Rap's first white Jewish superstar since the Beastie Boys.\"\n\n\"The Jewish Eminem.\"\n\nThe man described above? Asher Roth. Coming from the mean Pennsylvania suburbs (East siiiiiiiiiide), he raps about cheap pizza and beer pong. Clearly, America's Jewish college students have a new musical hero.\n\nOr perhaps not. For Roth is only a quarter Jewish, on his father's side, and is quick to dismiss it. He does not practice Judaism and does not consider himself a Jew. He even points out that his oh-so-Jewish first name comes from his mother's Irish side of the family.\n\nSo, the Jewish Eminem? Not so much. But we tell you what, at least that's better than being called the Jewish Vanilla Ice.",
