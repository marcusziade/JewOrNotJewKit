  "description": "In our profile of Lindsey Vuolo, written over a decade ago, we claimed that she claimed that she was \"Playboy's first openly Jewish playmate\". The key word is \"openly\", we guess?\n\nThere were definitely Jewish playmates before Lindsey, who appeared in November 2001. Heck, we even profiled one: Ellen Michaels (March 1972; Vuolo wasn't even born yet!) She probably didn't \"openly\" discuss her Jewishness?\n\nIn any case, Playboy's first (non-openly?) Jewish playmate was most likely Cindy Fuller, who featured all the way back in May 1959. How do we know that she was Jewish? Well, apparently, she claimed to be Playboy's first Jewish playmate!\n\nYou know, as we are writing this, we can't help but give pause. Does it really matter who was Playboy's first Jewish playmate, openly or not? Vuolo claimed so, fine, Fuller claimed so, fine! Is this just an excuse for us to search for Jewish playmates and try to bypass Google's \"explicit content\" filter? Is that really what we are reduced to?\n\nYes. Determining the first Jewish playmate is very important. Just don't expect us to start JewishPlaymateOrNotJewishPlaymate.com.",
