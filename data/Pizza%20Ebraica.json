  "description": "In this profile, we're going to claim that Jews invented pizza.\n\nBefore anyone starts screaming, \"Naples!\", or, alternatively, \"New York!\", calm down please. When did this alleged invention of pizza in Naples or New York take place? The 19th century. Well, today, on the streets of Rome, you can purchase something called \"Pizza dolce di Beridde\", whose origins date back to the 15th century. Its other name? \"Pizza Ebraica\". You want to guess what that translates to?\n\nJewish pizza. (And, while we're at it, \"Berride\" comes from \"Brit milah\", the ceremony of circumcision, which... ewwww.) So, what gives?\n\nWell, Jewish pizza is not exactly what we think of as pizza. It's more of a sweetbread, made with almonds, raisins, candied fruits, olive oil, and wine. (Doesn't exactly sound appetizing...) It was brought to Italy by Jews who were kicked out of Spain in 1492 and was originally served during circumcisions. (There's that ewwww.)\n\nSo while we can't really claim that Jews invented MODERN pizza, they did invent a food still eaten today, which is also called pizza.\n\nOh, hell. Why are we arguing with semantics? Jews invented pizza.",
