  "description": "In the late 60s, three friends, Donald Fagen, Walter Becker, and Cornelius Chase played in a band named The Leather Canary. Chase soon left. It was a decision that had huge ramifications.\n\nSoon after Chase's departure, Fagen and Becker formed Steely Dan. The band quickly rose up the charts and became a hugely influential 70s icon. After a respite in the 80s, they reunited in 1993 and are still jamming to this day. Chase? Well, \"Cornelius\" might not ring a bell, but you might know him as \"Chevy\".\n\nSo, what would have happened if Chevy stayed with his friends?  Maybe he becomes part of Steely Dan, but who knows if it becomes as successful. Maybe it never goes anywhere and Fagen and Becker move on to writing for magazines and growing avocados (which they actually did during the 80s).\n\nAs for Chevy, if he doesn't move into comedy, the whole history of Saturday Night Live gets completely rewritten. We'd have no Vacation movies, no Fletch...\n\nAnd no five fabulous weeks of the Chevy Chase Show. Not all of these changes are bad, mind you.",
