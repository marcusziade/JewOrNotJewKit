  "description": "We've previously mentioned our disdain for ESPN's \"Around the Horn\". Sometimes, we tune in to \"Pardon the Interruption\" a little early, and are forced to sit through supposed journalists screaming at each other. The mute button comes in handy.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. It used to be WORSE.\n\nFor currently, \"Horn\" is hosted by Tony Reali, who, for all his faults, at least is not a smug jackass. Which is what the original host of the show, Max Kellerman, was.\n\nHowever, before ESPN decided that having cross-country shouting matches was a good idea, Kellerman was a rising star on the network. He was receiving universal praise as a boxing analyst, so ESPN tried to expand his role... And we got \"Horn\".\n\nWell, Kellerman got fired from that, went to Fox Sports and the even-more-unwatchable ego trip \"I, Max\" (yes, it was WORSE than \"Horn\"), got fired from that, and is now trying to get back to the basics by doing boxing on HBO.\n\nDon't believe us how terrible he is? Well, let's let media critics have their say. \"Setting a new low.\" (Sports Illustrated) \"Megalomanical, boorish, insecure, annoying.\" (Chicago Tribune) \"Immensely unlikable.\" (New York Times)\n\n\"Jewish.\" (Jew or Not Jew)\n\nSigh.\n\n(Editor's update, 2020: It's been over a decade since this was written, but it looks like Max grew as a person and a television host. Remove the sigh?)",
