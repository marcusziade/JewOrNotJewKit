  "description": "Ah, yet another interfaith profile. These often give us so much trouble. Let's see if we can figure this one out.\n\nTommy Pickles' father, Stu, is Christian. Tommy Pickles' mother, Didi, is Jewish (her parents, Boris and Minka Kropotkin, are as stereotypically Jewish as humanly possible). So far so good.\n\nTommy goes to Hebrew school and studies for his bar mitzvah. His family celebrates Hanukkah. So far so great.\n\nBut... Tommy's family celebrates Christmas and Easter as well. So far so... average?\n\nShort of getting a direct quote from Tommy himself (and his interview availability is somewhat impaired by his animated state), we're at a bind here. All signs point to \"Jew\", but those Christmas/Easter celebrations might just push it to the \"Borderline\" verdict.\n\nBut you know what? We're not gonna let it. While it's clear that the Pickles tried to keep traditions from both sides of the family, it looks like the Jewish side clearly outweighs the Christian one. It's not like Tommy goes to Catholic school. Or is getting confirmed. Or whatever other meshuggenah things Christians do.\n\nNo, we're willing to bet that Christian holidays was the one concession Didi had to make to get Stu to raise the kids Jewish. Marriage (even in an animated state) is all about giving the woman what she wants compromise, isn't it?",
