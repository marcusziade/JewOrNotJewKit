  "description": "This year's NFL Hall of Fame vote was one of the highest contested in history. Because of the way retirements and past votes fell, in 2011 you could make a very strong case for each of the finalists. Unfortunately for them, the NFL only allows five to be voted in each year (plus two on the senior ballot).\n\nSo who made it to the five? What superstar athletes, Super Bowl champions, physical freaks were elected to join the pro football immortals? Well, four of them fit the mold. The fifth... not quite.\n\nFor joining the likes of Marshall Faulk and Deion Sanders (Not a Jew, Not a Jew) is 94-year-old Ed Sabol, who never played a down in the NFL. (Interestingly, he was a collegiate champion swimmer in the 30s.) Sabol (yes, Jew, in case it wasn't clear why we're profiling him) founded NFL Films, which is largely credited for preserving NFL history and building the league's popularity from the back pages in the 1960s to the gargantuan behemoth of today.\n\nSo, Ed Sabol, worthy NFL Hall of Famer.\n\nAnd that's worth more than any touchdown, sack, or field goal.",
