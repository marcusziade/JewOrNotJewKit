  "description": "12th of October, 1492:Made landfall. I am not sure what language these natives are speaking, but it's definitely not Hebrew or Aramaic. Urdu, perhaps?\n\n15th of October, 1492:It's Sukkot. Went to the jungle to build a little tent. Old habits die hard.\n\n21st of October, 1942:I doubt that these are the Lost Tribes of Israel. Will keep mouth shut for now.\n\n27th of October, 1492:All this \"convert the heavens\" nonsense is getting on my nerves. I know I'm supposed to be a good Catholic now, but puh-lease.\n\n2nd of November, 1492:Rodrigo de Jerez and I are being sent inland. Columbus wants us to find the Great Khan. What a dope.\n\n3rd of November, 1492:The natives are friendly. The women are welcoming.\n\n7th of November, 1492:Rodrigo has spent the last four days inside the hut of the village elder. I tried to enter it, but it was filled with smoke. Started coughing and couldn't stop for hours. Decided to go back to the women.\n\n10th of November, 1492:The village elder carried Rodrigo out of the hut. His teeth are an unhealthy shade of brown.\n\n12th of November, 1492:Rodrigo came to this morning. He keeps telling me to try this \"tobacco\". I like my teeth bright yellow, thank you very much.\n\n13th of November, 1492:Heading back to the coast. Hopefully Columbus hasn't sailed. Yet... I kinda like this island. The women are welcoming, after all. If only I could get used to all the smoking.\n\nLuis de Torres, a marrano who took part in Columbus' first voyage, is said to be the first European to discover tobacco.",
