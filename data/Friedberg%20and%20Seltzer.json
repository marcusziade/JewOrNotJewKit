  "description": "Remember when spoof movies were great? Blazing Saddles? Young Frankenstein? Airplane? Spaceballs? Naked Gun? Hot Shots?\n\nThose times are long gone. Mel Brooks, Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, and Leslie Nielsen have given way to something awful. In fact, \"awful\" is not strong enough to describe it. Abominable. Atrocious. Deplorable. Repulsive. \n\nThe Jews currently running the spoof business are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. That's the duo behind such gems as Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Vampires Suck...\n\nVampires are not the only ones that suck. Have you tried to watch one of those movies? Please don't. We beg you. You will never get those minutes of your life back. We say \"minutes\", because if you stick around for hours, you will get brain damage. Please don't get brain damage!\n\nBut here is the strange thing: some people don't mind the brain damage. All those movies made money! Lots and lots of money. And that's why Friedberg and Seltzer keep working, making dreck after dreck after dreck.\n\nAnd here is another strange thing: Friedberg and Seltzer got their start as writers on Spy Hard, starring... Leslie Nielsen.\n\nPerhaps spoof movies were not as great as we remember?",
