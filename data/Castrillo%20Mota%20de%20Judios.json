  "description": "Today, we're going to visit a lovely town... village... hamlet? in northern Spain. Population: 52. Not 52,000 or 5200. Fifty-two. Completely unremarkable if not for its name: Castrillo Mota de Judios.\n\nPerhaps not completely unremarkable: it was settled almost a millennium ago, all the way back in 1035. And the village's seal is quite nice too. Is that a piano?\n\nIt's not the musical instrument that concerns us, of course, it's the Star of David above it. Goes right along with the hamlet's remarkable name, which translates to \"Jew hill camp\". What a fantastic moniker!\n\nThe town's original name was actually the very similar Castrillo Motajudios, as it was named for Jews who settled there. It reverted to its current name only in 2015, after spending close to 400 years being known as Castrillo Matajudios... Which could, but probably not by original intent, be translated as \"Jew killer camp\".\n\nRemarkable indeed.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('c/castrillo_mota_de_judios','castrillo');\n}",
