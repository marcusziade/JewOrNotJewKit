  "description": "Not many people know this, but after Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden, they sublet an apartment from a young Frank Lautenberg for six months before they found a place of their own.\n\nIn 1215, when the English were drafting the Magna Carta, they actually ran out of parchment, but they were able to purchase more from Frank Lautenberg's shop down the street.\n\nAnd during the Civil War, it was Frank Lautenberg who, because of a late business meeting, gave his seats at Ford's Theater to Abraham Lincoln. \n\nNowadays, Frank Lautenberg is a senator for the state of New Jersey. He's also really really really old (OK, he's only 84, but still).\n\nAs a senator, he hasn't done anything for us to complain about, which is the highest praise we can bestow. He'll be running again in 2008, which means eventually we'll have to update this profile with Frank's many adventures flying cars around Venus or whatever else this ageless wonder gets himself into.",
