  "description": "We were watching some TV show the other day (they have all started to blend together), when we saw this actress playing a tough-talking lawyer. Wait a minute, we said to ourselves. Didn't we just see this very same person play a tough-talking lawyer on another show? (They have all started to blend together...)\n\nWe did. Her name is Michaela Watkins, she had a rather forgettable one-year stint on Saturday Night Live in the late 2000s, and, despite the rather goyishe last name, she is Jewish. Since leaving SNL, she has had a productive career on TV, not always playing lawyers.\n\nBut Watkins is more than a one-note actress. For example, in 2014, she got behind the camera, creating a sitcom...\n\nAbout lawyers.\n\nHave they all started to blend together for Michaela?",
