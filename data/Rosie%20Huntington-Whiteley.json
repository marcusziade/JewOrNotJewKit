  "description": "Beware, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Beware.\n\nBeware the Curse of Estella Warren.\n\nIn 2000, Maxim magazine, that forerunner of the soft porn industry, debuted its Hot 100 list, the ranking of the hottest women in the world. The top spot went to Warren, a former synchronized swimmer virtually unheard of outside the modeling world.\n\nWell, Warren decided to branch out, landing plump movie roles in \"Planet of the Apes\" (as the human female, the role she was born to play!) and \"Driven\" (Sylvester Stallone as an aging race car driver. Stay away at all costs). Unfortunately for Warren, she couldn't act a lick, and her career plummeted quicker than its started. When \"Kangaroo Jack\" is the highlight of your decade, that doesn't say much for the rest of it.\n\nSo this year, Maxim once again decided to give the top spot to someone most of the world has not heard of. Yes, Huntington-Whiteley, who, just like Warren, is a supermodel who can't wait to try out acting. (Unlike Warren, she is actually 3/8 Jewish, goyishe last name monstrosity be damned. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from Poland to England to escape the pogroms.) You'll see Rosie on the big screen soon enough, as she replaces Megan Fox as the lead in the third installment of \"Transformers\". Needless to say, we don't have much hope for the movie or for its new star's acting ability.\n\nBeware the Curse of Warren-Huntington-Whiteley?",
