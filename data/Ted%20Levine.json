  "description": "Some of us have the annoying habit of not being able to drop a television show. This is how we end up watching the terrible final seasons of once-enjoyable \"The Office\" and \"Entourage\". It doesn't just extend to comedy: there's supposed serious fair, such as \"The Bridge\".\n\nWe read the reviews and watched the pilot and were intrigued. It looked like a quality show. So week after week we're tuning in, and...\n\nAnd it's not bad. There are parts of it, especially the leads as played by Diane Kruger and Demian Bichir, that are rather excellent. But once you get past that... most of the other actors are pretty terrible, and many of the storylines are just not interesting.\n\nBut, for some reason, we continue watching. Or half-watching, intersecting the show with googling pictures of Kruger (was \"Troy\" a major letdown or what?) and trying to figure out if \"Hey, it's THAT guy!\" alum Ted Levine is Jewish. (He was Buffalo Bill in \"Silence of the Lambs\"? Creepy...)\n\nIn any case, we can't wait for the season to end. And hope against hope there is not going to be a Season 2...",
