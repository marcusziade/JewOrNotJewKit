  "description": "Spring is in the air, so it's time to set up our fantasy baseball team. Here's what we've got so far.\n\nStarting pitcher: Jason Marquis, Chicago Cubs \n\nRelief pitcher: Scott Schoeneweis, New York Mets\n\nOutfielders: Shawn Green, New York Mets. Adam Stern, Baltimore Orioles. Gabe Kapler, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nCatcher: Brad Ausmus, Houton Astros\n\nFirst Base: Kevin Youkilis, Boston Red Sox\n\nThird Base: Ryan Braun, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nSecond Base: Ian Kinsler, Texas Rangers\n\nShortstop: ??? Uh-oh.  \n\nPoor Kinsler's got a lot of ground to cover out there unless our exhaustive search turns up with someone soon. \n\nSeriously, if you're Jewish and not bad with the glove, can you get out there and play some shortstop? Otherwise our team is in serious trouble.",
