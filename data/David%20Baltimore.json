We fudged the numbers.\n\nOne little stroke, and that unacceptable 11 becomes a palatable 14. It's all within that margin of error, isn't it? Sorry, distinguished science teachers.\n\nDavid Baltimore, Jew, Nobel Prize laureate (at the age of 37!) never fudged his numbers. Unfortunately for him, his colleagues tended to.\n\nFirst, it was Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who co-authored a paper with Baltimore. She was accused of, well, fudging numbers. Baltimore first stood by her, but then was forced to retract the paper. This led to major backlash as he resigned as president of Rockefeller University.\n\nThen, it was Luk Van Parijs, who co-authored with Baltimore while the two were at Caltech. Once again, Baltimore resigned as president. Van Parijs even ended up being sentenced to prison. Baltimore, by all accounts, is currently doing well.\n\nBetter than us, at least. Maybe we shouldn't have been more careful about fudging those numbers in science class...",
