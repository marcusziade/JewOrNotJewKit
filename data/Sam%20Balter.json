  "description": "The basketball tournament is always one of the most eagerly awaited events at every Summer Olympics. Who can wait for the US to wipe the floor with the likes of Nigeria, Venezuela, and Lithuania! (Except that one time when they lost to Lithuania... but we digress.)\n\nAmerica's dominance (they have won 18 of the 22 men's gold medals) began all the way back in 1936. In Berlin (Oh those darn Nazi Olympics, we keep discussing them, for better or for worse! But we digress again.), the US won the first ever basketball gold medal.\n\nOn that team was Sam Balter, who, as a Jew, hesitated about going to Nazi Germany, but did return with the gold. Balter, who played college ball at UCLA, became more famous as a broadcaster, calling his alma mater's football and basketball games.\n\nSo, how did Balter do in the tournament? He scored seven points against Estonia and led the team with 10 as they beat Mexico in the semifinal. It is not known why he missed the final, which was played outdoors in a pouring rain. The US beat that massive powerhouse Canada, 19:8.\n\nThat is not a typo.",
