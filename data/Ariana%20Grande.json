  "description": "Unless you've been living under a rock, it's been pretty hard to escape the juggernaut that is the film version of \"Wicked\". But, despite this being the Ariana Grande profile, we're not here to talk about the movie musical. At least not THAT movie musical.\n\nWe're here to talk about \"Pitch Perfect 3\". What's this, you say? Miss Grande is not in that one? Hold your horses, we'll explain.\n\nNo, we haven't seen PP3. (How could we, not having seen \"Pitch Perfect 1\" or \"2\"! We would be lost in the story!) Apparently, at some point in the movie, the gang (there is a gang, right?) decide to sing songs from \"artists you didn't know were Jewish\". So off they go: Lenny Kravitz, check. Adam Levine, check. Beyonce? Ariana Grande? No, no, a thousand times no!\n\nWe really don't know what the creators of PP3 were thinking, but this is on you, screenwriters Kay Cannon and Mike White! (Wait, the same Mike White who created \"The White Lotus\" and finished runner-up on Survivor co-wrote \"Pitch Perfect 3\"? Really?) Kravitz and Levine, sure! But Beyonce... Ariana Grande? She is 100% Italian, with not a drop of Hebrew heritage. (Grande is on record on visiting a Kabbalah Center, but she is a pop star. It would be weird if she didn't.)\n\nSo, did we see \"Wicked\"? So far, we've managed to avoid that juggernaut... But only because we've been living under a rock.",
