Together with him were: his secretary, his butler, two stenographers, the pilot, and the co-pilot.\n\nLoewenstein went to the bathroom and didn't return. Three weeks later, his body was fished out of the channel.\n\nWhat happened? Was he a subject of an Agatha Christie-like mystery? (The butler did it, right?) A victim of an international conspiracy? Did he willingly commit suicide? Or did he just... open the wrong door?\n\nNobody knows for sure. In fact, one theory says that he faked his own death. (Did he hide in an overhead compartment?)\n\nHere is a side note: two months before his death, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency ran this line:\n\nAlfred Loewenstein, Belgian Millionaire, Denies He is a Jew\n\nNow THAT doesn't make any sense...",
