Dee was raised Christian, sang in a church choir, and still proclaims to be a follower of the Jesus, but he had a Jewish father. So it would be impossible to go higher than a 3.\n\nDee Snider would probably get a 1 on the O Score. After all, look at him! That is not a face that is welcome in your neighborhood church. In fact, there could be some debate to actually give him a big fat 0. But heck, the man loves his Jesus, so bump him up to a 1.\n\nDee Snider would probably get a 3 on the K... wait, goyim don't kvell. P Score for Pride? (We know there are other connotations of that word, goyim, but let it go, please.) Yeah, a 3 sounds about right.\n\nSo add that all up and that gives Dee a Christian Score of 3/1/3 for a total of 7...\n\nWait, that's his Jew Score too?",
