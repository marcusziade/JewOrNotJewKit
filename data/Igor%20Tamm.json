  "description": "If this was EstonianOrNotEstonian.com, Igor Tamm would be a prime candidate for a profile. You see, the name \"Tamm\" is quite popular in Estonia, so many have claimed that the 1958 Nobel laureate in Physics is Estonian!\n\nBut this is not EstonianOrNotEstonian.com, so there is another pesky rumor about Tamm. Heck, if you go to Wikipedia, there are NINE links referencing it. Oh, you guessed it, but we will let Igor's great-grandson, Mikhail Tamm, explain:\n\n\nI discovered while reading Wikipedia that there is apparently a group of people who for some reason find it very important to prove that Igor is a Jew. So I will reassure them: he was not a Jew, that is absolutely certain.\n\n\nAccording to Mikhail, Tamm's last name came from Germany, and most of his heritage came from Russia and Ukraine. Mikhail also clarifies that it has nothing to do with Estonia either.\n\nHowever, Mikhail, himself a physicist, left the Russian nonsense behind and now lives and works in... Estonia.",
