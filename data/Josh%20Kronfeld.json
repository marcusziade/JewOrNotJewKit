  "description": "Having recently visited New Zealand (yes, we're writing about New Zealand again), we learned a few things about the locals. For instance, the only sport that matters is rugby.\n\nSure, New Zealanders play numerous sports, and are quite good in a lot of them, from sailing to rowing to canoeing (you might be noticing a pattern there). But none of those hold the candle to rugby, the undisputed king.\n\nThe All-Blacks, as the national team is nicknamed, is the three-time World Cup champion, with two runner-up finishes and two third places to boot. They are the ones who do the haka, the traditional maori dance, before games. The women's side (the Black Ferns) is even more successful, winning the title six out of the last seven competitions.\n\nJews? Well, not too many Jews in New Zealand, and not too many of them play rugby, but Josh Kronfeld, part Samoan, part German Jew, was one such rarity. He played for the All-Blacks 54 times in the late 1990s, including the 1999 World Cup, one of the few they did not medal in.\n\nWhat else did we learn? A bunch of stuff about the Maori culture, including cannibalistic rituals... No Jews involved in those, even as a rarity.",
