  "description": "Jaffa cakes, although virtually unknown in America, are one of Britain's top-selling cakes... or is it top-selling biscuits (British word for cookies)? They're made of chocolate, sponge cake, and orange jam. Absolutely delicious, if you ask us.\n\nThe cake or biscuit debate sounds like Britain's equivalent of \"is hot dog a sandwich\"... except it was taken to court. You see, in the UK, cakes and biscuits are taxed differently, so it was beneficial for the manufacturer that they were classified as cakes. Which, despite being the size of a cookie (biscuit), they were. The fact that they had \"cake\" in the name played a role in the decision.\n\nOf course, this is not CakeOrNotCake.com, so... why Jaffa? They are named for Jaffa oranges, a variety of the fruit developed in Palestine and exported to England in the 19th century. In fact, these oranges were seen as a great collaboration between Arab farmers and Jewish agriculturists. (See, we could all get along, if we bond over fruit...)\n\nSo... Jew or Not Jew? Perhaps having \"Jaffa\" in the name should play a role in the decision?",
