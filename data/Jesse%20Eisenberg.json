  "description": "It seems that every few years, a movie comes out that everyone raves about, a movie that receives both popular and critical acclaim, but one that we just don't care to watch.\n\n\"Titanic\" is the perfect example. Star-crossed lovers! DiCaprio! Big boat! Romance! Iceberg! Spare us. We all know how it ends. Death. We don't need to spend three hours plopped in a theater seat to get to that conclusion.\n\nLast year, it was \"The Social Network\". Oh my G-d! You must see this! Facebook! Thought-provoking! Nuanced! Masterful! The movie for our times! And did we mention Facebook!\n\nOnce again, spare us. Once again, we know how it ends. Nerd (previously profiled Mark Zuckerberg, Jew, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Jew) creates Facebook. Nerd pisses off others. Nerd becomes filthy rich. Do we really need to sit through that?\n\n\"Braveheart\"? Don't get us started.",
