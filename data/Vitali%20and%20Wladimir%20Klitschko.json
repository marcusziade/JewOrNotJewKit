  "description": "In a recent study, it was suggested that the latest group to suffer from unfair stereotyping is... (insert mental drumroll here)... jocks!\n\nY'see, people meet athletes and assume that they are — to use the politically correct term — stupid. These physically gifted folks, according to the study, internalize this belief and therefore are unable to achieve academically as they ordinarily ought.\n\nThe study overlooks a very important factor: most athletes are assumed to be stupid because they are stupid. For instance, John Smoltz, former pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, once burned himself while ironing his shirt — a shirt he was wearing at the time. And Smoltz is generally considered one of the more cerebral of his ilk.\n\nWho gets labeled as the dumbest athletes of all? Probably boxers. After all, the whole sport is based around hitting your opponent. In the head. Until they fall down. So even someone of advanced mental capacity probably won't stay that way for long. \n\nSo how weird then are the Klitschko brothers? Hulking co-champion boxers, Vitali and Wladimir look like they stepped right out of the script for Rocky 4.5. That is until they climb over the ropes and sit down for some chess. Wladimir is involved with multiple charitable organizations, while Vitali actually has a doctorate (!?) and currently serves in the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nWaitaminute. Doctor? Chess? That sounds suspiciously like another, very different stereotype, doesn't it?",
