  "description": "This summer, the Cleveland Indians, a downtrodden franchise if there ever was one, found themselves in contention. So the Tribe called up a minor leaguer to shore up their deficiencies at second base: Jason Kipnis.\n\nAnd we at JONJ, even those of us who are not into baseball, rejoiced. For Kipnis is not only considered one of the best prospects in the sport, he was also supposedly Jewish. And to add a talented youngster to the list of Jewish Major Leaguers... Well, can't go wrong with that.\n\nStill, we were going to hold off profiling Kipnis. After all, who knows if he'll ever amount to anything in the bigs. But after Kipnis hit home runs in three consecutive games, it started to look that we would profile him sooner rather than later.\n\nSo here we are with the revelation that, alas, Kipnis, although a member of the Tribe, is not exactly a member of the Tribe. Although half-Jewish through his father, he is now a practicing, crucifix-wearing Catholic.\n\nSo much for rejoicing.",
