  "description": "You've been warned. Yes, you, writing that high school paper with the assistance of ChatGPT. We see you! Beware!\n\nNo, don't beware your teacher finding out. It's just high school, who really cares. (We guess the teachers do, but they need to justify their measly salaries.) Beware that this is another step into... the singularity. Beware!\n\nYou know, the singularity, when technology is going to get so smart that humans will become unnecessary. To get there, we need to go through an intelligence explosion, a concept coined by British Jewish mathematician I. J. Good (he changed it from Gudak), who started his career by working with Alan Turing.\n\nAccording to Good, as man creates more and more intelligent machines, at some point an \"ultraintelligent\" machine, something that \"surpass all the intellectual activities of any man,\" will be made. That machine will make an ever more intelligent machine. That machine... you get the point. Man will no longer be necessary. Beware!\n\n\"Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control,\" Good concludes. Docile enough? Keep it under control? Oh boy...\n\nBeware!",
