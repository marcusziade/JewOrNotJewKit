  "description": "Ah, the Ma and Pa hardware store... A staple of American downtowns for generations.\n\nTo go in there, quizzically look at the shelves, for Pa to slowly get up from behind the counter, sigh (oh, those young whippersnappers!), and proceed to give you a lecture on differences between various types of screws, rich with history, fascinating to some...\n\nAnd to watch Ma, behind that ancient analog cash register, eager to punch up your purchase with her single index finger, pushing that bowl of lollypops towards you (surely you'd like a lollypop!), while inquiring about your day and that awful, awful weather we're having...\n\nAnd then to take one look at the prices, and make a run for it, heading to the nearest Home Depot, because, by golly, there is a reason the Ma and Pa hardware store is dying out.\n\nThanks, Home Depot founder Arthur Blank?",
