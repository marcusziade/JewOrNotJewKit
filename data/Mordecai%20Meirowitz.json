  "description": "Who doesn't love Wordle, the little word game that has\nTAKEN the\nWORLD by\nSTORM? We play\nEVERY\nday ourselves.\n\nBut Wordle isn't exactly unique.\nTHERE were similar\nGAMES that came before. In fact, its origins can be traced back to Mastermind, a children's\nBOARD game with different colored pegs. It was invented by a Romanian-born Israeli Jew, Mordecai Meirowitz, in 1970.\n\nAnd Mastermind itself can TRACE its origins back to\n\"BULLS\n and Cows\", a computer game written back in the 1960s. It used numbers, not letters or colors.\n\nTRULY, there are no original\nIDEAS left.\n\n.tb {\n color: #FFFFFF;\n font-weight: bold;\n width: 20px;\n height: 20px;\n text-align: center;\n font-size: 1rem;\n display: inline-block;\n margin: 1px;\n}\n.tc {\n background-color: #787C7E;\n}\n.tg {\n background-color: #6AAA64;\n}\n.ty {\n background-color: #C9B458;\n}\n.nb {\n white-space: nowrap;\n}",
