  "description": "We've been watching \"Silicon Valley\" (yes, for those who pay close attention, we're back to watching HBO), and we couldn't help but wonder if the main character, Richard, is Jewish.\n\n(Obviously, this has been our life for the past decade. We watch a TV show, we search for Jewish characters. It's our burden. We live with it.)\n\nIn any case, Richard is nerdy, frail, and fidgety. He is also brilliant, so obviously we had to consider him. And then, in one episode, an investor's (idiotic) girlfriend pointed a finger at Richard, with the words, \"Jew! With business!\" Unfortunately, the response was, \"No, Episcopalian.\"\n\nSo, with Richard no longer under consideration, but the James Wilson Law still in full effect, we had to turn to our second choice: the boorish, loquacious, obtuse, kimono-wearing Erlich Bachman. That first name is a mystery, but the last one can clearly be Jewish. And once you consider Erlich's Jewfro and the fact that actor T. J. Miller is Jewish (his mother was adopted by a Jewish family), then...\n\nA rare case when the character and actor share the same verdict and score!\n\nfunction loadPic(e) {\nif (e) {\n memorize();\n setImage('erlich_bachman');\n setTitle('Erlich Bachman');\n} else {\n remember();\n}\n}",
