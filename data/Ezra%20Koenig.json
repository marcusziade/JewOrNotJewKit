  "description": "We've made fun of Jewish food a lot over the years, for one very obvious reason:\n\nA lot of it is not very good.\n\nBlasphemous? Well, have you ever had gefilte fish? Point made.\n\nThere's one exception: lox. Lox is absolutely fantastic. Be it on a bagel, smeared with cream cheese, or straight out of the packet (we have never done that, mom!), it's absolutely amazing.\n\nWhich brings us to Ezra Koening, front man of indie rock band Vampire Weekend, who recently wrote a song about lox. Is Ezra Jewish? Do you have to ask?!\n\nYou know what, pastrami is delicious as well. And latkes. And knishes...\n\nLet's rephrase it: a lot of Jewish food is not very good... but some of it is great!",
