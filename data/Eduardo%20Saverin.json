  "description": "In November 2008, or seven(!) years ago, we profiled Mark Zuckerberg. The profile ends with the words, \"we're old\".\n\nA little background: we originally were going to write about the two Jewish co-founders of FaceBook, Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin. At the end, the decision was made to go with just one. And look how it worked out: Zuckerberg is Time's Man of the Year, subject of an Oscar-winning movie, beloved CEO, world's youngest super-billionaire, bla, bla, bla. Saverin? He might be awash in dough, but if not for that movie, people might not know who he is.\n\nSo why are bringing up that old profile? Well, it wasn't as much a discussion of Zuckerberg, but of Internet at the time, and how we don't get it (it being FaceBook, blogs, YouTube, podcasts) because \"we're old\". And that was seven years ago.\n\nNow? FaceBook has become passe. We've seen the rise of Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat. Cell phones became extensions of one's body. Google is omnipresent. Uber is replacing taxis. Amazon is promising delivery drones. Netflix is making TV shows. Kids would rather watch a video of someone playing video games than play those video games themselves. And we understand it all even less than we did seven years ago.\n\nDamn, we're old.",
