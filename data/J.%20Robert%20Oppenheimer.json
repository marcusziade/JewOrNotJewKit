  "description": "We're big fans of the Civilization series of games here at JONJ. For the unaware, you take control of a nation (say, England, the Aztecs â€” but never Germany!), build cities and armies, and conduct research in order to build a civilization that will stand the test of time! Or, at least that's what the box says, anyway. Mostly it's a chance to live out our world domination fantasies over a period of several sleepless nights. Lots of fun.\n\nIn any case, as you move later in the game, there's an option to take. Do you build the Manhattan Project? If you do, you can create an arsenal of nuclear weapons to terrorize the world and achieve your goal through force. But if you don't, the world could stay a safer, happier place, with no mushroom clouds rising above your enemy's cities, and you can gain a diplomatic victory.\n\nSo what do we do when faced with that decision? More often than not, we fire up our digital J. Robert Oppenheimer (digitally Jewish as well?) and get cranking on that polygonal atomic bomb.\n\nWhy? Because if we don't, who will? The Indians? The Dutch?... The Germans? Yeah, like we're gonna let that happen.",
