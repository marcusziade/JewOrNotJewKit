  "description": "For the last decade, our favorite hockey team, the New Jersey Devils, has tried to find a backup for Martin Brodeur.\n\nFor those not into hockey, Brodeur is the best goaltender in the history of the game. He holds pretty much every important NHL record and led the Devils to three Stanley Cups.\n\nBut a goaltender can't play every night, the job is too taxing. The Devils have been constantly trying to help Brodeur with relief, and it has never worked. Instead of steady understudies, they've gotten scrubs and sieves.\n\nUntil this season, that is. In came Cory Schneider, who is highly regarded throughout the league. And with Brodeur's career now winding down, and Schneider rumored to be Jewish...\n\nLet's check on that. No, not a Jew. The name has Swiss roots.\n\nSo, with Brodeur's career winding down, we can do much worse than Schneider. The last decade has proven that.",
