  "description": "Take horseradish. It's a staple of Jewish cuisine. Most Jews like horseradish.\n\nBut do they love horseradish? Doubtful. Sure, it does some things quite well, like complement herring. But would you ever eat the whole bottle? And would you put it on, oh, we don't know... baklava?\n\nSo... what about loving Israel? How is that for a transition?\n\nTake Israeli supermodels Bar Refaeli and Esti Ginzburg. There's quite a war of words going on between the two. Bar used a sham marriage to get out from serving in the Israeli Army. \"Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make?\", she says. Esti, on the other hand, swaps wearing bikinis and army fatigues. The lovely Miss Ginzburg has criticized her rival's choices. \"In order to contribute and help, in order to be part of the State,\" she says, \"enlisting is a duty, not a choice\".\n\nSo who is right? Who is wrong? And, more importantly, does Esti loving Israel make her a \"better\" Jew?\n\nNo, just like with horseradish, it doesn't. But it does get her a higher Jew Score.",
