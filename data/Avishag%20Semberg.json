  "description": "\"Good luck finding that elusive Jewish taekwondo medalist!\" â€” Jew or Not Jew, three days ago\n\nUhhhh... yeah... we literally just wrote that. It was in the Nathan Cohen profile, on the eve of the Tokyo Olympics, when we tried to find a Jewish Olympic medalist in every sport. We skipped a bunch, including taekwondo. It just seemed that improbable.\n\nWell, it's not anymore. On the first day of the Tokyo Games, 19-year-old Israeli Avishag (sometimes spelled Abishag) Semberg won her country's first ever taekwondo medal, a bronze. Hooray for Av(b)ishag! Hooray for taekwondoing Jews!\n\nBut what are we to do? Well, go back to the Nathan Cohen profile, add Semberg to our list of medalists, and replace the takewondo comment with...\n\nSynchronized swimming? Archery? Badminton? Highly unlikely we'll get a Jewish badminton medalist at Tokyo, but crazier things have happened...",
