  "description": "How do you tell the writer William Golding from the writer William Goldman? It's quite simple, really.\n\nGolding wrote \"Lord of the Flies\". You might have heard of that one. Pretty influential. Goldman wrote \"The Princess Bride\". You might have heard of that one. Pretty awesome.\n\nGolding was British. Goldman was American.\n\nGolding started with novels, dabbed with plays, but came back to novels. Goldman started with novels, dabbed with plays, and eventually settled on screenplays.\n\nGolding won the Nobel. Goldman won the Oscar. Two, actually.\n\nGolding was goyishe. In fact, \"Lord of the Flies\" can be seen as a Christian allegory. Goldman was Jewish. In fact, as previously discussed, \"The Princess Bride\" is incredibly Jewy.\n\nOf course, there is much more to Golding than \"Lord of the Flies\" and much more to Goldman than \"The Princess Bride\"... But we're here to clear up the confusion, not add to it.",
