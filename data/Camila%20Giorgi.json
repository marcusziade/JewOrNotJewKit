Italian tennis player?\n\nSince tennis has higher profile than most Olympic sports, that last one is not THAT obscure. Camila Giorgi has been on the WTA tour for over a decade, so she is somewhat known... if not that good. She's won only two titles in that span, and has reached the quarters of a major just once. (Alright, someone who has won two professional titles and has risen as high as #26 in the world is pretty good. Just not great.)\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, Camila exceeded expectations, upsetting three higher-ranked players to make it all the way to the quarterfinal. Alas, this is where she fell short.\n\nBut we're pretty sure Camila will do pretty well for herself, despite her lack of tennis superstardom.
