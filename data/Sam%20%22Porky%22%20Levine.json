  "description": "Who was Sam Levine?\nLevine was a hockey goaltender who played in the 1920s through 1940s.\n\nWhich teams did he play for?\nMost of his career was spent in the minors with the Seattle Eskimos, Minneapolis Millers, Kansas City Greyhounds, Tulsa Oilers...\n\nHe never played in the NHL?\nIt's hard to tell. Goaltending stats at the time were pretty sparse. He spent three years with the Detroit Cougars (now Red Wings) in the 20s and even appeared in team pictures. But there is no record of him playing a game... although teammates and family members insist that he had.\n\nSo why are you profiling an obscure minor leaguer?\nHis nickname was \"Porky\".\n\nHow did he get that nickname?\nHe was invited to a roast pork dinner, but refused to partake. The nickname stuck.\n\nSo... Porky was Jewish?\nThat's all, folks!",
