  "description": "If we told you that Peru has had at least four Jewish prime ministers, you would probably think it's a big deal. After all, Peru is not exactly known for its Jews.\n\nYou'd be wrong. A big deal it's not. Since the office was established  160 years ago, Peru has had... 153 prime ministers, and that's not counting repeat and interim ones. They've had 21 in this century alone. On that scale, four Jews doesn't exactly seem like that much.\n\nSo, whom do we choose to headline the profile? The options are:\n\nEfrain Goldenberg, served for 526 days in 1994-95\nPedro Pablo Kuczynski, served for 346 days in 2005-06\nYehude Simon, served for 270 days in 2008-09\nSalomon Lerner, served for 136 days in 2011\n\nWe're gonna go with Kuczynski, even though he is a practicing Catholic: other than his stint as PM, he is actually Peru's current president.\n\nWe'll see how long that lasts...",
