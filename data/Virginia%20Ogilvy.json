  "description": "Virginia Ogilvy, the Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II,  died recently. Well, the queen died first, so not sure what Virginia was during these last couple of years. Some old countess with no job, we guess.\n\nNot being privy to all the goings-on of British royalty, we obviously have no idea what a Lady of the Bedchamber does. It instantly makes us think of chamber pots, but it can't be that, can it?\n\nIt can! You know how you get up in the morning? Make your bed (alright, not all of you, CHILDREN!), brush your teeth, get dressed? All simple acts ingrained into your daily routine. (CHILDREN!!!) Well, those things are pretty complex for royals. For centuries, queens have been attended by women of the bedchamber, who help them do the hard stuff. Which, yes, includes using the chamber pot. And the Lady of the Bedchamber is in charge of all these lesser attendants. She tells them what to do... Perhaps what chamber pot to use on a Wednesday?\n\nWhich brings us back to Mrs. Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie. She was the first ever American Lady of the Bedchamber... and we bet the first ever Jewish one.",
