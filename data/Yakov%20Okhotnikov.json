So he and two friends made their way to the Mausoleum, and the rest is history. Well, it would be history if the Soviets-cum-Russians would ever mention the event. They don't.\n\nSo what happened to Okhotnikov? Surprisingly, initially, not much. Back in 1927, Stalin was not yet as all powerful as he would later become. The Trotskyist opposition was not yet defeated. So Okhotnikov was left alone... for five years, when he was arrested and sent to Siberia.
