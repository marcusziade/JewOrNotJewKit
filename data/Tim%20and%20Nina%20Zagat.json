  "description": "While some still long for the days when Zagat was \"the be-all end-all\" of urban eateries, it's clear that most feel the \"culinary king is dead\" or at least see the venerable establishment as \"yelping for life support\" in the Internet age.\n\nOnce \"the source for anything and everything eating\", Zagat fans point to the \"high class reviews by high class reviewers\" with its \"ingenious scoring system\" and insist that the Zagats and their famous book are \"something everyone should own,\" even if \"no one pronounces it right.\"\n\nBut rumors of \"epic douchebaggery\" on the part of the creators combined with an \"Internet plan that crapped out along with Compuserve and Pets.com\" has lead many to question \"is this maroon munching manual really worth the shelf space?\"    \n\nOne thing that cannot be debated â€” the Zagats, founders of the Zagat empire of reviews are \"totally, fully, completely Jewish.\" So \"at least they have that going for them.\"",
