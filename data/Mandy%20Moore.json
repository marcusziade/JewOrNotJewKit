  "description": "We like Mandy Moore. We don't necessarily like her music, or her acting... although she was decent on \"Entourage\" and deliciously evil in \"Saved!\". But... we like Mandy Moore. Let's just leave it at that.\n\nAnd apparently, Mandy Moore likes us. As she herself said, she likes \"good Jewish boys with a sense of humor\"! Well, that's the staff of JewOrNotJew.com right there!\n\nAnd what's more, Mandy is part Jewish herself. Sure, she sometimes wears a cross, but she no longer considers herself Catholic or Christian... that's a start.\n\nSo, in summary, Mandy seems like the perfect girl to bring home to...\n\nWhat's that, honey? We need to help you put the kid to bed?\n\nOh, dear.",
