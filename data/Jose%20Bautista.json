  "description": "As far as Spanish names go, it's hard to get more goyishe than \"Bautista\". After all, it references John the Baptist.  What could be worse... \"Jes\ufffds\"? \"Cristobal\"?\n\nSo it comes to great surprise that we welcome Dominican baseball player Jose Bautista into the fold. Pictured here wearing the cap of his first Major League team, the Baltimore Orioles, Bautista was a six-time all-star...\n\nWait, no. Not that Jose Bautista. The all-star who made his name with the Blue Jays and was nicknamed \"Joey Bats\" is not Jewish. This is a completely different (but also Dominican) Jose Bautista, who pitched nine years in the majors in the 1980s and 90s. (That haircut should have made it obvious.) And while the more famous Bautista led the American League in home runs twice, this one... retired as fifth on the all-time list of games pitched by Jewish players?\n\nWell, at least he is not named Jes\ufffds Cristobal!",
