  "description": "Every family has an uncle like our Uncle Larry.\n\nUncle Larry used to be cool. Every Passover Seder, he would show up with a new woman on his arm. And we couldn't wait to see who his \"friend\" is this year.\n\nThere was Amanda, the stewardess. Jennifer, the massage therapist. Amy, the... We forgot what Amy did, but she didn't look too shabby doing it.\n\nAnd then there was Samantha. What can we say about Samantha? We used to stay up all night, thinking about Samantha...\n\nThe years went by, and the women kept changing. And at some point, it stopped being cool, and started to become quite creepy. Every year, our mother would sigh as Uncle Larry introduced his new friend. Tammy, Karen, Laura... there was even a Christina. That was a weird Passover. And Uncle Larry is still going strong... only we are not looking forward to his visits as much as we used to.\n\nSo yes, Larry Brown has coached a lot of different basketball teams. And just like good old Uncle Larry, it used to be cool.\n\nBut now, it's just sad.",
