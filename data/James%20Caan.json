  "description": "If ItalianOrNotItalian.com was a real website, James Caan would be a prime candidate to appear. And we're pretty sure that his Kvell (or should we say, \"Orgoglio\") score would be through the roof: the man even received an Italian of the Year award!\n\nOne big problem. James Caan is NOT Italian. He's a Bronx Jew. A Playboy-mansion-living, hard-partying, punch-throwing, hard-drinking Bronx Jew. There is not a drop of Italian blood in him.\n\nClaiming James Caan to be Italian just because he played one in \"The Godfather\" would be just like claiming that Rosie O'Donnell is Jewish because she played one in \"Fiddler on the Roof\". And trust us, THIS website will never go there.",
