  "description": "Terry Pratchett's Discworld series is an absurd take on the fantasy genre, taking place on a flat (err... disc) world that is held up by four elephants that stand on a giant turtle that floats in space. It has such memorable characters such as the Orangutan librarian, who loves bananas and books, Carrot Ironfoundersson, the very tall human raised by dwarfs, and Cohen the Barbarian, once the world's greatest hero. Of course we had to find out about Cohen the Barbarian.\n\nApparently, Cohen's name is \"Ghenghiz Cohen\", as he is a pun on both Genghis Khan and Conan the Barbarian. We will assume that Cohen is his last name; so far so good. (Sure, not all real-world Cohens are Jewish, but come on.)\n\nBut here we hit a major snag; we're not sure if there are Jews in Discworld. There are a minimum of 53 religions, but the vast majority seem to be polytheistic. The one exception, Omnianism, is known for trying to convert heathens. Clearly, that's not Judaism.\n\nAs of this writing, we're two and a half books into the 41-tome saga... We'll make sure to update this verdict if we ever encounter a Dicsworld Jew.\n\n(Editor's update: Reading further, we learn about Discworld's golems, and, even more importantly, its kosher butchers. So, there are definitely some kind of Jews in Discworld...)",
