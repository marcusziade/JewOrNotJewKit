And while the Russians spent their time crying into yet another vodka bottle about the loss of communism, or buying another pair of knockoff jeans on the market, the Jews... the Jews were smarter than that.\n\nWell, most of the Jews left already. But those whose stayed were smart enough to grab what was out there. And now, some of the richest people in the world are these newly-made oligarchs... Russian Jews.\n\nTake Roman Abramovich, for one. Twenty years ago, he was just some Russian Jewish kid out of the army. Now, he is one of the richest people in the world.
