No, not Heyman.\n\nThey all played for the New York Knicks? No, not Johnson.\n\nThey all won professional championships? No, not Ewing.\n\nThen what?\n\nWould you believe they were all NCAA Final Four MVPs, as well as the top overall picks in the NBA Draft?\n\nSeriously, who says Jews can't play basketball? (No, no, they are not ALL Jewish. That's just silly.)",
