  "description": "When profiling comedian Louis C.K., we could chose to discuss his award-winning TV show, \"Louie\", which he writes, directs, edits, and acts in.\n\nOr, considering the nature of our website, we could discuss Louis' Jewish roots, for his paternal grandfather was a Hungarian Jew who emigrated to Mexico.\n\nBut we'd rather talk about this snippet from an interview:\n\nL.A. WEEKLY: Why are so many funny comics from Boston?\n\nLOUIS C.K.: Because Boston is a miserable place filled with drunks, losers and Jewish girls with big tits.\n\nNow, we've been to Boston. Some of us have even lived in Boston. We're not going to argue that it's a miserable place. We're not gonna argue about the drunks and losers. But Jewish girls with big tits?\n\nPerhaps we're not as familiar with Boston as we claim... And perhaps we should visit Boston more often?\n\n(Editor's update, November 9, 2017: Ugh. Boston might be a miserable place, but you, Louie, are a miserable man.)",
