  "description": "It's been a while since we dove into the treasure trove that is the Bible. Which story should we tell today?\n\nHow about Elisha? No, not Elijah, Elisha. He was actually Elijah's student and a master prophet himself. He also performed a bunch of miracles (purifying drinking water, raising the dead and what not): twice as many as his teacher. Take that, Elijah! Some miracle worker you are.\n\n(Before we get to the punchline, can we talk about raising the dead, just a bit? Perhaps these miracle workers were not exactly miracle workers, but just really good doctors. And purifying drinking water? You just boil it. Failing that, run it through a filter. Moving on.)\n\nAnyways, Elisha was wandering around Judea, as your average prophet should, when a group of young men (42 of them, to be exact) made fun of him. And what did our hero do? Did he cower? Did he insult them back? Did he simply ignore and carry on, like a normal adult would? No, no, no.\n\nElisha called on his friends: two bears, who promptly tore the 42 youths into pieces. The Bible, ladies and gentlemen!\n\nAnd what was the great insult that these unfortunate youths hurled upon Elisha?\n\nThey made fun of his baldness.\n\nfunction flip() { setImage('elisha_bears'); }",
