Today, it's a truly global event, with 32 teams, 64 games, and a month full of soccer. And that's not even counting the two years it takes to qualify.\n\nToday, the players are professionals with million-dollar contracts. Back then, they were amateurs. And one of those amateurs was Rudolf Wetzer.\n\nMost European nations decided to stay home to avoid the grueling travel to Uruguay; Romania was one of just three to make the trip. Wetzer was a starting forward on that team. On July 14, 1930, he helped his country to a 3:1 win over Peru. In their next game, Romania crashed out to to the hosts and eventual winners.\n\nWhat makes Wetzer's appearance special? He was the first Jew to play in the World Cup. He was also the only Jew to play in that inaugural tournament.\n\nWe wonder what someone like Wetzer would think of the game today...
