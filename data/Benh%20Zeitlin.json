  "description": "Back in 2012, Benh Zeitlin directed \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\". The film won a bunch of awards and earned four Oscar nominations, including one for Best Director. Zeitlin, who barely crossed 30, was one of the youngest nominees ever. Great things were expected from him. We were ready to profile the next great Jewish director.\n\nAnd then... nothing. The profile was put on hold, until either Zeitlin released a new movie, or we figured out why his perfectly Jewy name is saddled with a pesky \"h\".\n\nWell, it took eight years, but we got our answer. Zeitlin's real name is Benjamin. The \"h\" came from a typo on a letter he received that erroneously squished his middle initial H (for Harold) into Ben. Somehow, it stuck. (There is a side story about Zeitlin being in a high school band, where all members added a silent \"h\" to their name, but that sounds too dorky to be true.) \n\nOh, and his second movie is finally out: \"Wendy\", a retelling of the Peter Pan story.\n\nYou got your profile, BenH.",
