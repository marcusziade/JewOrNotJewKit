  "description": "We admit it. We've had a vendetta against Gary Bettman for over a decade.\n\nEver since he wanted to move our beloved New Jersey Devils to Nashville, even as the very same Devils were winning their first Stanley Cup, we did not like the guy.\n\nBut what could we do? In the mid 1990s, the NHL was doing well, the Devils stayed in Jersey, and Bettman was hailed for saving the league. And if this profile was done in the mid 1990s, we would have swallowed our hate and given Bettman a high K Score. He was a Jew in charge of a thriving sports league. No personal vendetta would have detracted from that.\n\nBut not so much now. The NHL is barely on the nation's radar screen, and Bettman often shoulders the blame. And we can say \"we told you so\", and revel in his failure, but sadly, we like hockey. Oh well. At least we can now give him a low K Score and not have to defend it.\n\nAnd that expansion Nashville franchise is a huge success, right?",
