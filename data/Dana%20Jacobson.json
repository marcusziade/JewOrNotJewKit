  "description": "\"Fuck Jesus.\"\n\nExcuse us, dear readers. We really don't have anything about Jesus per se, but any discussion of former ESPN anchor Dana Jacobson's Jewishness pretty much has to begin with these words. You see, thrse words were (allegedly) spoken by Jacobson and (allegedly) got her in hot water with her employer.\n\nSo why such vitrol from Miss Jacobson? Well, the remarks were (allegedly) spoken at a roast of ESPN radio hosts Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic. There, Jacobson (allegedly) chugged down a bottle of vodka and (allegedly) went off on Notre Dame, of which Golic is an alum. Jacobson is a graduate of the University of Michigan, Notre Dame's big rival. So the (alleged) remarks were not directed towards the (alleged) Son of G-d, but rather at Notre Dame, and its famed Touchdown Jesus symbol.\n\nWell, Miss Jacobson did keep her job... for four years, actually, but was let go earlier this year. (Allegedly), this dismissal had nothing to do with her remarks.\n\nAnd yes, she is Jewish (not allegedly).",
