  "description": "The Dutch play hockey, but they don't play hockey. Allow us to explain.\n\nWhen you think of hockey (provided you are not Dutch... or Spanish... or Indian... or Australian...) you think of ice, pucks, and zambonis. The Dutch (Spanish/Indians/Australians) think of carpet, balls, and short skirts. (Wait, that didn't sound right...) They think of a completely different game!\n\nWhat they call \"hockey\" is actually field hockey, a very popular sport in various parts of the world, especially in warmer climates. Heck, it's been in the Olympics since 1908. (The US, where field hockey is relegated to upper-class female high schools, has not exactly been successful.)\n\nAs for the Dutch? They are quite good at it. They've won a bunch of medals, and the ones that concern us most are the gold and bronze their women brought home in 1984 and 1988. One of the best players on that team was Carina Benninga, Jew. Her brother Marc was an Olympic medalist as well.\n\nThe Dutch, giving us Jewish Olympic medal-winning siblings! You won't see that for the other hockey...",
