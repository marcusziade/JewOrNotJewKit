  "description": "As a rule, we try not to watch too much TV on an airplane. The experience is not exactly enjoyable. There you are, trying to concentrate on the tiny screen in front of you, while attempting to ignore the snoring seatmate and the sideways glaces of the flight attendant... Yes, the seat belt is buckled!\n\nLong story short, this is how we ended up watching \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\". We figured, might as well â€” if it sucks, well, we're on an airplane, so it'll just kill time, but if it's good...\n\nIt turned out to be good. Not just good, but... marvelous. Very fun, and very Jewy. Oh, so Jewy. Except for... the cast?\n\nWe already covered it in the Rachel Brosnahan profile, but the real-life Mrs. Maisel is not Jewish. Neither are her parents (Tony Shalhoub often plays Jews, but he is not). At least the husband's family is: the flaccid Joel (Michael Zegen), and both his parents, including distinguished comic and dramatic actor Kevin Pollak, who gets to headline this profile. (Sorry, Zegen. Your character is just too lame.)\n\nSo now, we're waiting for Season 2... and we're not gonna wait for an airplane trip to watch it.",
