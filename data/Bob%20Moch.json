  "description": "In the 1936 Olympics, there were seven rowing events. Hosts Nazi Germany won five.\n\nAnd yet, we feel a lot of pride in the outcome of the largest event. In the eights, the Germans failed to win. The gold went to the Americans; or, to be more precise, to the University of Washington.\n\nThe US, instead of sending its eight best rowers, sent their best team. After the heavily favored Nazis jumped to an early lead, it looked like the Americans didn't have the chance.\n\nThe crowd got so loud, that the American coxswain, Bob Moch, found his megaphone rendered useless. So he started to signal the rhythm by banging on the boat's side. Stroke by stroke, the Americans caught up and took home the gold.\n\nAs for Moch, the team's leader? Just before the Olympics, he was revealed a family secret: his father was Jewish. You can only imagine what Moch had felt, going into the heart of Germany, trying to upend the Nazis in their game, on their water...\n\nBeaten by a Jew. Take that, Nazi Germany.",
