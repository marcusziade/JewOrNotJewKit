Because people don't just walk around all day breaking into song, that's why. The whole idea is just preposterous.\n\nOh no! We're being chased by the Nazis! What'll we do? I know, let's sing about it!\n\nRiiiiiight.\n\nWe understand musicals are supposed to be the definition of legitimate theater â€” the direct descendent of grand old opera. Whatever. Opera is beautiful and epic, the absolute pinnacle of culture with sweeping music, epic stories, and incredible stagecraft. Musicals are 20 minutes of singing about the surrey with the fringe on top.\n\nFuck that.\n\nSo Hammerstein may be the maestro behind Sound of Music, OOOOklahoma!, the King and I, etc. etc. etc.\n\nBut for something so doofy it's just kind of hard to care.",
