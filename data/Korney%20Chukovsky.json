  "description": "Russia, late 19th century. An offspring of a rich Jewish family, Emmanuil Levinson, has an affair with the family's maid, Ekaterina Korneychuk. Two children are born.\n\nEmmanuil's parents are against the marriage. First of all, the woman is not Jewish. Second of all, she is a maid. Bleh.\n\nSo the children are illegitimate. Emmanuil supports them financially, until he gets married (we assume to someone who is both Jewish and NOT a maid). Nikolay, his son, is expelled from school for being of \"low origin\" (read: illegitimate. Stupid Russians).\n\nNikolay grows up to be Korney Chukovsky, beloved children's author. His iconic characters resonate with Russian speakers to the day.\n\nBut throughout his life, Korney is tormented by the abandonment. As he gets older, he tries to reconcile with his father, but can't get over the past. Yet he is drawn to Jews: many of his friends are Jewish. So is his wife (well, born Jewish, but baptized. Stupid Russians).\n\nSo we are more than happy to offer Chukovsky a belated welcome back to the tribe. We understand if he would have felt otherwise.\n\nStupid Russians? In this case, sadly, stupid Jews...",
