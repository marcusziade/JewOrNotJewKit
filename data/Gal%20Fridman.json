  "description": "When we set out to create this website two years ago, we had three goals:\n\n1) To create a one-step place that can answer \"Is _____ Jewish?\" questions\n2) To kill some downtime at work\n3) To disprove the myth that there are no good Jewish athletes\n\nNot necessarily in that order.\n\nWell, not to pat ourselves on the back, we've succeeded on all counts. JONJ has nearly 300 profiles, work downtime now has a Jew-rific alternative, and our Athletes category is filled with a plethora of Jews.\n\nAnd some of those Jews are Olympic champions.\n\nSo, with the Beijing Olympics opening today, we're going to do something special next week. Each day we will profile a 2008 Olympian. Some of these will be champions. Some of these will be also-rans. All of these will be Jews.\n\nOh, Gal Fridman? Two-time medalist. A bronze in 1996, and a gold in 2004, Israel's only gold medal ever. In sailing. (Yes, Israel's LONE gold is in SAILING. Go Figure.) And, in case it's not obvious:",
