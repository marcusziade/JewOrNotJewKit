It's Jerry Haleva, the actor who portrays Hussein in movies, and he is in fact a Jew. Just look at his complete filmography:\n\nHot Shots! (1991) .... Saddam Hussein\nHot Shots! Part Deux (1993) .... Saddam Hussein\nThe Big Lebowski (1998) .... Saddam Hussein\nJane Austen's Mafia! (1998) .... Saddam Hussein\nThe First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest (2002) .... Hologram Saddam\nLive from Baghdad (2002) .... Saddam Hussein\n\nTalk about typecasting. We do wonder about a couple of things: how does someone who considers himself a Jewish activist reconcile playing Hussein, and how much of a stretch was it to play Hologram Saddam?\n\nWhat's next, we'll find out that Bobby Watson is Jewish? Feel free to look him up.",
