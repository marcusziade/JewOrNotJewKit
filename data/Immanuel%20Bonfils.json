  "description": "So here Jew or Not Jew goes again, giving a near-perfect score to someone no one has ever heard of!\n\nWell, that's part of the point. Perhaps more people should have heard of Immanuel Bonfils...\n\nWho is that picture of, anyway? Some medieval knight?\n\nThat's actually a 14th century French Jew. We searched far and wide, but couldn't find a picture of Bonfils himself.\n\nAha! You're really reaching into the obscurity pile!\n\nIt's really sad that Bonfils is so obscure. He was a medieval rabbi who invented one of the most important mathematical concepts of all time.\n\nMath? Who cares about math!\n\nBonfils invented decimal fractions.\n\nOh.\n\nYeah, decimals are kinda important, aren't they? In fact, Bonfils was 150 years ahead of his time. Decimal numbers did not become used in Europe until the 16th century.\n\nFine, fine. I still think you should write about more famous people.\n\nThen stop reading this profile!",
