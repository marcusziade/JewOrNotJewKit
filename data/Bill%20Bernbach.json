  "description": "There's not a lot of great TV out there. We like The Office and Survivor. Family Guy's usually solid. If Lost ever comes back on the air, that's a good time, too.\n\nBut there's one show that stands way above the rest: Mad Men, the wonderful program on AMC about an advertising agency in the 1960s.  \n\nThere's really no way to describe Mad Men except to say that it's amazing. Which you know if you've seen it. And if you haven't seen it, well, you need to go watch it. Go get the Season 1 DVD right now. It's cool. We can wait. Frankly, if you're not into Mad Men, we don't really want you reading our site, anyway.\n\nThere's really only one problem with Mad Men: Jews. There aren't any. \n\nWhat the hell? If there's an industry full of Jews that isn't banking or comedy or dentistry or comics, then it's advertising. Take ad bad boy Bill Bernbach. Back in those same 1960's ol' Bill was revolutionizing the industry. Taking it from the garish and insulting ads of the 1950s (\"Don't worry honey, you didn't burn the beer!\") to the hip, creative, inspiring work that's survived to this day (\"Think small\" to name one).\n\nOh sure, Mad Men mentioned him back in Season 1, but the father of modern advertising deserves more than just a shout out. Because, let's face it, there are going to be ads during our favorite shows. And we can't imagine how much more unwatchable they'd be if it wasn't for Bill Bernbach.",
