  "description": "There are a lot of statues in the United States. We like to honor our heroes. In Washington, DC, you can't walk five minutes without hitting someone's stationary likeness. We even have a monument prominently displayed on our currency.\n\nYet for all the good Jews have done to America throughout the years, it's pretty impossible to find a likeness of one of them. There is the new Albert Einstein memorial in DC, and... ummmm... yeah, we have nothing.\n\nWe had nothing, that is. Because this year, the good citizens of Milwaukee put up a statue of The Fonz, Arthur Fonzarelli, from TV's \"Happy Days\". And while the character was Italian, the actor who played him, Henry Winkler, is in fact a Jew.\n\nSo Einstein and the Fonz, that's a good start. But where do we go next? William Shatner as Captain Kirk? We might have to research Canadian Jewish statues for that one...",
