  "description": "We really like Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nThe erudite Argentine writer was simply brilliant, weaving words into amazing, transcendent, magical stories.\n\nAnd it turns out there is another reason beyond his writings to like him. For when Borges' Nazi-loving opponents tried to discredit him by saying that he was Jewish, he put out an essay entitled \"I, Jew\".\n\nWell, that title turned out to be a bit misleading. In that essay, Borges stated that he is not Jewish, and presented his actual genealogy. With that said, he added that he would have been proud to be Jew.\n\nAnd now we like him even more.",
