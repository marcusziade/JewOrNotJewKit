  "description": "Economics Nobel laureate and Turing Award recipient Herbert A. Simon is best known for his work in decision-making. Specifically, he came up with three stages of Rational Decision Making that laid the groundwork for his life's work. The stages are:\n\n\nIntelligence → Design → Choice\n\n\nMake a lot of sense, doesn't it? First we gather intelligence, then we design the solution, and then we choose the right path to follow... That's not always the case, however. Sometimes you rush and do design last.\n\n\nIntelligence → Choice → Design\n\n\nThis is a not ideal, but at least better than the complete waste of time that is starting with design...\n\n\nDesign → Intelligence → Choice\n\n\nIt can even get worse: \n\n\nChoice → Intelligence → Design\n\n\nThis is what happens when you get people involved who think they know everything. And then some skip stages:\n\n\nChoice → Intelligence → Design\n\n\nOomph. This is almost the pits.\n\n\nIntelligence → Design → Choice\n\n\nSigh. No, we're not referring to anything specific, why do you ask?\n\n.box {border:1px solid; display:inline; padding:3px}",
