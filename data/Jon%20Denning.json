  "description": "We don't get car racing here at JONJ. Frankly, if we wanted to look at things going in circles, making left turns, we'd watch clothes in our dryer. Come on t-shirt! Go get 'em underwear!\n\nAnd as far as car racing goes, we really don't get NASCAR. We bet we're not alone on this; it's hard to imagine any Jews watching a race from the back of their pickup truck, leaning against a gun rack, sipping a Bud. Seriously, how many Jewish NASCAR fans can there be out there? Two? Five?\n\nWell, there might not be many Jewish NASCAR fans, but there is at least one (we're betting only one) NASCAR driver. His name is Jon Denning, and no, we've never heard of him either. (As an aside, his name is homonymic to someone decisively un-Jewish we know from way back. And NASCAR's Denning comes from a town in New Jersey near where we grew up. This profile gets weirder by the minute.)\n\nSo perhaps we should embrace Denning as our ambassador to the sport. From what we've read, he definitely seems proud of his roots. So who knows, maybe we'll move to South Carolina, pop open a Bud, trade our sedans for pickups, join the NRA, and climb on the NASCAR bandwagon. And we'll thank Jon Denning for showing us the way.\n\nDon't worry, we're kidding with that last paragraph. Come on, it's NASCAR we're talking about.",
