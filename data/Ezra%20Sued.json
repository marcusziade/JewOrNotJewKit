  "description": "Copa America is one of soccer's most prestigious competitions, crowning the champion of South America. As of this writing, the 2021 edition is taking place in Brazil. (\"As of this writing\" is the key phrase here; already delayed a year due to COVID, we wouldn't bet against it being canceled between the time this is written and goes live.) And while no male Jew has ever won soccer's World Cup, we know of at least one who won the Copa: Ezra Sued of Argentina.\n\nOn the club level, Sued was a one-team player, playing for Buenos Aires' Racing for over a decade. For the national team, he was part of Argentina's 1946 and 1947 championship squads. He (and the rest of his countrymen) missed out the chance at a greater glory when Argentina pulled out of the 1950 World Cup, due to severing diplomatic relations with hosts, neighbors, and forever arch-rivals Brazil. \n\nJust a couple of things against Sued's prowess: apparently, he only played four minutes across the two Copas... and his nickname was \"El Turco\": \"The Turk\".\n\nSeriously, they couldn't have gone with \"El Judio\"?",
