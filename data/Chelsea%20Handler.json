  "description": "Through this whole Jay/Conan mess, we noticed that there aren't any Jewish late night talk show hosts (other than the the delightful Jon Stewart, of course).\n\nNot the aforementioned Jay Leno or Conan O'Brien. Not David Letterman or Jimmy Kimmel. Not Craig Ferguson, or Jimmy Fallon, or Carson Daly. Not the somewhat-recently-departed Tom Snyder or Craig Kilborn. Not even cable hosts (other than the the delightful Jon Stewart): Stephen Colbert, George Lopez, or Bill Maher (well, he doesn't really consider himself Jewish). Not even the cringe-inducing Chevy Chase or Magic Johnson (DUH! on that one).\n\nNope, all we got is the delightful Jon Stewart and... Chelsea Handler, the host of Chelsea Lately on E!. Chelsea is half Jewish and half Mormon, but was raised Jewish.\n\nSo how did Chelsea break through the goyim glass ceiling and not only got a late night talk show, but also kept it? Well, she's dating Ted Harbert, 20 years her senior, who, as the head of Comcast, runs E!.\n\nSo... ummm... well, we do have the delightful Jon Stewart, of course.",
