  "description": "John le Carre's \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" is called by some the greatest spy novel ever written. It's pretty darn good.\n\nOne of the key characters in the novel is Fiedler. He is a spy, the #2 man in East Germany's counter-intelligence, who might (or might not) be a double agent. He is Jewish.\n\nMarkus Wolf was the #2 man in the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, for over 30 years. In real life, not in some book. He was so elusive that he was known as \"the man without a face\". He was Jewish.\n\nIn fact, Wolf was a fan of le Carre's book, and was amazed by the accuracy that it portrayed East Germany's secret services.\n\nWhat makes all of this even stranger is that Fiedler's name in le Carre's early drafts was... Wolf.\n\nCoincidence?",
