  "description": "Every great director puts out at least one clunker in a career.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola gave us \"Jack\", in which Robin Williams plays a child. This happened.\n\nOliver Stone's supposedly-epic \"Alexander\" is terrible, and not just supposedly.\n\nEven Steven Spielberg is not immune: as much as we try to forget the  tiring, awful \"A.I.\", we can't.\n\nIvan Reitman, the man responsible for \"Stripes\" and \"Ghostbusters\"? He directed \"Junior\", where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a pregnant man. Yes, you probably forgot this happened. IT DID. And for those unfortunate souls who saw it, THERE IS NO WAY TO UNSEE IT.\n\nLet's just stick to \"Stripes\" and \"Ghostbusters\", okay?",
