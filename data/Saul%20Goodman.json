We get it, it's better than \"The Sopranos\", it's better than \"The Wire\", it's better than \"Mad Men\", it's better than \"Buffy, Vampire Slayer\"... It's the best show ever!\n\nSee, we missed the original airings, and now don't have the time to watch the... what is it? five? six seasons? We got families, and obligations, and... okay, we're just afraid we're gonna get sucked into the \"Breaking Bad\" vortex and won't be able to escape it until we watch the show in its entirety.\n\nPlease, please, please, stop asking us to profile Saul Goodman. We get it, he is a very important character on the show — he is even getting his own spinoff — and he has an interesting backstory, changing his name from McGill to appear more Jewish. We just feel that without watching the show, we won't be able to do Saul justice.\n\nPlease...\n\nAlright, fine, maybe we'll watch \"Breaking Bad\"...",
