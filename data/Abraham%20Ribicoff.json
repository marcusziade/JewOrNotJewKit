  "description": "In 1972, Democratic nominee for president, George McGovern, had to select a running mate. His first choices were Ed Muskey and Hubert Humphrey. Both declined.\n\nThird choice was Ted Kennedy, who said no, but suggested Tom Eagleton. McGovern didn't know Eagleton well, so he went to choice #5: Sargent Shriver. Shriver was visiting the USSR, so McGovern couldn't reach him, and went down the list to Walter Mondale. Mondale passed, but also recommended Eagleton. McGovern started to get anxious.\n\nSo he called his seventh choice: former Connecticut governor and current senator, Abraham Ribicoff. McGovern tried to sell his friend: he would be the first Jew on a major party ticket! Sadly, Ribicoff had to decline: he was getting married and would have no time for national politics. Yes, love intervened. Go figure.\n\nMcGovern went down the list, and somehow ended up with Eagleton anyway. Eagleton then withdrew from the ticket and Shriver ended up as the running mate, only for McGovern to get crushed by Richard Nixon. Not sure if having a Jew on the ticket would have helped.\n\nWe sincerely doubt it.",
