  "description": "When Formula 1 driver Rubens Barrichello added a small detail to his helmet (see on the right), Jewish racing fans immediately got excited. Could the Brazilian be one of their own? A rumor about a Jewish grandfather quickly sprung up.\n\nSo Barrichello had to address the star, and explained that people shouldn't read too much into it. He put it on top of his helmet... to get energy. From the sky. We're not even kidding. Oh, and he is not Jewish, he is Catholic. It's just a six-pointed star, stop asking!\n\nWell, soon after adding the star, Barrichello lost his place on his Formula 1 team, and was forced to move down to IndyCar. He lasted only a single year there, and now toils on the local Brazilian circuit.\n\nSo much for that mystical sky energy, right, Rubens?",
