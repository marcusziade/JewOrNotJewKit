  "description": "Hello there True Believers!\n\nIt's your friendly neighborhood Jew, Stan Lee — co-creator of such monumental mainstays as the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men, and Stripperella. OK, maybe not the last one.\n\nBut regardless, there's no doubting that Stan is an absolute comics titan, ushering in the Marvel era of comics in the 1960s with three-dimensional characters who, while 4 colors in appearance, were anything but in personality and scope. What's more, unlike many of his peers (OK, all of his peers) Stan's been recognized during his lifetime and is fairly well known in the mainstream media, a continual positive influence on the medium he helped succor. If there's such a thing as a superstar comics creator, Lee is it.\n\nSure he's done a pretty good job of screwing over his creative partners Steve Ditko (Spidey, not Jewish) and Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Jewish) by omission. And his mental faculties have been called into question in the last decade or so (see also, Stripperella). \n\nBut none of that changes the fact that every single person who is even peripherally involved with comics or the American icons contained within needs to get down on their knees and say a healthy thank you to one Amazing Jew — Stan Lee. \n\n'Nuff Said.",
