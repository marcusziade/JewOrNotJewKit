  "description": "In \"Highlander\", perhaps the greatest movie of the 1980s (Who's gonna argue with us? Alright, top 5), Sean Connery plays Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, an Egyptian (despite that Spanish name). Connery journeys to Scotland, where he serves as a personal Mr. Miyagi (oh, those 80s movies!) to Christopher Lambert, who plays the highlander (aha!) Connor MacLeod, joining the ranks of immortals. Swords clash. Queen sings. (Did we mention it was the 80s?)\n\n\nHere we are, born to be kings\nWe're the princes of the universe\n\n \nConnery, G-d bless him, doesn't even try for an accent. There he is, in his bearded glory, not even pretending to be Egyptian (or Spanish). He is supposedly a visitor to Scotland, and yet the most Scottish thing about it. Lambert, on the other hand, tries. Oh, does he try!\n\nLambert, who was born in New York, is actually French (the -t is silent). Back in his home country, he was well acclaimed, winning the Cesar for Best Actor (France's version of the Oscar) a year before \"Highlander\". It's been all downhill from there (we won't even mention \"Highlander 2\"...)\n\nAnd yet, do you realize how happy we were when we found out that Lambert is half Jewish? Queue Queen!\n\nHere we belong, fighting for survival\nWe've come to be the rulers of you all...",
