  "description": "Abraham Maslow is mostly known for his hierarchy of needs (physiological -\u003e safety -\u003e love -\u003e esteem -\u003e self-actualization), but let's talk about his hammer.\n\nNot his actual hammer, per se (it's hard to imagine a Jew being famous for carpentry, that one example two millennia ago be damned). \"Maslow's hammer\", also known as the \"law of the instrument\", states that \"it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail\". Basically, it means that once you know how to use a tool, you begin to apply it everywhere, even when it might not be the best option. Of course, the tool doesn't have to be physical.\n\nThat statement applies a lot to our daily lives, doesn't it? Be it at work or at home, it's always easier to rely on tried and true methods, and opposed to learning something new. That Maslow had a point...\n\nFor instance, when we want to profile a scientist for this website, we usually read up their bio, find one specific part of their work to latch on to, and expand it to, say, five paragraphs...\n\nNever forgetting to mention that they are Jewish!",
