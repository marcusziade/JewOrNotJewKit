  "description": "The 1957 NCAA basketball championship game is considered an all-time classic. The University of North Carolina beat the University of Kansas in unheard-of triple overtime, 54:53. It was UNC's first championship ever, starting them on their way to becoming one of the most successful collegiate programs.\n\nThe best player on UNC was Lennie Rosenbluth, who was named National Player of the Year. He did not win tournament MVP, however. Despite being on the losing side, that honor went to a player from Kansas... Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nRosenbluth's career in the NBA did not exactly pan out. He played two uneventful seasons for the then-Philadelphia Warriors, before retiring. The man who followed him on the Warriors, and shattered all basketball records? Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nHeck, even this very website profiled the obviously goyishe Chamberlain six years prior to Rosenbluth.\n\nIt's about time Lennie got his due?",
