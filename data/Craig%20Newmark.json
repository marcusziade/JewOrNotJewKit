  "description": "\"Dad, can you help me with my history homework?\"\n\nI reluctantly turned off the TV Wall. The New York Knicks were beating the Beijing Nike Pandas 281-274.\n\n\"Dad, what are newspapers?\"\n\n\"Newspapers?... Imagine a bunch of large sheets of paper delivered to your front door every morning. And on those sheets, you could read yesterday's news.\"\n\n\"Why would anyone want to read yesterday's news?\"\n\n\"Well, before the Internet...\"\n\n\"BEFORE the Internet?\"\n\n\"Yeah, in the dark days before the Internet, that was the only way to read the news.\"\n\n\"What about Almighty Google?\"\n\n\"There was no Google.\"\n\n\"No Almighty Google? How did people get things done?\"\n\n\"Beats me.\"\n\n\"So why are there no more newspapers?\"\n\n\"Well, back in the day, newspapers looked down on the Internet. The Internet grew, people wanted information faster and cheaper, but newspapers never adjusted. And once Craig Newmark started Craigslist, where people could post ads for free, newspapers stopped making money from classified ads. So one after one, they went bankrupt.\"\n\n\"I know Craigslist! Dylan's uncle is on it every Friday night, looking for new robo-friends.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's Craiglist.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I think I got it.\"\n\n\"Oh. And Craig was Jewish.\"\n\n\"Jewish? Like President Finkelstein?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"",
