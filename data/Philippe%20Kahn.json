  "description": "With technology moving as fast as it does, it's easy to dismiss every new gadget that comes around. For who has the time to look at a what's-it when there is a brand new that-thing around the corner, and it has lights and everything! When it comes to technology, we're like a nation of toddlers.\n\nSo, we admit it, we dismissed the camera phone the first time we saw it. It seemed useless, and clunky, and the picture quality was terrible, and who the hell would ever want to use that?\n\nWell, the world, apparently. In a few short years, camera phones are ubiquitous. From a grandmother snapping shots of her flowerbed to a congressman snapping shots of his private parts, it's hard to find someone who doesn't use one.\n\nAnd who was the first to stick a camera on a cell phone? Philippe Kahn, a French Jew. The first picture ever taken was that of his newborn daughter. \n\nAs useful as the camera phone proved to be, that one beat most that followed, we give you that.",
