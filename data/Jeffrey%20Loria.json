  "description": "Let's talk about Godwin's Law.\n\nGodwin's Law states that the longer an Internet conversation continues, the more likely it is to include a comparison of the subject to Hitler (or the Holocaust).\n\nSo, for instance, no matter what the discussion, you will eventually find someone saying something along the lines of \"You/He/They did WHAT?! They're worse than HITLER!\"\n\nWhich is ludicrous. Hitler personally instigated the murder of millions of people. Millions. No one is worse than Hitler. OK, maybe Stalin. But that's it. Seriously. Pol Pot will have to settle for #2.\n\nSo Jeffrey Loria is a despicable human being who has run two major league franchises into the ground. (And then salted the earth on which they stood. Then took a massive doody over that. Then laughed.) He is a criminal, bilking the state government of Florida to squeeze its residents for millions of dollars that he then pocketed to supplant his own already immense income. He is a giant weeping, cancerous tumor on all professional sports, wreaking indiscriminate damage on fans like the mutant bastard child of Frank McCourt, Donald Sterling, and Fred Wilpon.\n\nJeffrey Loria is all those things and more. But he's not worse than Hitler. He's just not.\n\nHoly fuck does he come close, though.",
