  "description": "During his long career, Hetry Lewites made numerous contributions to Nicaragua.\n\nLewites, a son of Polish Jewish immigrant, started out in the 1970s, smuggling arms to the Sandanistas. When Daniel Ortega rose to power in the 1980s, Lewites became Minister of Tourism. (From dealing arms to welcoming tourists? Makes sense...)\n\nIn 2000, Lewites became the mayor of Nicaragua's capital, Managua. And in 2006, he decided to run for president, against former pal Ortega. Unfortunately for Lewites, that ended in his very mysterious death. Ortega might or might not have been involved (oh, who are we kidding!), but that was the end of Lewites' contributions to Nicaragua.\n\nWe forgot to mention his most important one. Lewites opened Nicaragua's first amusement park, which he dubbed Hertylandia. That's right, he named it after himself. Nicaragua's first (and only) amusement park is named after an arm-dealing, possibly poisoned, Jew.\n\nSay what you want about the rest of his contributions, but that's pretty awesome.",
