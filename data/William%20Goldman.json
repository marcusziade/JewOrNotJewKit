  "description": "We were watching \"The Princess Bride\" the other night for the 53rd time (give a take a couple), and realized: this movie is incredibly, incredibly Jewish. And we're not even talking about the previously-profiled character of Miracle Max. Observe:\n\nThe movie was directed by Rob Reiner, Jew. Produced by Reiner, Andrew Scheinman, and Norman Lear, all Jews. Written by William Goldman, Jew, based on his own book (read the book if you have the chance, it's terrific). Music by Mark Knopfler, Jew.\n\nThe actors? Well, we have a few token goyim in there: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright (because we will never, ever have a Hollywood Jewish princess), Chris Sarandon, and the late, great Andre the Giant. But the rest of the main cast?\n\nPeter Falk (Grandfather): Jew. Fred Savage (Grandson): Jew. Mandy Patinkin (Inigo Montoya): Jew. Wallace Shawn (Vizzini): Jew. Christopher Guest (Count Rugen): Jew. Carol Kane (I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!): Jew. Billy Crystal: Do you have to ask?\n\nSo, at the end, we just have to figure out who gets to headline this incredibly Jewish profile. Why not the man who created the whole thing in the first place?\n\nAnd, seriously, fans of the movie, read the book. You won't regret it.",
