Swinger.\n\nWhat did you expect? A discussion of Kissinger's tenure as Secretary of State? The controversy over his Nobel Peace Prize? The millions of people he had a hand in killing? (Did we say the quiet part out loud?) Then you don't know our website.\n\nFor in the 70s, the square-jawed, square-shouldered Kissinger was not a square at all. He was a happening swinger, frequenting Hollywood parties and collecting actresses/models by the boatload: Samantha Eggar, Marlo Thomas, Jill St. John...\n\nSounds unbelievable, right? Henry Kissinger, a playboy? But don't take it from us, take it from the man himself. \"It's astonishing, you know,\" he said at the time. \"These starlets I go out with aren't even sexy.\"\n\nOh, Henry, oh you horndog.\n\nYea!",
