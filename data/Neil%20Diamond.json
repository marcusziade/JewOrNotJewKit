  "description": "Neil Diamond is known as the Jewish Elvis. He is one of the best-selling artists of all time. He is supposed to be an observant Jew who attends synagogue \"on the serious holidays\". So why can't he crack double digits on his Jew Score?\n\nIt has everything to do with his Christmas Album. That's right, a supposed observant Jew released something called \"The Christmas Album\". How does that make any sense? Why did you do that, Neil?\n\nWas it for your love of Christmas? Unlikely. Admit it, you did it for the money. The money you can make off the goyim, who are more than happy to celebrate their great holiday by giving you $15 of their hard-earned dollars. Then, another $15 for \"The Christmas Album, Volume 2\". That's right, there was a Volume 2. And did you stop there? No, no, no. \"A Cherry Cherry Christmas\". Three Christmas albums. Three!\n\nSorry, Neil. You can take your Christmas albums and shove them. The last thing we need is a sell-out, no matter how observant he claims to be. Besides, Elvis' reverence for Jews is well documented. Why do we need to settle for a lesser, even if Jewish, version?",
