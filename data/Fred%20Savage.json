  "description": "You had us all fooled, Kevin Arnold. Here you were, the prototypical American kid, with your \"Wonder Years\", your Christmas parties, your blond family, and your stereotypical Jewish friend. You were the personification of American innocence, of American youth, of American suburbia. And we were all so fooled.\n\nFor who could have guessed that between the WASPy Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) and the oh-so-Jewish Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano), it was Savage who is a bigger Jew. Saviano, as we discussed in the Marilyn Manson profile (of all places), is actually only half-Jewish, while Savage attended temple, was bar mitzvahed, and participated in Hillel at college. So much for WASPiness.\n\nJust another example why you can't trust everything you see in sitcoms. What's next, we're gonna find out Alyssa Milano is Jewish? Hmmmm. We wouldn't mind that at all...",
