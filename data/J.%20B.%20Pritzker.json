  "description": "Illinois politicians are notoriously corrupt. From Senator William Lorimer (kicked out of the Senate for buying votes) to governor Len Small (embezzled a million dollars, pardoned notorious criminals) to House Speaker Dennis Hassert (not only a crook, but also a child molester) to governor Rod Blagojevic (was sent to jail for...

He is one of the wealthiest politicians in US history; his family owns the Hyatt hotel chain. With Pritzker's wealth estimated at 3.5 billion, perhaps he doesn't need the under-the-table money that doomed so many of his predecessors?

After all, we're from New Jersey...",
