  "description": "Today, our quest to profile a Jew from every country in the world takes us to North Macedonia. Yes, North Macedonia is now a country!\n\n\"Now\" is the key word here. After Yugoslavia broke into various states in the early 1990s, one of those was Macedonia. However, Southern neighbors Greece have their own Macedonia, a historical region that was once the homeland of Alexander the Great. So Greece and the new Macedonia staged a decades-long argument, which was just resolved last year. Greece obviously won: the former Yugoslav republic is now North Macedonia, while the Greek region kept its name. (Does this make North Macedonia the West Virginia of Europe? Discuss.)\n\nBrief geographical lesson aside, there are not many Jews in Macedonia, North or otherwise. But you know who Macedonia has plenty of? The Romani, Europe's other favorite persecuted group. One of the most prominent was singer Esma Redzepova, known as \"The Queen of the Gypsies\". (We know that word is not exactly in favor, but that's how she called herself. Who are we to argue?) Of course, this is not RomaniOrNotRomani.com, so let's mention that Redzepova is a quarter Jewish, and mark North Macedonia on our map!\n\nBefore we conclude, we must mention Redzepova's biggest contribution to western culture: her song appears on the soundtrack of that pinnacle of ethnic diversity... \"Borat\".\n\nAre we sure she's only a quarter Jewish?",
