  "description": "There are four new sports in the Tokyo Olympics: Karate. Skateboarding. Surfing. Sport Climbing. \n\nKarate makes sense, especially since taekwondo and judo are already included. Being hosted by Japan doesn't hurt.\n\nSkateboarding and surfing we gotta group together. Clearly, the Olympics are trying to grab the young audience here. And since snowboard is already part of the Winter Games, so why not add its summer equivalents?\n\nHeck, we even got a horse in the race! Well, on a board, that is, as Anat Lelior of Israel qualified as the top-ranked surfer from all of Europe! (Once again, Israel benefits from being shifted out West? Take that, Estonia!) Now, Lelior did not medal, but still, hooray for surfing in the Olympics!\n\nNow sports climbing? Eh... What the hell is sports climbing?",
