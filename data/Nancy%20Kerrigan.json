  "description": "When we found out that ESPN is doing a documentary on figure skating, we just had to watch. Go figure.\n\nOf course, it wasn't just any figure skating. The film told the story of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. We remember the time when America — no, the world — was gripped by two rival figure skaters, one of whom might — might — have planned an attack on the other one.\n\nSo what did we learn about Tonya? We learned that she had a very rough childhood and marriage. We learned that she still claims her innocence, while others remain convinced she is at fault. We learned that figure skating judges are manipulative, flaky, and corrupt. We learned that the men hired by Tonya's husband to attack Nancy were the dumbest bunch imaginable. We learned that Tonya is still a sore loser.\n\nWhat did we learn about Nancy? Well, she declined to take part in the documentary, favoring a competing film on NBC. But we did learn that she married her manager, a Jewish man 20 years her senior.\n\nWe also learned that all these years later, the Tonya and Nancy story is still a gripping subject. Go figure.",
