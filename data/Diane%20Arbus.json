  "description": "Back in the olden days, being an artist used to mean something. It was a craft that required time, dedication, and skill. Recreating a beautiful landscape meant sitting hours upon end, working just to create the correct color green, let alone actually getting that green to look exactly like a tree on the shores of the Seine on a cool August morning.\n\nThen the camera came and all you had to do was push a button whilst keeping your thumb out of the lens.\n\nThis is art? The same crap that litters Tanta Schmata's photo albums hangs on the wall at the Met? Please. Put a little effort in, would you please? Even the guy who paints the big black square still has to spend a few days working on the darned thing. You could take an award winning photo by accident. In fact, looking at \"genius\" photography, it sure looks like a bunch of them were.\n\nSo, Diane Arbus took pictures of weirdos and freaks. Big whoop. If that's all it takes to make art, then Tanta Schmata's pictures of last year's Thanksgiving should be hanging in MOMA.",
