  "description": "Some of our readers have asked us to profile Zac Efron, the star of\n\"High School Musical\". And who are we to deny our loyal readers?\n\nSo, Zac Efron. Zac. Efron...  Well, his name is Zac and that's.... Ummmmm. \n\nWe got nothing.\n\nWe'd ask our intern, the young woman who profiled Zac's co-star Ashley Tisdale, but she's since left us for a staff position at the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd we're not watching High School Musical. So that's out. You know what? Whatever happened to good high school movies? High school movies with plots? Give us \"Karate Kid\". Give us \"Teen Wolf\". Give us...\n\nOops, showing our age. In any case, there's one thing the new generation has on us. For as much as we love to reminisce about campy 80s flicks, their stars — Ralph Macchio or Michael J. Fox or John Cusack — were not Jewish. Meanwhile, singing, dancing, teenage girl-swooning Zac does not practice any religion, but does have a Jewish grandparent.\n\nWe hope that satisfies our readers. Hashem knows it's more than enough for us.",
