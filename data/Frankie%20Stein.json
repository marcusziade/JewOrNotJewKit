  "description": "As we discussed many, many years ago, Frankenstein (err... Frankenstein's monster) is not Jewish, specifically on the count of him not having a mother. But what about his daughter, Frankie Stein? Wait, what? Who?\n\nApparently, Frankie is a character on something called \"Monster High\", an animated franchise based on a line of dolls. There's Draculaura, Clawdeen Wolf... You know, we really don't want to delve too much into it. Frankie is one of the main characters. She is a frankenmoster. She goes to high school. Her last name is Stein. Wait, did we just say she is Frankenstein's daughter? We guess we have to delve into it...\n\nApprently, Frankie's father is named Viktor Stein, and her mother is Viveka... Wait, she has a mother? Do frankenmonsters... copulate?\n\nYou know, we're not gonna try to find an answer to that. If you want to scrutinize the sexual lives of frankenmonsters, go right ahead. We're just trying to figure out if Frankie Stein is Jewish. Apparently, her parents come from Germany. Which doesn't preclude them from being Jewish, but, you know.\n\nSo how do we figure this out? Do we have to watch the countless episodes of \"Monster High\" in its multiple iterations (there is even a live action movie) to find any hint of Jewishness? Of course not. We've delved too deep into this already.",
