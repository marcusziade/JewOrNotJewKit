  "description": "This site is full of folks who, at one point or another, changed their names to sound less Jewish. Whether it was to hide their identity from a less than kosher-friendly world or to save us all from the horror of Lifshitz jeans, many the tribe member has altered their appellation in order to appear more marketable.\n\nGoldenberg's, makers of the Peanut Chew — famed treat of the Eastern seaboard and former World War I ration — certainly weren't ashamed of their Hebrew history. They slapped the name right on the wrapper. \n\nHowever, times change. The viability of a company with one product is no longer assured. So in 2003 the Goldenberg's sold their Peanutty Chewiness to Just Born, Inc., a candy company best known for (ironically) Easter Peeps. The folks over at JBI (as we imagine they must call themselves), did what any company would — they removed the Goldenberg's name! And changed the packaging! And altered the formulation...\n\nJews (and vegans, apparently) were upset. This was our candy and these people (Jewish people, apparently, but still) were goy-ing it up in a transparent attempt to be more mainstream. But a funny thing happened on the way to the land of Christian-y chocolate: sales of the Peanut Chews plummeted. \n\nThe JBI peeps (get it, cause they make peeps? oh whatever...) saw the writing on the (wailing) wall, restored the original packaging and, most importantly, put the Goldenberg's name back on the bar. Yes, it's that rare occurrence when a name must be changed to sound more Jewish. And yes, sales have responded accordingly. \n\nPeanut Jews, indeed.",
