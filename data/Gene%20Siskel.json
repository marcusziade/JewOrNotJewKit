  "description": "The history of \"At the Movies\", the television program that reviews films:\n\nSiskel and Ebert: One Jew, one gentile. The dream team of film criticism. Thumbs are raised. Thumbs are lowered. Definitely watchable.\n\nEbert and Roeper: Two gentiles. Pretty watchable.\n\nRoeper and whoever replaced Ebert the given week: One gentile, the other varies. Sometimes watchable.\n\nLyons and Mankiewicz: Who? Yes, Lyons and Mankiewicz. That's who is hosting \"At the Movies\" now. Two Jewish guys named Ben. Completely, utterly unwatchable.\n\nSo is there a formula here? We would think that if one Jew is good, two would be better... but that's clearly not the case.\n\nWell, there doesn't have to be a formula. It's just easier to say that it all went downhill after Siskel.",
