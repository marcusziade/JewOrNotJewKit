  "description": "When he was young, Robert Barany wanted to work for Sigmund Freud. Freud would have none of it, dismissing the aspirant for being \"too abnormal\".\n\nBarany recovered from the rejection. His research into physiology of the inner ear allowed surgery for vestibular diseases. In 1914, he was awarded the Nobel for Medicine.\n\nAs a Nobel winner, Barany was allowed to nominate others for the honor. (This after he had to be rescued from a Russian POW camp; Barany volunteered as a surgeon in the German army during World War I.) His submission?\n\nSigmund Freud.\n\nThe Nobel Committee did not follow Barany's nomination, and Freud was never honored.\n\nSo, why did Barany forgive that initial dismissal? Well, Freud himself was a walking abnormality. Perhaps him calling someone else abnormal could be considered a compliment?",
