  "description": "The great Jewish quarterbacking messiah stands 6'4\", 210 lbs, with a mop of blond hair.\n\nThe great Jewish quarterbacking messiah has a Quaker mother and went to a Catholic high school.\n\nThe great Jewish quarterbacking messiah is a self-proclaimed atheist.\n\nDon't worry, Jewish football fans! We're not letting this one get away. Atheist, shmatheist, he was bar mitzvahed, so: Jew!\n\nThe great Jewish quarterbacking messiah has not even played a full college season at UCLA.\n\nYeah, perhaps we should wait a bit before proclaiming Josh Rosen the great Jewish quarterbacking messiah...\n\n(Editor's update, 2018: Now a first-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals. Messiah?)\n\n(Editor's update, 2019: Traded to Miami after just one season. Probably not the Messiah...)\n\n(Editor's update, 2022: On his sixth team in five years. Nope!)",
