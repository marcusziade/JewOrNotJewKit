  "description": "Sigmund Freud might have been the father of psychoanalysis, but he was also a the father of architect Ernst Freud. In turn, Ernst was the father of Lucian Freud, one of Britain's most acclaimed artists of the 20th century. According to the all-knowing Wikipedia, his works \"are noted for their psychological penetration\". Talk about Freudian.\n\nAs for Lucian Freud, he was the father of... Oh boy. He was involved in a gay love triangle, which seems unlikely to produce offspring, and also married the niece of a woman with which he had an affair. That marriage produced two children. Then there was another marriage, to a Guinness heiress, and countless dalliances, relationships, and affairs, which produced, among others, poet Annie Freud, sculptor Jane Freud, painter Paul Freud, fashion designer Bella Freud, and novelist Esther Freud, all relatively accomplished in their own right.\n\nAll in all, Lucian fathered somewhere between fourteen and forty children.\n\nNow that's Freudian!",
