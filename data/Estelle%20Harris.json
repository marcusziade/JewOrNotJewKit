  "description": "Have you noticed that all of the sudden, Betty White is omnipresent? Helped by an Internet campaign, she has become America's favorite octogenarian: cameos, commercials, SNL, even her own TV show...\n\nAnd that's all fine and good. Nothing against Betty White. But what about Estelle Harris?\n\nBetty was on Golden Girls. Estelle was on Seinfeld. Sure, there is a portion of population that prefers the former to the latter, but... Golden Girls? Seinfeld? Come on. It's not even close. And was she ever funny! One of the greatest supporting characters in television history.\n\nYes, Estelle did voice Mrs. Potato Head in the Toy Story movies... That might have been a start, but they are not making those anymore. So while Betty is racking in the accolades, Estelle is wallowing in animated anonymity...\n\nWake up, Internet! Rise up like you did for Betty! Put Estelle Harris back into the spotlight! Isn't America ready for its own Jewish grandmother?\n\nOh, right, JEWISH grandmother. On second thought... maybe not.",
