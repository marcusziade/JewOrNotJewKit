  "description": "Have you heard about the Jewish Jordan?\n\nNo, not a previously unknown Hasidic section of Amman. Rather, a basketball player the media dubbed \"The Jewish Jordan\"; a high schooler named Tamir Goodman who supposedly could do it all on the court and wore a yarmulke off it.\n\nBut this profile is not about him, either. For Tamir couldn't hack it in college and was banished to the Israeli second division. Jewish Jordan? More like Jewish Benjamin, as in Benoit Benjamin. Feel free to look him up.\n\nNo, this profile is about Jordan Farmar, another Jewish basketball player, who, unlike Goodman, can actually play. Farmar started at UCLA, and is now an important player on the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nTo be fair, Farmar is not 100% Jewish. His father is black, but since he was raised by his mother and his Israeli stepfather, was bar mitzvahed, and considers himself a Jew, he more than makes the cut.\n\nSo there you go, our Jewish Jordan. He'll probably never play on the original Jordan's level, but at least he's got the name down.",
