  "description": "The Stooges have always been sold as part of the mainstream, red-blooded American male culture. So it's not surprising that those of us at JONJ have little interest in them. After all, we are neither mainstream nor pure blooded American (though some of us are distinctly male).\n\nBut what WOULD surprise the afore-mentioned mainstream, red-blooded American males about their oh-so-beloved Stooges? All Jews. \n\nJust think, these three schlemiels who tear at each others' eyes, engage in juvenile schadenfraude, and perform pratfalls for our supposed entertainment are Jews. Famous Jews. Popular Jews. Beloved Jews.\n\nSo what if we don't find them to be funny Jews? The rest of the country seems to. And we're nothing if not willing to bow to popular opinion. Even if it's about three meshuggenahs named Larry, Moe and Curly.\n\nAnd yes, even Shemp.\n\nNyuk, nyuk, nyuk",
