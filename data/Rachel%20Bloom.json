  "description": "Fuck me, Ray Bradbury.\n\nRachel Bloom might be a big star now, winning all kinds of fans and awards as the titular \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\", but her career started with those four words.\n\n\"Fuck me, Ray Bradbury\" is the title of Bloom's Youtube video that helped skyrocket her to fame. It tells of her lust for, natch, Ray Bradbury. Just go to Youtube and watch it. We'll wait.\n\nFantastic in many ways, isn't it? Yeah, we thought so too.\n\nNow, as much as we love Ray Bradbury, we can't exactly share Rachel's... ahem... love for Ray Bradbury.\n\nNow, on the other hand, Rachel herself is apparently very Jewish, both in real life and on her TV show...\n\nFuck me, Rachel Bloom?\n\nOh-oh. The wife is not gonna read this, is she?",
