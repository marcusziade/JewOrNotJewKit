  "description": "Say you're visiting Cleveland... Well, for that you need a reason to visit Cleveland. Perhaps you're a big fan of bratwurst and urban decay? Then you're obviously going to visit the famed Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Seriously, there is not much else to do in Cleveland.\n\nAnd once you visit that Hall of Fame, you will marvel at all the rock luminaries, including 2022 inductees, which include Dolly Parton! Wait, what the hell?\n\nDolly Parton? Now, Miss Parton is a very lovely woman with a very very large... following, who's had a tremendous career in COUNTRY music! In what world is country considered rock? Isn't there a COUNTRY Music Hall of Fame? Yes, there is, in Nashville! Miss Parton was inducted all the way back in 1999.\n\nAnyway, all this Parton mishegas has distracted from the current inductees, which count Eminem, Duran Duran, Lionel Richie, and Carly Simon among them. Take Simon, for instance: numerous hit records in the 1970s, with #1 singles and albums to her name. She is a true rock legend (and Jewish on her father's side to boot!). And yet, we spent the majority of her profile talking about the ridiculousness of Dolly Parton... And this is nothing against Dolly Parton!\n\nWho's next year's inductee, Chris Gaines?",
