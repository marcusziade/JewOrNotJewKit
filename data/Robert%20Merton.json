  "description": "Stigler's law of eponymy, as stated by Stephen Stigler, claims that discoveries are never named after their real discoverer. There are many examples, including:\n\n Halley's comet, named after Edmond Halley, but discovered many centuries prior\n Pythagorean theorem, known to Babylonian mathematicians long before Pythagoras\n Venn diagrams, proposed by Christian Weise and Leonhard Euler, but \npopularized by John Venn\n Euler's number, the constant discovered by Jacob Bernoulli, but named after Euler (payback!!!)\n Occam's razor, named after William of Ockham, but formulated long before his time (clearly, not the simplest solution here...)\n Stiegler's law, which, according to Stigler himself, was originally discovered by sociologist Robert K. Merton!",
