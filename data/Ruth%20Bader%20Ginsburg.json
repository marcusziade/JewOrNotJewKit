  "description": "When we started with website, we had to pick someone for the perfect score. That someone was Mel Brooks â€” a terrific choice, if we say so ourselves. So Brooks was going to be the 15, and everyone else would have to fall somewhere beneath.\n\nAnd yet, when it came time to profile Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that notion of the solitary perfect score went out of the window.\n\nNot only is Ginsburg Jewish inside and out (and proud to be so), it is us who couldn't be prouder to have her in the tribe. Especially since she stands up to Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on a daily basis.\n\nSo move over a bit, Mr. Brooks. You are still the center of our Jew or Not Jew universe, but there's no reason to deny this worthy candidate her own space at the top.",
