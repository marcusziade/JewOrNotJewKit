  "description": "When someone new comes to our website, the first category they click on is almost always Sociopaths. (And never Artists. Duh.)\n\nSociopaths, of course, is a hodgepodge of, well, criminals and crazy people. They share one thing in common: a low K Score. Nope, nothing to kvell about in the Sociopaths category...\n\nWhich brings us to Abner \"Longie\" Zwillman, who might just be the first ever in that category to hit a K Score of 3.\n\nZwillman was a mob boss, which definitely puts him in Sociopaths. He ran the Jewish mob of northern New Jersey in the 1930s and 40s. (We guess this can also put him in the Businesspeople category? Why not!) The so-called \"Al Capone of New Jersey\" was an associate of such luminaries as Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky. So why are we kvelling? No, it's not because of New Jersey!\n\nYou see, besides his many... sociopathic activities, in the 1930s, he organized the New Jersey Minutemen, an anti-fascist group that stood up to the various Nazi organizations, such as the German American Bund.\n\nAlright, being from New Jersey doesn't hurt either!",
