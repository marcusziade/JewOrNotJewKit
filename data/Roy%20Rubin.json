  "description": "As we wrote years ago, the best coach in NBA history, Red Auerbach, was Jewish. Alas, the worst coach in NBA history was Jewish as well... (No, we obviously don't mean Magic Johnson. This guy was worse.)\n\nThis guy was Roy Rubin, and if you're not heard of him, you're not alone. When he took the 76ers job back in 1972, he was the coach of something called Long Island University. Rubin got the job through a want ad in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Yes, an actual NBA team hired a coach from a newspaper job posting. This is not a sentence that will ever be uttered again.\n\nRubin promptly started by losing his first 15 games. It didn't get much better; by midyear, with the Sixers at 4-47, he got the axe. The team ended the season 9-73, the worst record in NBA history. Rubin never coached basketball again.\n\nInstead, he went to Broadway, producing a play that starred Abe Vigoda as Abraham Lincoln. The play was canceled after a single performance.\n\nThe worst producer in Broadway history?",
