  "description": "At JONJ, we specialize in non-Jews who are mistaken to be Jews and vice versa. But a man mistaken to be a woman? That's a new one.\n\nApparently, in Lithuania (ironically, also the home of the man purse) where Povich's family originated, Shirley was a very masculine name. In the rest of the world, not so much. So all time baseball writing great Shirley Povich was accidentally listed in Who's Who in American Women in 1958. Whoops!\n\nAnd, really, no one could blame the Who's Who women from wanted him among their number. Povich was one of the great baseball poets, from a time when sports journalists weren't screaming out sound bites at the top of their lungs or fighting to the death for the right be \"Shocked, just shocked\" at an athlete's behavior.\n\nThe sportswriter of the earlier century was more of a gentleman observer, who waxed reflectively throughout his prose, giving baseball it's rhythm and respectful air. And Povich was the master of his craft. \n\nPlus, he's one of only a handful of Jews to make the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWe can't say for sure — but chances are — Shirley was a lot more proud of that than his Who's Who listing.",
