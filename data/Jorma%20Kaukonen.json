  "description": "According to guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, if his grandfather, Ben Levine, didn't marry his grandmother, Vera, he would have been born an Orthodox Jew. Vera was an anarchist who frowned on religion, so their daughter, Beatrice, was raised secular. And so was Jorma, saddled with such a goyishe, Finnish name.\n\nOf course, if Jorma would have been born an Orthodox Jew, there probably wouldn't be Jefferson Airplane, the band he helped found. And if there was no Jefferson Airplane, there might not have been psychedelic rock. And if there was no psychedelic rock, the 70s might have turned out completely differently. And if... well, you get the picture.\n\nJorma actually embraced Judaism late in his life. His wife converted, and the guitarist has now returned to his roots.\n\nSo it all worked out?\n\nOf course, if Jorma's grandfather didn't marry his grandmother, there wouldn't be Jorma in the first place...\n\nYes, it definitely all worked out.",
