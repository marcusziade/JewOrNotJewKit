  "description": "If one was to make the list of most influential authors of the 20th century, surely Franz Kafka would be on it. They even made an adjective out of his name: Kafkaesque.\n\n\"The Metamorphosis\", \"The Trial\", \"The Castle\"? All ground-breaking, all modern classics, all...\n\nAll wouldn't exist without Max Brod. Of Kafka's three most famous works, only \"The Metamorphosis\" was published during his life, and received little attention. As for his unpublished work, he famously asked Brod to destroy it all after his death. Brod didn't.\n\nNo, Brod, a fellow Jew, didn't listen to his friend. Instead of burning the manuscripts, he published them, and the rest is history. But Brod went further than that: \"The Trial\" was left unfinished, broken into loose unordered chapters. He compiled, edited, and finished off the text.\n\nSo, Kafka's \"The Trial\", only one of the most famous, ground-breaking novels of the 20th century, should not be credited to Kafka, but to Kafka AND Brod.\n\nTalk about Kafkaesque.",
