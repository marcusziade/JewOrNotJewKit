  "description": "Last year's mostly-overlooked, but mostly-funny movie, \"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People\", centers around Sidney Young, a celebrity reporter. His first assignment involves interviewing a Broadway star, during which Sidney learns two things: you don't ask anyone from Broadway if they're gay... or if they're Jewish. \"Just assume they're both,\" his boss says.\n\nHollywood hilarity? Not quite. For \"How to Lose Friends\" is autobiographical, and Sidney is based on British journalist Toby Young (clever name substitution there, sir), who asked those two questions of one of Broadway's biggest stars, Nathan Lane.\n\nLane was so thrown back, he answered \"yes\" to being Jewish and stormed out when asked if he was gay.\n\nWell, to set the record straight, Lane is definitely gay, and he is definitely NOT Jewish.\n\nAt last, there's something that's considered more embarrassing and publicly inappropriate than being Jewish! That's good, right?\n\nRight?",
