  "description": "We have hundreds of profiles on this website of people with one Jewish and one goyishe parent. As a rule, those get an I Score of 3... but the verdict differs. Prepare for a deep dive!\n\n\"Jew\": They consider themselves Jewish. End of. Failing that, there is no evidence of them practicing another religion.\n\n\"Borderline Jew\": It's not exactly clear. Maybe they celebrate Christmas or something.\n\n\"Barely a Jew\": They worship at the altar of a goyishe deity, usually Jebus. Or there is this: \"I am not Jewish\".\n\nThat's from French actor/director Mathieu Kassovitz. His father is a Hungarian Jew. His mother, a French goy. You might remember from that famous Manic Pixie Dream Girl movie from 1990s, \"Amelie\". (He is not Amelie.) Or from a bunch of... other French stuff. No, you probably don't remember him. \n\nHere's the full quote: \"I am not Jewish but I was brought up in a world of Jewish humor\".\n\nAre we sure we can't push him up to \"Borderline Jew\"?",
