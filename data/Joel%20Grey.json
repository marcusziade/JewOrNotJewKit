  "description": "Our recent ourcry about the lack of profiled Katzes elicited a spirited response from our readers, who sent in an array of Katzes, Catzes, and Katses of various obscurity.\n\nSo here is one: Joel Katz, or, as he is better known, Joel Grey. He is a rather esteemed actor, with a Tony, an Oscar, and a Grammy to his name. (He was nominated for an Emmy as well, for a guest spot on the rather Jewy \"Brooklyn Bridge\". Alas, that EGOT was not not to be.)\n\nGrey is even a veteran of Yiddish theater, directing a recent adaptation of (what else) \"Fiddler on the Roof\". (So, for those counting, Yiddish -\u003e English -\u003e Yiddish.) In doing so, he went back to the roots, as Grey's first ever stage performance was at the age of 16 as something called the \"Borscht Capades\"... a revue produced by his father, comedian Mickey Katz.\n\nIn fact, the family can count three generation of performers. You might have heard of Joel's daughter, \"Dirty Dancing\" star Jennifer Katz Grey...\n\nKatzes!",
