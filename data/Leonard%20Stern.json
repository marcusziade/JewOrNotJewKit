A friend asked him for two adjectives to describe a character's nose. Stern's responses were \"clumsy\" and \"naked\".\n\nSoon, Stern and his friend, Roger Price,\ncreated Mad Libs. The two started publishing the books with great success. They were especially enjoyed by children, who loved the silly results.\n\nAnd yes, of course Stern was Jewish!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns1 = document.getElementById(\"screen1\");\ns2 = document.getElementById(\"screen2\");\ns3 = document.getElementById(\"screen3\");\nt1 = document.getElementById(\"text1\");\nt2 = document.getElementById(\"text2\");\nbs = document.sf.b;\nlen = bs.length;\nt2.innerHTML = t1.innerHTML;\nfunction go() {\n bad = false;\n for (i=0;i\u003clen;i++) {\n   bs[i].value = bs[i].value.trim();\n   if (bs[i].value == '') bad = true;\n }\n if (bad) {\n  alert(\"Please enter all values\");\n  return;\n }\n for (i=0;i\u003clen;i++) {\n  pp = document.getElementById(\"p\"+i);\n  pp.innerHTML = bs[i].value;\n }\n hideDiv(s1); hideDiv(s3); showDiv(s2);\n}\nfunction reset() {\n for (i=0;i\u003clen;i++) {\n   bs[i].value = '';\n }\n hideDiv(s2); hideDiv(s3); showDiv(s1);\n}\nfunction original() {\n hideDiv(s2); hideDiv(s1); showDiv(s3);\n}",
