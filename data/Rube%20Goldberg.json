  "description": "How to wake up on Shabbat to freshly-made latkes:\n\n\n\nThe alarm clock (A) rings. You (B) hit the snooze button (C) with your hand. The depressed button activates the see-saw (D), making the potato (E) on the other end drop down the chute (F). Meanwhile, your stretched arms pull on the string (G) that activates the guillotine (H). The guillotine slices the potato that's rolling through the chute and ends up on the frying pan (I).\n\nNote: to turn on the gas, either leave it on Friday before sunset, or ask a non-Jewish neighbor.\n\nIllustration by Jennifer Jordan",
