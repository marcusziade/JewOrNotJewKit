  "description": "It seems like ages since we last looked into our mailbox. Well, here is a strange suggestion: Matt Damon. He seems a very unlikely candidate to be Jewish, but let's see.\n\nHmmmm. A reader from New York City is telling us that Matt's three-year-old daughter attends nursery school in his temple. Well, we'd be...\n\nObviously, one doesn't have to be Jewish to have their child attend Jewish nursery school. And no, Damon isn't. But... Well, we always liked Matt Damon. He's a pretty good actor, much better than his heterosexual life partner Ben Affleck. And we're told he's rather good looking. And this openness to other cultures, specifically the Jewish one? Can't go wrong with that.\n\nSo let's wrap this up, except... what's that? That same reader now says that Matt quietly transferred his daughter to a secular school. Hmmmm. Not good.\n\nDid we just say we liked Matt Damon? We take it back. Good actor? We wouldn't say he is as bad as Affleck, but all that squinting and brow furrowing isn't that difficult. And good looking? If you're into rectangular headed fellows, we guess he might be. Otherwise? Meh.\n\nWell, that got us nowhere. So much for our mailbox...",
