  "description": "We can't wait for this whole pandemic to be over so we can go on vacation. Our first destination? Grenada.\n\nNo, we don't want to taste the local nutmeg or visit the site of the 1983 US invasion. We don't even want to go to the main island, imaginatively named... Grenada. Our target: Carriacou Island. Specifically: the island's Jew Bay. Why?\n\nWhy indeed! It seems that no one has any idea why the body of water to the east of Carriacou has that name. Grenada itself has very little Jewish history, and that minuscule amount seems unlikely to have reached the far-off island. Did the bay get its name because a Jewish tourist once swam there? Is it a bad transliteration of the French word \"jeu\"? Perhaps it's where the island's fishermen caught the not-so-delicious Jewfish? Nobody knows...\n\nSo we will go to Jew Bay, Carriacou Island, Grenada, and try to find out.\n\nGetting out of the house will be nice too...",
