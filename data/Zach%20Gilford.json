  "description": "One of the joys of watching \"Friday Night Lights\" (the TV show) is finding out what these very talented young adults (emphasis on adults) are up to! Let's go through the list (we're only up to Season 3, so forgive future omissions):\n\nJesse Plemons (Landry): He's been in everything from \"Breaking Bad\" to \"Fargo\" to \"The Irishman\". What a way to start it off!\nTaylor Kitsch (Riggins): Remember when \"John Carter\" was supposed to be a hit? Remember season 2 of \"True Detective\"? Kitsch probably doesn't remember either, and that's for the best.\nAdrianne Palicki (Tyra): She was on \"Agents of Shield\"? Secondary roles in a bunch of action movies? She deserves better.\nScott Porter (Jason): Nothing. Well, a little more than nothing, but pretty much nothing.\nGaius Charles (Smash): He was on \"Gray's Anatomy\" for a couple of seasons. Better than nothing!\nAimee Teegarden (Julie): Oh, poor Jules, the only one who actually resembled a teenager! Nothing.\nZach Gilford (Matt): Here's our biggest disappointment, and no, not because Gilford is Jewish in real life (that nose is a dead giveaway, but there are no Jews in Texas, so the James Wilson Law doesn't apply). He played Taylor Swift's love interest in a music video.\nMinka Kelly (Lyla): Dated Chris Evans, Derek Jeter and Trevor Noah. Better than nothing?",
