  "description": "\"Parks and Recreation\", which started its run as a cumbersome companion to \"The Office\", and ended it as an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking sitcom, helped the careers of the many previously-unknowns who made up its cast.\n\nThe most obvious one is Chris Pratt, who was sixth-billed on \"Parks\", but somehow transformed himself into Star-Lord. Aziz Ansari, a little-known comedian, is now heading his own, critically acclaimed series, \"Master of None\". Aubrey Plaza went from being a nobody to being an emo queen. Nick Offerman's deadpan style became a welcome addition to numerous comedic vehicles.\n\nAnd then there is Ben Schwartz. His role on \"Parks\" wasn't major by any strech of imagination; he was the delightfully-named Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, the crazy-haired lunatic who appeared in a bunch of episodes. And yet, Schwartz parlayed his role into a massive movie franchise that even bypasses Star-Lord's.\n\nHe beeps for BB-8 in \"Star Wars\".",
