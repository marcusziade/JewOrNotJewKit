  "description": "Lemony Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" is a book series with bone-chilling bewilderments, macabre manifestations, and a stew of red herrings. Through the thirteen novels, Daniel Handler, in the guise of Snicket, takes the reader on a journey of one's worst fears.\n\nChildren adore it.\n\nHandler ends each book in the series with unanswered questions and puzzling circumstances, leaving the reader wanting for more. But if one expects everything to be wrapped up neatly by book thirteen, ominously titled \"The End\", boy, is one in for a surprise.\n\nBut one question does not need to be answered. For yes, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are in fact Jewish. Yes, there's a (fictional) Jewish boy named Klaus. We blame his (fictional) parents.\n\nHandler admits it, saying that one can tell \"not only from their manner but from the occasional mention of a rabbi or bar mitzvah or synagogue.\" He adds, \"the careful reader will find quite a few rabbis.\"\n\nQuite a few rabbis? Well, it looks like we'll have to engross ourselves in some Unfortunate Events once again, won't we?",
