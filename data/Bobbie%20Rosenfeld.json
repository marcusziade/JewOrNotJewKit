  "description": "Fanny Rosenfeld is considered Canada's greatest female athlete of all time. (We know that's akin to being the tallest midget... We kid, Canada, we kid. We kid because we love.) She starred in basketball, softball, tennis, and (of course) hockey. She won two Olympic medals in track. Every year, Canada gives out the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award to the country's best female athlete.\n\nNo, you didn't just misread that. Even though her given name was Fanny, she went by Bobbie. The nickname was given to her because of her haircut.\n\nBesides all the Canadian accolades, Fanny collected some Jewish ones as well. In fact, she was the first Jewish woman to win Olympic gold, leading Canada's 4 x 100 relay team to glory in 1928.\n\nAs for the name change... We're not gonna fret about it. Bobbie might sound goyishe, but anything is better than Fanny...",
