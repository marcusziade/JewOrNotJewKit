  "description": "Is \"Die Hard\" a Christmas movie?\n\nIt's the type of pointless argument that for some reason gripes the Internet, much like \"is a hot dog a sandwich?\" Even Bruce Willis himself has chimed in: he says it's not. It's just a movie that takes place on Christmas.\n\nNot to disagree with Mr. Willis, but not only is \"Die Hard\" a Christmas movie, it's the best Christmas movie, and the only watchable Christmas movie there is. (Fine. \"Home Alone\". It's one of two watchable Christmas movies.) What, you're gonna say \"It's a Wonderful Life\"? \"Miracle on 34th Street\"? The incredibly overrated \"A Christmas Story?\" Puh-lease.\n\nAs a side note, not only is \"Die Hard\" the best Christmas movie, it's the only good \"Die Hard\" movie. The overrated sequel (it's on an airplane!) is unwatchable, there is a little uptick with #3, but it just falls off the cliff from there.\n\nAnd no, a hot dog is if (parseInt(Math.random()*2)==1) document.write(\"not\"); a sandwich. Duh.",
