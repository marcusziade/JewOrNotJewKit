  "description": "It seems like every year we have a quest.\n\nLast year, it was our quest for a prominent, respectable Jewish politician (brought to an end by Michael Bloomberg). This year, it seems we're set on searching for a starting shortstop, and after a false start with Ben Zobrist, we finally have our man: MVP, manager, broadcaster and (OMG!) shortstop Lou Boudreau.\n\nOh sure, the name sounds French, but Boudreau's got his Judaism where it counts (on his mother's side, although he was raised Catholic). And sure, unless you're one of the people that actually got the joke in our Nate Silver profile, you probably have no earthly idea who Boudreau was. \n\nBut we're not talking about some random kid who happened to stand at short, here. Boudreau was the real deal, led the Indians to the championship in 1948 (their LAST championship, we might add), made multiple all star teams, and was a legitimate Hall of Famer. \n\nSo there you have it â€” quest got. What will we search for next year? Jewish Eskimos, Jewish sports mascots, Jewish synchronized swimmers? \nWho knows? Anything is possible.\n\n(Except that last one.)",
