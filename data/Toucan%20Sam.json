  "description": "Ah, the breakfast cereal aisle! Filled with bright colors, fascinating toys, and delightful mascots that can't wait to brainwash your children. From the Lucky Charms leprechaun to the Rice Krispies elves, they are all too eager to sink their sugary fingers into your wallet.\n\nBut here at Jew or Not Jew, we don't make trips to the cereal aisle to buy cereal. We go there to find Jews. Here's why:\n\nWhen we were writing the Mel Blanc profile, it came up that he was the original voice of Toucan Sam, the Froot Loops mascot. Blanc was replaced by Paul Frees, another Jew. So that, coupled with a rather Jewish first name, and, let's face it, the toucan's very large nose, rose the usual question at JONJ Headquarters. We argued for a while, but no conclusion could be reached.\n\nAnd then it hit us... why not ask a child! Surely, a three-year-old will see the true nature of cereal mascots! So to the cereal aisle we went.\n\nThe results were beyond astonishing. The three-year-old clearly identified Toucan Sam as a Jew, while laughingly rejecting the leprechaun and the elves, as well as the Trix Rabbit and Cap'n Crunch. \n\nSo here it is, from the mouth of babes. Now, if only Count Chocula was still being sold... That one has been bugging us for years.",
