  "description": "Here's a tip for all young actresses out there:\n\nWhen Tom Cruise tries to convert you to Scientology (and he WILL try to convert you to Scientology), just silently walk away. You aren't the first, you won't be the last.\n\nAnd please, whatever you do, do not falsely claim that you have Jewish grandmothers. It just gets very confusing.\n\nYou see, when Cruise met Keri Russell on the set of Mission Impossible 3, he tried to spread his freaky cult onto her. The actress resisted, claiming that her Jewish grandmothers would be worried. And the world picked up on it, assuming Keri is Jewish.\n\nWhich she isn't. Keri is actually of Mormon descent, with absolutely nothing Jewish on her family tree, be it grandmother or not. Apparently, she was just kidding. Sorry, Jewish Felicity fans.\n\nOh, and another tip for young actresses: don't cut your hair short.\n\nBut that one should be obvious.",
