  "description": "Today, we're profiling Timo... Timothee... Wait, that's not Timoth\ufffde Chalamet, right?\n\nNo, that's not dreamboat-de-jour Chalamet. That's Devon Levi. He's a goaltender for the Buffalo Sabres. And damned if he doesn't look like Timo... Tim. Tim Chalamet.\n\nLike Chalemet, Levi has the potential for stardom, be it on the sports arena. He was named best goaltender at the World Junior Championship, blazed through two years at Northeastern (where he majored in computer science), and was a backup for Canada at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nSo, what's more unlikely, a young Jewish man becoming a Hollywood heartthrob, or a starting goaltender in the National Hockey League?\n\nGoaltender, duh, but Levi is not full-time starter yet...\n\nGive him time?",
