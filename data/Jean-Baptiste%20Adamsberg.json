  "description": "We found him! We found that Jewish fictional detective! And it all has to do with a French woman named Fred.\n\nNo, the French woman named Fred is not the Jewish fictional detective. She is a writer, Fred Vargas (actually, Frederique Audouin-Rouzeau), a very popular crime novelist in France. Vargas' most famous character is Commissaire Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg.\n\nBecause all fictional detectives have to be quirky, Adamsberg is very forgetful, very disorganized, very disheveled, very promiscuous, and, (of course!) very brilliant. Alas, he is not very Jewish: from what we read, religion doesn't play a role in his life. Yet Vargas made a point to give him a Jewish surname to go with a Christian given name to make the character a bit more complex and conflicted.\n\nSo there we go, a Jewish fictional detective!\n\nWait a minute... Wasn't there one in Michael Chabon's \"The Yiddish Policemen's Union\"? Of course there was, Meyer Landsman, duh! Ummmmm...\n\nSo there we go, a French Jewish fictional detective! Hooray!",
