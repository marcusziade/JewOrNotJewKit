  "description": "When we profiled Judith Resnik, we implied that there were only two well-known Jewish astronauts (the other being Ilan Ramon)... and they both died during missions. Not exactly an uplifting statement.\n\nBut why dwell on the bad? Let's celebrate... Jews... in... Space! (Zooming along, protecting the Human Race!)\n\nResnik was actually the first American Jew in space, taking off in 1984, and was followed by Jeffrey Hoffman, a year later. (He actually read from the Torah in space!) They are joined by Ellen Baker, Marsha Ivins, Jerome Apt, David Wolf, Martin Fettman, John Grunsfeld, Scott Horowitz, Mark Polansky, Garrett Reisman, and Gregory Chamitoff.\n\nSo there you have it. 13 Jews astronauts in total. Over 30 flights among them (Hoffman, Ivins, and Grunsfled check in at five each). Mel Brooks must be proud.\n\nAnd so would Judith Resnik.",
