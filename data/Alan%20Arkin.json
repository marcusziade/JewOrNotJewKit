  "description": "We finally saw \"Argo\" the other day — very entertaining, to say the least — and decided to read up on the story the movie was based on. Here's what struck us: none of it happened.\n\nAlright, a lot of it happened, but the movie sure took its liberties with real-life events. Take the location scout in the Tehran bazaar. Completely made up. The Canadian involvement in the rescue? Much greater than depicted. The last-minute escape in the airport? Not true. The hostages quietly left, and no one was the wiser.\n\nEven Alan Arkin's character, the producer who helps get the fake film off the ground? Not real. (By the way, we love how they hinted the producer is Jewish. Of course, he is!)\n\nBut we're not complaining. Oh, sure, maybe transposing everything that went down in real life onto the big screen might have made the movie more factual. But it definitely wouldn't be so entertaining...",
