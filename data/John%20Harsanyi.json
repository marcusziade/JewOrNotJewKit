  "description": "John Nash might be one of the most widely-known Nobel laureates, and not because of his scientific work, of course. Being a subject of an Oscar-winning movie tends to go a long away. (Having Russell Crowe portray you doesn't hurt either.) But did you know that Nash, who won the Economics Nobel in 1994, actually shared his prize with two others?\n\nJoining the goyishe Nash were Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. Selten was born in Germany to a Jewish father and goyishe mother. He was raised Protestant, and was lucky to have survived World War II when his family was exiled (as opposed to something much worse). Harsanyi was born to a Jewish family in Hungary, but they decided to convert out before he was born. He was lucky to have survived World War II after being forced into a German labor camp, but escaping.\n\nIn any case, the trio won their Nobel for work in the field on non-cooperative game theory. (We're not sure if they cooperated among themselves.) So, if you ever played a computer or a modern board game, it's quite likely you're familiar with the work of Selten and Harsanyi (and Nash, fine).\n\nAlas, only one of them got the movie treatment... but Selten and Harsanyi get to share this profile? Sorry, John Nash.\n\nselten = false;\nfunction flip(s) {\nif (s == null) {\n selten = !selten;\n} else {\n selten = s;\n}\nif (selten) {\n memorize();\n setImage('reinhard_selten');\n setTitle('Reinhard Selten');\n setRatings(3, 2, 5);\n setVerdict('Barely a Jew');\n setSubhead('October 5, 1930 - August 23, 2016');\n} else {\n remember();\n}\n}",
