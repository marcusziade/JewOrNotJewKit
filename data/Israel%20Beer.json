  "description": "Israel Beer should have gotten himself circumcised.\n\nLet's backtrack a second. Who was Israel Beer?\n\nThat question is not that easy to answer. According to Beer (also spelled Baer and Bar), he was born in Austria, fought in the Spanish Civil War, and immigrated to Palestine in the 1930s. From there, he joined the IDF, was discharged, and worked at the Israeli Ministry of Defense.\n\nEverything was going quite well for Beer, until he was caught with his pants down (figuratively), selling Israeli secrets to the Soviets. Then, the Israelis checked him with his pants down (literally), and found out that his story didn't exactly add up.\n\nYou see, Beer wasn't circumcised. So his whole story of being an Austrian Jew fell down like a house of cards.\n\nBeer ended up dying in an Israeli jail. To date, no one is sure what his name real is... or if he was in fact Jewish (but we have our guess).\n\nYou see, sometimes a little circumcision goes a long way...",
