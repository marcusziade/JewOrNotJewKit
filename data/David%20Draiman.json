  "description": "Dave Mustaine, living proof that \"always a bridesmaid never a bride\" applies to heavy metal guitarists, was born Jewish but converted out and now refuses to perform with any band that is \"black metal\" or \"satanic,\" somehow forgetting that his own band is called \"Megadeath.\"\n\nDavid Lee Roth is Jewish as well, but he never sang about Jerusalem Girls (or, for that matter, Livingston, NJ girls) or how he was Hot for Hebrews. Scott Ian, Gene Simmons, the Beastie Boys, Lenny Kravitz.... Not a one outwardly embraces the fact that they are Jews.\n\nLook, we're not asking for a 20 minute power ballad based on the epic themes of the Kol Nidre here (although that. would. be. AWESOME), just, y'know, maybe a lyric here or there? After all, if the Black Eyed Peas can shout mazel tov in a song... But no.\n\nSo all the more reason to love David Draiman, lead singer of the surprisingly sonic-ly pleasant band Disturbed. David is openly, proudly, Jewish, even calling out other bands for appropriating Nazi symbolism and performing a song called \"Never Again\" about the Holocaust. Now that's a Jewish rock star!\n\nAnd if Dave Mustaine won't perform with Disturbed because he can't handle their little devil icon or whatever? Don't worry about it. Plenty of other people have done quite well for themselves for deciding not to play with Dave Mustaine.",
