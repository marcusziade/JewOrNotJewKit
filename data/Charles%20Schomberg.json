  "description": "England used to rule the sea for centuries. Everyone has heard of its defeat of the Spanish Armada, or Admiral Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar, or famed explorers Francis Drake and James Cook... but few have heard about a whole family of English Jewish sea captains!\n\nWe need to use \"Jewish\" loosely here. It all started with Meyer Low Schomberg, a German doctor who emigrated to England and then got disillusioned with Judaism. He encouraged his children to convert, and they did just that. The one son of interest is Alexander, who joined the Navy and became captain, serving in the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War. He got knighted for his efforts.\n\nAfter retiring from the Navy, Alexander settled down and had two children: Alexander (clearly, the goyishe lack of imagination rubbed off) and Charles. The former took part in the French Revolutionary Wars, mostly in the Caribbean, and even rose to the rank of admiral. The latter also fought the French, mostly in the Mediterranean (as well as thwarting their efforts in the Indian Ocean). Also knighted, Charles was rewarded at the end of his life with the title of commodore and the governorship of Dominica.\n\nAnd then there was their cousin Isaac, who fought in the American Revolutionary War. This captain is best known for pissing off then-prince Henry (future king William IV) and being court-martialed.\n\nEvery family has a black sheep, even English Jewish sea captains!",
