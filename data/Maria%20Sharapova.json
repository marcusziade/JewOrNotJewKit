  "description": "So, we're gonna profile a female tennis player. Who should it be?\n\nPerhaps Shahar Peer, the highly-ranked Israeli who was recently denied a visa to play in the Dubai Open? Or Hungarian Zsuzsa Kormoczy, the only openly Jewish woman to win a Grand Slam title (French Open, 1968)?\n\nNo... We're gonna profile Maria Sharapova.\n\nOh, Maria is not Jewish. That cross around her neck should erase any doubts. But she recently did purchase an apartment in Israel... Why would she do that?\n\nTo get closer to the Holy Land? Doubtful. To make a wise real estate investment? In this economy? To convert to Judaism? Unlikely, and you don't need to move to Israel to do that (her primary residence in Florida, after all).\n\nPerhaps, to settle with a nice Jewish boy? (Don't worry, honey, she's too tall for us.) We wouldn't bet on it.\n\nThen why?\n\nTo get profiled on Jew or Not Jew? No? Maybe? Let us indulge in this fantasy, OK?",
