  "description": "There is a famous Saturday Night Live sketch in which Tom Hanks joins the Five-Timers Club: people who have hosted the show five or more times. He is given a club robe, taught a secret handshake, and greeted by Paul Simon, Elliott Gould, and Mr. Steve Martin.\n\nAnother person who should have been there to greet Hanks? Buck Henry.\n\nNever heard of him!\n\nBy the time Hanks made his fifth appearance, Henry had already hosted the show ten times, all between 1976 and 1980. In fact, for four straight years, he hosted the last episode of the season.\n\nShould we have heard of him?\n\nHenry, born Henry Zuckerman, is best known for co-creating \"Get Smart\" with Mel Brooks. He also co-wrote the screenplay for \"The Graduate\" and appeared in a bunch of films in small roles. How exactly did that qualify to be the first member of the Five-Timers Club? Beats us.\n\nAt least, now, we have heard of him.",
