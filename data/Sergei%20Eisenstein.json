  "description": "We try to be honest at JONJ. The first profile we ever posted was Charlie Chaplin; many out there think that Chaplin was a Jew, but that sadly was not the case. So it seemed the perfect place to kick off the \"Not Jew\" part of our website.\n\nOf course, we would have loved to claim Chaplin as one of our own. And the same goes for many other rumored Jews, from Dwight Eisenhower to Robert De Niro. But our honesty keeps us from doing so. Honesty and fear of the profilee's relatives.\n\nSo it's that honesty that forces us to knock down another silent movie pioneer, Sergei Eisenstein, from the Jew verdict. As with Chaplin, many assume he was Jewish, but it's not that simple here. He was at most a quarter by birth, and that Jewish grandparent converted to Russian Orthodoxy.\n\nBut all was not lost with Sergei. He was definitely proud of his Jewish roots, and used Yiddish slang and humor. Plus, he pioneered the Jewfro years before it became popular. Which, even by itself, would be good enough for us, in all honesty.",
