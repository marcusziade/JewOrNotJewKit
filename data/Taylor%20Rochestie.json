  "description": "America's greatest sporting export? Basketball players. With NBA rosters limited to a finite number, many try to find employment abroad. Some succeed, becoming household names an ocean away.\n\nThen comes the next step: naturalization. Some Americans are deemed good enough to represent various national teams, providing they can acquire a passport. At the last Basketball World Cup, Americans turned out for Brazil, Croatia, Ukraine, and the Philippines. At the last European championship, for Finland, Georgia (THAT Georgia, not that Georgia), Slovenia, and Israel.\n\nWhich brings us to Taylor Rochestie. Undrafted out of college, his career has taken him to Germany, Turkey, France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Israel, and Serbia. A few years ago, he led the entire EuroLeague in scoring. Along the way, Taylor acquired a Montenegrin passport, allowing him to play for their national team. (He would also be eligible for an Israeli passport, since he is half Jewish, but Taylor decided to go with the Balkan country.)\n\nAmerica's worst sporting export? Soccer players. If you can't tell, we're still bitter about missing that World Cup...",
