  "description": "There is a Jewish hockey player who had held a number of NHL records, and we haven't profiled him yet? How come?\n\nIt has nothing to do with our recent disenchantment with the NHL (thanks for another lockout, Commissioner Bettman). It's just that outside of those records, the career of Moe Roberts was... not exactly remarkable.\n\nIn 1925, Roberts became the youngest goaltender in NHL history, when he debuted for the Boston Bruins at the age of 19. In 1951, he became the oldest player in NHL history, when he appeared for the Chicago Black Hawks at the age of 45.\n\nIn between those appearances, Roberts played a grand total of eight NHL games.\n\nThat's right; his NHL career might have spanned four decades, but it wasn't exactly remarkable. His debut came because the Bruins needed an injury replacement. So did his last appearance; by then, he was working as the Black Hawks' trainer, and the team got desperate when their starter got injured during the game.\n\nNevertheless, Roberts, a Jew, is still the oldest goaltender to appear in the NHL. That's remarkable enough for us.",
