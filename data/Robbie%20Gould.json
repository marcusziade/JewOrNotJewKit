  "description": "In the early days of Jew or Not Jew, the Super Bowl profile was a tradition. But, since Jewish linkage to the Super Bowl is rarely evident (we profiled Peyton Manning because he went to a once-Jewish school, for crying out loud!), the tradition was put on hold.\n\nUntil this year, that is! Super Bowl LIV will feature a Jew: Kansas City's Mitchell Schwartz, one of the best offensive linemen in the game. Alas, we already wrote about him back in the day as part of a tag-team profile with big brother Geoff. So no on Schwartz.\n\nWhich brings us to often-Jewish-rumored 49ers kicker Robbie Gould (pronounced \"Gold\"), now returning to the Super Bowl for the first time after making it with the Bears back in 2007, when this website was barely a few months old. According to him, Robert Paul Gould III is in \"no way\" Jewish, so we'll have to leave it at that.\n\nStrangely, Gould now becomes the second current 49er to receive a Super Bowl profile. Teammate Richard Sherman got one when he was with Seattle.
