  "description": "What happened to the proud comic tradition of actors playing multiple roles in the same movie?\n\nFrom Charlie Chaplin in \"The Great Dictator\" to Jerry Lewis in \"The Nutty Professor\" to Mel Brooks (of course!) in \"Blazing Saddles\". These are some of comedy's legendary performances. And perhaps none more than Peter Sellers in \"Dr. Strangelove\", the acclaimed film that more than stood the test of time.\n\nBut what about now?\n\nWe have Mike Myers confusing himself in \"Austin Powers\", which, sure, was fine for a couple of movies. We have Eddie Murphy attempting to channel Lewis as his own professor (as well as his entire flatulent family), before killing his career for the umpteenth time with obtuse \"Norbit\". And now, worst of all, we have Adam Sandler, playing the idiotic Jack to his grotesque Jill.\n\nYou know what, before we get caught up in all this, let's just point out that Sellers was a Jew... (half by birth through his mother, and he self-identified). From \"Dr. Strangelove\" to \"Jack and Jill\"? Seriously?",
