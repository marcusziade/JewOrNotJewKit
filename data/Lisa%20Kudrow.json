Hey, we're an inclusive website.\n\nSo far, no one has said Phoebe.\n\nAnd that makes a lot of sense; Phoebe, although not Jewish on the show, is played by Lisa Kudrow, who looks so obviously Jewish that us Jewish males tend to stay away (remember: we don't want women who remind us of our mothers).\n\nBut what's interesting, in an informal survey of goyim, a lot of them do find Kudrow attractive. More than that: gorgeous. Hot. Sexy. Yeah, we're not seeing it either. But here's a proof of yentappeal if there ever was one.\n\nWell, one small problem. We have no idea if Kudrow's real-life husband, French ad exec Michael Stern, is a Jew. With that name, he just might be... and that just might blow up the whole yentappeal theory.\n\nBut then again, if Mr. Stern could have his picking of Friends, he might have gone with Rachel as well...",
