  "description": "We've been getting a lot of requests for the somewhat popular (and Emmy nominated) actress, the half Jewish (but raised Catholic) Lea Michele from the TV show Glee.\n\nOf course, we're happy to talk about favorite TV shows. For instance, we've really been getting into our DVDs of Battlestar Galactica lately.\n\nNot the old 70s TV show, but the recent re-make, shown in what used to be called syndication on what used to be called the Sci-Fi channel (the new name, Syfy, is rumored to be another word for syphilis in Poland, so we're certainly not going to be using that). The premise is the same: a group of star lost humans searching for the mythological planet Earth while being chased through the galaxy by evil robots hell bent on destroying all mankind.\n\nThe special effects are remarkable for a cable series (no styrofoam to be seen). The acting ranges from not bad to really really good (again, no styrofoam). The episodes are actually well thought out, well written (no styro... oh, you get the picture). It may be one of the best things we've seen on television. That's right: not just good science fiction television but good television television. Right up there with Mad Men. Seriously? Seriously.\n\nWhat's that? You couldn't give two shits about Battlestar Galactica? You just want to hear about Lea Michele and Glee?\n\nThat's funny. We were about to say the exact opposite.",
