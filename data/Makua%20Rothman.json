  "description": "Makua Rothman is a bagel salesman. His family owns Banzai Bagels on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. So if you are ever on the north shore, drop by! Who better to sell bagels in Hawaii than the half Jewish, half native surfer!\n\nAbout that surfer part: for Rothman, it's not just a hobby. He is a big wave surfer, one of the best in the world. And earlier this year he rode a 100-foot wave.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpressive, isn't it? Obviously, exact measurements are impossible, but it just might be the tallest surfed wave ever.\n\nNot bad for a bagel salesman!",
