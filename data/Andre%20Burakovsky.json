  "description": "Amazingly, it has been reported that there are two Jewish NHLers whose fathers also played in the league. Can someone say... Jewish hockey dynasties?\n\nThere is Eric Nystrom, a ten-year veteran, whose father, Bob, was a star with the Islanders in the 80s. But Bob never converted, just raised his kids Jewish. So strike the Nystroms.\n\nAnd then there's Andre Burakovsky, a promising rookie with the Washington Capitals. He is an Austrian-born Swede with Russian Jewish roots. His father, Robert, had a journeyman career that spanned the world and also included one year in the NHL, with the then-awful Ottawa Senators.\n\nSo, with all this Jewish generational prowess in hockey, what's next? Pigs flying? Cats befriending dogs? Priests attending synagogue? Jewish golf dynasties?\n\nOh. Burakovsky has denied that he, or either of his parents, is Jewish. It just looks that his grandfather was. So strike the Burakovskys.\n\nDid someone say, Jewish golf dynasties?",
