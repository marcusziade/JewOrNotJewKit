  "description": "To call London a melting pot doesn't do it justice. It's a melting pot of melting pots, with cultures from every corner of the globe throw in. Royal palaces are a block away from kebab shops. The smells of curry,  jerk spices, pizza, turmeric, and borscht fill the air. It's as cosmopolitan as a city can be.\n\nSo who better to lead it than Alexander Boris de Pfeffel... let's just say Boris Johnson, for short. London's mayor is... get this:\n\nAmerican-born\nDescendant from two English kings\nPart Turkish\nPart German\nHas Muslim roots\nEducated in Belgium\nMarried a Sikh\n\nAnd oh, yes, of course:\n\nHas Jewish roots\n\nCan't be the most cosmopolitan mayor without that part, right?\n\n(Editor's update, July 23, 2019: Well, he turned out to be quite a nutjob. And now... Prime Minister?)",
