  "description": "Alfred Stieglitz is considered one of the early pioneers of photography. In fact, he was instrumental in developing it as an art form. The son of German Jewish immigrants, he is perhaps best known for two things: being married to artist Georgia O'Keefe (Not a Jew), and creating the first ever \"modernist\" photograph.\n\nThat photograph is \"The Steerage\", taken in New York in 1907. It not only documented history, it used shapes to do so. Even Picasso was a fan: \"This photographer is working in the same spirit as I am.\"\n\n [X]\n\n\nThere is also something not obvious in this photograph: while most assume it pictures immigrants arriving in New York... it's actually a photo of a cruise ship leaving America for Europe!\n\nNot knowing what's actually pictured... That's modern art for you.",
