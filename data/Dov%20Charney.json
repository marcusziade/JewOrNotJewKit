  "description": "American Apparel. That store in the mall with $50 t-shirts. You know that one, right? If you don't, you're probably over a certain age. Ask a teenager, they'll explain... and probably ask for $50 for a t-shirt. On second though, don't ask a teenager. Just read on.\n\nThe people who work at American Apparel? All decked in American Apparel clothes. All young. All thin. All good looking. All personally screened by the company's founder. If you don't make the grade, you are sent packing.\n\nAmerican Apparel founder Dov Charney? Let us go down the list: Frequented prostitutes... Masturbated in front of a reporter... Made numerous racist and sexist remarks... To avoid being sued, paid people off with company money... Danced naked in front of female employees... Made an employee his sex slave...\n\nCurrent status of Dov Charney? Fired from American Apparel.\n\nPerhaps he wasn't good looking enough.",
