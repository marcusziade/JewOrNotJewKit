So he made it sure to point out to the president that his is not an Austrian Nobel, it's a Jewish American Nobel. The president asked if something could be done to reconcile. One of Kandel's requests was the renaming of one of Vienna's streets, which was named after an antisemitic former mayor.\n\nIt took a decade, but the street got renamed.
