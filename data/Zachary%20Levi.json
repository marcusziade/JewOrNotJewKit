  "description": "We've heard of Hollywood Jews changing their names to sound more gentile. Hell, it happens all the time. Kirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch. Winona Ryder is really a Horowitz. There are too many others to list.\n\nBut for a Hollywood gentile to change his name to sound more Jewish? Well, that doesn't happen.\n\nOr so we thought.\n\nThe star of \"Chuck\", Zachary Levi. Sounds Jewish, right?\n\nWrong. Zachary was born Zachary Pugh. Levi is his middle name.\n\nSo why would an actor Jewify his name? Is it possible that Zachary was drawn to Judaism?\n\nFat chance. When posed the question, \"where do you get your talent?\", his answer is simple: \"Jesus Christ\".\n\nSo why the change? Well, his agent told him that with the last name Pugh (pronounced \"Pew\"), he won't go far in Hollywood.\n\nWe wonder if the agent was Jewish.",
