Damn your cutaway gags, damn your mortifying Mort Goldman, and damn your torturous use of Mila Kunis.\n\nMost of all, damn your Jewish rumors.\n\nOh, don't get us wrong, we love your Jewish jokes as much as anyone. In fact, the episode when Stewie and Brian go back in time to Nazi Germany is probably our favorite of all time. But do you really have to make stuff up?\n\nSee, Family Guy, because of you, half of America thinks that Bill Nye The Science Guy is Jewish.\n\nAnd we get it. He is pretty nerdy, after all. If you had to pick someone who fits the Jewish stereotype, you could do much worse than Bill Nye. Except that he is, you know, a goy.\n\nOh, and Family Guy? Damn your continued insistence that Disney is antisemitic. But that's a whole other story...",
