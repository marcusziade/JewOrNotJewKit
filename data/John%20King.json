Oh, it turned out more or less OK (the shenanigans that followed were as disgusting as they were doomed to fail), but we're talking about the night itself, when TV networks turned into a never-ending deluge of colored maps and anchors trying to do math in their head... Will this get him to 270? Will this?\n\nFront and center was CNN's John King, a veteran of the election night process. King is Jewish; he converted upon marriage to fellow CNN anchor Dana Bash. The two quickly had a kid... then got divorced. We guess King stayed Jewish afterwards.\n\nKing got a lot of praise for his election night coverage, so good for him. It sure is hard to generate continuous content while waiting for the numbers to come in, especially as election night turned into election week, election month...\n\nYou know what we're not gonna miss about 2020? Everything!",
