  "description": "We need to admit something.\n\nWe like Major League Soccer.\n\nBoy, it feels good to get it off our chest. Let's say it again... we like Major League Soccer. There.\n\nEven when the league's best players leave for the greener pastures of Europe. Even with its penny-pinching salary cap and communistic rules. Even when our beloved MetroStars were gobbled up and turned into the abomination that is Red Bull New York.\n\nStill, it's soccer, it's here in America, most of our World Cup team got it start in MLS, and the level of play gets better every year. And the man who runs it all? Commissioner Don Garber.\n\nWhen Garber took over ten years ago, MLS was barely surviving. Every season was thought to be its last. Now, the league is — if not thriving — succeeding: steady expansion, new stadiums, committed owners. All under Garber's watch.\n\nOh, and he's a Jew.\n\nWe'll gladly admit that.",
