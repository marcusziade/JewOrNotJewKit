  "description": "Dear readers, friends, and family,\n\nWe beg you: please stop sending us forwards.\n\nOh, we get it. You see \"Jewish\" in the title and you think, these guys just MUST see it! Well, guess what? Either we already saw it... or we really don't want to.\n\nTake the most recent forward we got, \"Top 51 hottest Jews\". Oh, we clicked on that one. We just had to! Scarlett Johansson at #1, no? Perhaps Natalie Portman?\n\nTurns out it was \"hottest Jewish men\". So instead of debating Scarlett vs Natalie, we had to scroll through the list that started with Adam Sandler (really?) and went through Daniel Radcliffe, Andy Samberg (are you serious?), Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Liev Schreiber, before ending with Adam Brody at #1.\n\nThat's what we get for all of that, dear readers, friends, and family.  Adam Brody, the kid from \"The O.C.\", somehow judged to be the hottest Jew. No thanks.\n\nIt clearly should have been James Franco.",
