An Israeli one.\n\nNow, we are all for superhero representation, and having an Israeli superhero is nothing to frown at. (And, with Haas, they got a pretty good actress, although one can't think that Marvel missed out on Gal Gadot, who is doing that Wonder Woman thing over at DC.) But here is the problem: that superhero is Sabra.\n\nWe at Jew or Not Jew know a few things about comic books, and let's just say that Sabra is not exactly a top-level hero. And there is that name. Sabra? Honestly, that's about as unimaginative as it gets. What, if Marvel wants an Australian hero, they're gonna call them Ozzy? Canada/Canuck? Germany/Kraut? Russia/Alcoholic? Etc.?\n\nIn any case, nothing wrong with having another Jewish superhero to add to our lineup. But, you know, Marvel, just reboot The Fantastic Four again, have The Thing wear his kippah, and call it a day...",
