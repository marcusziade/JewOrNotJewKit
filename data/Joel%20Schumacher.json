  "description": "\"The lights are coming up after \"Batman Returns\", and it's kids crying, people acting like they've been punched in the stomach.\" â€” Daniel Waters, screenwriter\n\nThis is why, even after \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" were critical and financial successes, director Tim Burton was dumped. (This is back in the 90s, when Burton was hailed as a visionary, and not a Jonny-Depp-obsessed has-been.) In stepped Joel Schumacher. Schumacher was known to be on time, known to be on budget, known to be safe.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\n\"Batman Forever\", followed by \"Batman and Robin\". Two atrocities with awful acting, worse directing, massive plot holes, Chris O'Donnell, and bat nipples. It wasn't just kids who were crying after \"Batman and Robin\".\n\nThat one was so bad that the planned sequel was shelved (Nicolas Cage as Scarecrow?!?!), and Schumacher was sent off to greener pastures. The Batman franchise went to the vault for close to a decade, before it was resurrected by a new visionary, Christopher Nolan.\n\nLet's just hope no one is crying after Zack Snyder's \"Batman v Superman\"...",
