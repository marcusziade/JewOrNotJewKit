  "description": "Oh, the sad state of American tennis...\n\nThe days of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are long gone. Andy Roddick hasn't lived up to expectations. In fact, the highest rated American right now is Mardy Fish, who is not exactly a world-beater. He did win a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics, but, as of this writing, Fish hasn't even sniffed a Grand Slam semifinal.\n\nBut that's alright. Because, according to numerous websites, Fish is Jewish. So hooray for Mardy, the best American tennis player!\n\nNot so fast.\n\nIt looks like the websites are wrong. Even though Mardy was married in a Jewish ceremony, it is his wife, former \"Deal or No Deal\" model Stacey Gardner, who is a Jew. In fact, when Mardy was asked about converting to Judaism, he shrugged the question off.\n\nOh, the sad state of American tennis!",
