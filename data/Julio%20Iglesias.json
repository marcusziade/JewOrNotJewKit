  "description": "Nothing like reaching into the ol' mailbox and see who the readers want us to profile. Ah, here we go. A reader in Virginia wants us to write about Julio Iglesias, \"sexiest man alive!\". Hmmmm.\n\nSexiest man alive? Well, who are we to argue? We might have gone with... ummmm... yeah, who are we to argue? Of course, since we are Jew-centric and all, if our website was to proclaim someone \"sexiest man alive!\", we probably should go with someone Jewish.\n\nAnd — surprise, surprise — Iglesias might be. According to him, his mother has Jewish roots, which makes him Jewish... \"from the waist up\". Settle down, female readers. No, please. We beg you.\n\nSo, Julio Iglesias, somewhat Jewish, \"sexiest man alive!\" But if his father was still with us, he might have had some competition — Julio Sr. married a woman 50 years younger than him and conceived a child at the age of 89... Of course, Julio still has time to catch up.\n\nNow, can our readers ask us to figure out the \"sexiest woman alive!\"? Please?",
