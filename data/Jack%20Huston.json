  "description": "What's our favorite show on TV right now? We're glad you asked.\n\nAs much as we adore Mad Men, we have to go with Boardwalk Empire. HBO's 1920s-set gangster epic is brilliant in every way. Plus, it's set in our home state of New Jersey. So that's nice.\n\nAnd who's our favorite character on Boardwalk Empire? We're glad that you asked once again.\n\nWith all due respect to Steve Buscemi's serpentine Nucky Thompson, and, of course, Michael Stuhlbarg's diabolical Arnold Rothstein, we have to go with Richard Harrow, played by previously-little-known English actor Jack Huston.\n\nHarrow, who... well, we don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the show. Ah, crap. You saw the photo. Yep. Richard Harrow is damn awesome. We're gonna leave it at that.\n\nBut Harrow is not Jewish (if he is, that hasn't been mentioned yet). Yet Huston, the grandson of Oscar-winning director John Huston, does have Jewish heritage on his mother's side. He's actually the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Rothschild dynasty founder Mayer Rothschild.\n\nAren't you glad you asked?",
