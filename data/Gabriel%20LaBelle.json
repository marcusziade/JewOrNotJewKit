  "description": "They made a movie out of Saturday Night Live. No, not a Saturday Night Live movie, those are dime a dozen. A movie about the making of Saturday Night Live; its very first episode, to be exact.\n\nWith it came the meticulous casting of no-names who sort-of look like their SNL counterparts. If you squint just right, this guy named Matt Wood resembles John Belushi! Sort of.\n\nAll of this seems somewhat unnecessary. We know what Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, etc, looked like. We know what they sounded like, behaved like. We don't need to see this cosplay.\n\nFront and center is Gabriel LaBelle, Canadian and Jewish, who plays SNL creator Lorne Michaels, Canadian and Jewish. You might remember LaBelle from his turn as the young Steve Spielberg stand-in in \"The Fabelmans\".\n\nBut what's the alternative? Resurrect Belushi, et al with AI? That's even more terrible!\n\nPerhaps not make this type of movie at all...",
