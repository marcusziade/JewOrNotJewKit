  "description": "The 2019 Oscars came and went without a big brouhaha (unless you want to discuss the various virtues of \"Green Book\" as the Best Picture winner — we don't). With it, came and went the death montage (better known as the \"In Memoriam\" tribute), listing those who passed during the last year.\n\nThe death montage is never without controversy — those who are inexplicably left off. This year, Stanley Donen was somehow forgotten.\n\nWho was Stanley Donen? Only one of Hollywood's most prominent directors of the 1940s and 50s. In fact, you can argue that he directed the most famous (most imitated, most parodied, most iconic) scene in movie history — Gene Kelly singing in the rain in... well, \"Singin' in the Rain\". (Even those of you who've never seen the movie know that scene.)\n\nSo, why was Donen left off? Our guess is because he died three days before the ceremony, and couldn't be edited into the already-prepared montage.\n\nThat said, it took 2600+ profiles for us to get to Donen. What's our excuse?",
