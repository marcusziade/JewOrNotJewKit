  "description": "We've been watching \"Andor\", pleasantly surprised with its quality (considering it's the prequel to \"Rogue One\", the most dreckish of recent Star Wars fare), but one thing kept bothering us...\n\nIs there Scotland in the world of Star Wars?\n\nOf course, both Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor are Scottish, so there have been Scots in Star Wars for a long time. Heck, so is Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles (store that under your hat for next round of trivia!). But \"Andor\", which was partly filmed in Scotland, takes it to the next level. There are prominent, unmistakable Scottish accents left and right.\n\nNow, one might say that there in the Star Wars universe there is an accent that corresponds to Earth's Scottish, but where is the fun in that?\n\nIn any case, not everyone on \"Andor\" is Scottish, but Brits are clearly a majority. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who has a small but pivotal role, is the rare American Jew in the cast.\n\nWhich leads to a more important question...\n\nAre there Jews in the world of Star Wars?",
