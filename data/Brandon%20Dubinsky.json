  "description": "\"Hate\" is a strong word. We use it often, but do we really mean it?\n\nFor example, we say that we hate borscht. Sure, it's a disgusting soup that took its Russian origins and in America somehow became Jewish cuisine. And sure, we wouldn't eat a spoon of it unless we were stuck on a beet-growing desert island. But \"hate\"? Let's just say we strongly dislike borscht.\n\nBut we really do hate the New York Rangers.\n\nAt Jew or Not Jew, we are fans of the New Jersey Devils. And even though our team recently brought home three Stanley Cups, and had their way with their cross-river rivals for much of the past 15 years... we still hate the New York Rangers.\n\nBut herein lies our dilemma. How can we hate the Rangers, when one of their up-and-coming players, Brandon Dubinsky, is often listed as Jewish? We like Jews, right?\n\nThankfully, there is an easy way out. Dubinsky is not Jewish; perhaps the confusion comes from his namesake, former Chicago Blackhawk Steve Dubinsky, who is. But as far as we can tell, there is no relationship between the two; the last name itself, another Russian import, does not hint at any Jewish origins.\n\nWhew. We can go back to hating the Rangers.\n\nAnd borscht. No, seriously, we hate borscht.",
