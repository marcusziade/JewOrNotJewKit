  "description": "Earlier this year, our favorite soccer team, the unfortunately-named New York Red Bulls, signed its fourth-ever Jew (by our count), Omer Damari. He was a gifted forward who appeared for the Israeli national team. We were excited. Damari would get a Jew or Not Jew profile soon enough!\n\nTurns out our excitement should have been curbed. Damari got injured, and never even started a match. He did score one goal, but his short New York career ended with a red card in the playoffs... you know, let's not talk about the playoffs. Let's figure out what is the Jewiest team in the history of Major League Soccer!\n\nAs we said above, New York has had four: Damari is joined by previously-profiled Jeff Agoos, the mostly-irrelevant Jordan Cila, and the miserably-horrible Leo Krupnik. Can anyone top that? MLS has only been playing for 21 years, and the number of Jews is not exactly sky-high. So we want back through the annals to figure out the answer.\n\nIt turns out that New York is topped by one team: the Colorado Rapids. Only four Israelis have ever played in MLS, but two of them suited for Colorado: Guy Melamed and Dedi Ben Dayan. Adding that to American Jews: Cila (who was mostly irrelevant there as well), Kyle Beckerman and Zac MacMath, puts Colorado above the rest.\n\nAnd, look, Damari got his profile!",
