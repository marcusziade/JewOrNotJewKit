  "description": "The Olympics are (finally!) here, so now you're in for a treat(?): we will go down the annals of Summer Olympic history and try to find the best Jew in every sport. We'll only include sports where Jews have medalled in... good luck finding that elusive Jewish badmington champion!(The list has been updated after the Tokyo Olympics.) \n\n\nSport: \n\n(select)\nBaseball\nBasketball\nBeach Volleyball\nBoxing\nCanoe/Kayak\nCycling\nEquestrian\nFencing\nGymnastics\nField Hockey\nJudo\nPolo\nRhythmic Gymnastics\nRowing\nSailing\nShooting\nSoccer\nSwimming\nTaekwondo\nTennis\nTrack \u0026 Field\nVolleyball\nWater Polo\nWrestling\nWeightlifting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt = document.getElementById(\"tit\");\ni = document.getElementById(\"info\");\np = document.getElementById(\"pic\");\nn = document.getElementById(\"pla\");\nd = document.getElementById(\"dat\");\nf = document.getElementById(\"fla\");\nsb = document.getElementById(\"sel\");\nmx = sb.length;\nsb.selectedIndex = 0;\nplayer = new Array(\"\", \"Gavin Fingleson\", \"Sue Bird\", \"Alix Klineman\", \"Jackie Fields\", \"Leon Rotman\", \"Adolf Schmal\", \"Robert Dover\", \"Jeno Fuchs\", \"Agnes Keleti\", \"Carina Benninga\", \"Yael Arad\", \"Edouard de Rothschild\", \"Linoy Ashram\", \"Nathan Cohen\", \"Gal Fridman\", \"Morris Fisher\", \"Arpad Orban\", \"Mark Spitz\", \"Avishag Semberg\", \"Nicolas Massu\", \"Irena Szewinska\", \"Georgy Mondzolevsky\", \"Gyorgy Karpati\", \"Boris Gurevich\", \"Isaac Berger\");\nflags = new Array(\"\", \"AUS\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"ROM\", \"AUT\", \"USA\", \"HUN\", \"HUN\", \"NET\", \"ISR\", \"FRA\", \"ISR\", \"NZL\", \"ISR\", \"USA\", \"HUN\", \"USA\", \"ISR\", \"CHI\", \"POL\", \"URS\", \"HUN\", \"URS\", \"USA\");\nhp = new Array(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1);\ndata = new Array(\n\"\",\n\"We assumed that a major leaguer has won a baseball medal for the US... Nope. The sole Jew to taste Olympic hardware was South-African-born Fingleson, who helped Australia to a silver in 2004. Go figure!\",\n\"A number of Jews have won Olympic basketball medals (including Larry Brown, better known for his coaching), but only one has won multiples: Bird. She has led the US women to its last FIVE gold medals, as dominating a team performance as ever seen in the games.\",\n\"We originally gave this to Adriana Behar of Brazil, who won two silvers. But after Tokyo, how could we not switch it to all 6'5'' of Klineman, who lost just one set on her way to gold with partner April Ross.\",\n\"Believe it or not, there are quite a few Jewish boxing medalists, including multiple gold winners. We're choosing Jackie Fields, who won a rare double: Olympic featherweight gold in 1924 and a professional world title.\",\n\"Can you imagine kneeling in a canoe and rowing for 10 kilometers? The Olympics can't either, removing the event after Rotman won it in 1956. The Romanian also got a gold and a bronze from the still-contested 1K race. Also, let's not forget the mother-daughter medal-winning pair of Miryam Fox-Jerusalmi and Jessica Fox. The latter won four medals, including a gold.\",\n\"An easy selection here, as Jews have only had one cycling medalist: Schmal, who took one gold and two bronzes in the inaugural modern Olympics in 1896. The gold came in the fantastical 12-hour road race... there were only two finishers. Schmal also fenced, finishing fourth.\",\n\"Do we pick Dover, who competed in dressage in six different Olympics, and won four bronzes between 1992 and 2004, or Neal Shapiro, who jumped to a silver and a bronze in his solitary Games in 1972? Does it really matter? Nice hat.\",\n\"Jews actually have had a spectacularly surprising fencing history. Belgian, Russian, Danish, American, British, Austrian, Swedish, French, and German Jews have all medalled, but Hungary's Jewish fencing tradition is unmatched. So we'll go with Fuchs, who won four golds (two individual, two team) in sabre at the 1908 and 1912 Games.\",\n\"Gymnast Alfred Flatow was the first Jewish Olympic medalist. We have had a number of all-around champions, including Maria Gorokhovskaya and Elena Shushunova. And who can forget Aly Raisman, delighting audiences in the 2010s! Keleti's ten medals reign supreme: she took five golds, three silvers, and two bronzes for Hungary in 1952 and 1956.\",\n\"Carina Benniga won a gold for the Netherlands in 1984 and followed with a bronze for years later. In those Seoul Olympics, she was matched with a bronze by her brother Marc.\",\n\"Of Israel's nine medals prior to Tokyo, five have come in judo. The first, a silver, was earned by Arad in 1992. It was the first ever medal for the tiny country... and still the only silver, as the rest have been bronzes. Still, it's clear that Israeli know their judo. If only krav maga was an Olympic sport...\",\n\"The Olympics might have forgotten about polo 80 years ago, but we haven't. Rothschild (yes, of \u003ci\u003ethose\u003c/i\u003e Rothschilds) helped France to a bronze in 1900. With rugby and golf coming back, who knows, maybe we'll see the return of polo?\",\n\"Who doesn't love rhythmic gymnastics: the grace, the pageantry, the glitter, the ribbons!? We don't, that's who. But Israel's Linoy Ashram won the all-around gold in Tokyo, so we need to celebrate that, right? Why is this a sport?\",\n\"Bob Moch was the coxswain for the gold-winning American eights in 1936. Nathan Cohen of New Zealand was a double sculls gold medalist in 2012. With all respect to Moch, we'll go with Cohen: he actually \u003ci\u003erowed\u003c/i\u003e.\",\n\"New Zealand's Jo Aleh added a silver in Rio to go with a gold from London. But she has to take a backseat to Gal Fridman, Israel's FIRST EVER gold medalist. Fridman won a gold in Athens to add to his bronze from Atlanta. Israel has another sailing medal, with Shahar Tzuberi taking bronze in Beijing.\",\n\"Jews are not exactly good at shooting, with very few medalists through Olympic history. Fisher is the one obvious exception: five golds between the 1920 and 1924 Games.\",\n\"We wish we could select Germany's Gottfried Fuchs, who scored 10 goals against Russia in 1912. Alas, that came in a consolation game, so Fuchs didn't medal. We will go with the Hungarian defender Orban, who started every game in helping his country to the gold in 1964.\",\n\"Many, many to choose from here, including recent champs Lenny Krayzelburg and Anthony Ervin. Dara Torres actually has the most medals, 12, but it's impossible to argue against Spitz. He has 11, nine of them gold, seven of them coming in 1974, each in a world-record-breaking performance. He is not just the best Jewish Olympian ever, he is one of the best Olympians ever, period.\",\n\"This profile was published on the eve of the Tokyo Olympics, when no Jew had ever come close to a takewondo medal... Come on, taekwondo!? Literally a day later, Israel's Avishag Semberg won the bronze. Come on, taekwondo!\",\n\"With apologies to Italy's bronze medalist in 1924, the terrifically named Baron Uberto Luigi De Morpurgo, the clear selection is Chile's Massu, who got a rare double in 2004. Massu took gold in both the singles and doubles tournament in Athens.\",\n\"Poland's Szewinska medalled in four Olympics, from 1964 to 1976, some under her maiden name of Kirszenstein. Once the world's fastest woman, her totals stand at three golds, two silvers, and two bronzes. Honorable mention to Tamara Press of the USSR, who got three golds and a silver in shot put and discus.\",\n\"We watched a lot of volleyball during the last Olympics, and thought: This is great! We need to watch more international volleyball, whenever it's on. That was a lie. We haven't watched any volleyball since. In any case, Mondzolevsky won two golds for the Soviets, in 1964 and 1968.\",\n\"Hungary has been a water polo power throughout history, at one point medalling at 12 straight Games. The team featured a number of Jews, including Karpati, who won three golds and a bronze between 1952 and 1964.\",\n\"Do we go with Boris Gurevich, who won a Greco-Roman gold for the Soviets in 1952, or Boris Gurevich, who won a freestyle gold for the Soviets in 1968? Your guess is as good as ours.\",\n\"If things worked out differently, Berger might have been Israel's first-ever medalist, as he was born in Jerusalem before moving to the US as a child. He won a gold in 1956 and followed with bronzes in the next two Olympics.\"\n);\nox = 0;\nfunction load(x) {\n  ox = x;\n  //t.innerHTML = '';\n  i.style.display = 'block';\n  n.innerHTML = player[x];\n  d.innerHTML = data[x];\n  f.src = 'img/other/oly/'+flags[x]+'.gif';\n  loadPic(x);\n}\nfunction choose() {\n  x = sb.selectedIndex;\n  if (x != 0) load(x);\n}\nfunction next() {\n  x = ox + 1;\n  if (x \u003e= mx) x = 1;\n  sb.selectedIndex = x;\n  load(x);\n}\nfunction loadPic(x) {\n  who = player[x];\n  who = who.replace(/ /g, '_').toLowerCase();\n  w0 = who.charAt(0);\n  src = 'img/people/' + w0 + '/' + who + '.jpg';\n  if (hp[x] == 0) src = 'img/other/oly/' + who + '.jpg';\n  p.src = src;\n}\n/*\nArchery\nBadminton\nDiving\nGolf\nHandball\nModern Pentathlon\nMountain Biking\nSynchronized Swimming\nTable Tennis\nTaekwando\nTrampoline\nTriathlon\n*/",
