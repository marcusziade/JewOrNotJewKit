  "description": "People have been telling us to watch the supposedly funny \"I Think You Should Leave\", Tim Robinson's sketch comedy show, so we did, and one thing struck us immediately: Robinson's rather massive nose.\n\nHaving become experts in Jewish noses over the years (such is the lot of running this website), that one did not exactly strike us as Hebrew. It's not; Robinson comes from Italian stock. But looking up the comedian's ancestry opened an interesting sidestory where he claimed that he \"grew up with two dads\" after his parents divorced. And one of those dads was Jewish.\n\nOption 1: \"My Two Dads\" situation, just like the 80s sitcom with Paul Reiser, with Tim not knowing who his true father is. We're going to dismiss that.\n\nOption 2: Tim's biological father turned out to be homosexual, and Tim lived in a household with two male parents, one of them Jewish. More common today, but not impossible.\n\nOption 3: Tim's mom re-married a Jew, and Tim considers him one of his two dads. Without any further evidence, this seems the most logical choice.\n\nOption 4: We think they call it a... menage a trois? You know, let's just move on that and end with our thoughts on \"I Think You Should Leave\".\n\nMostly unfunny.",
