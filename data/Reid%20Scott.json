  "description": "How do you tell a wiener from a weiner? It's questions like these that keep you coming back to Jew or Not Jew!\n\nA \"wiener\" is something that comes from Wien: Vienna, Austria. That's where you get your wiener schnitzel, you wiener dog, and your wiener wurst (sausage; in America, just shortened to \"wiener\").\n\nA \"weiner\" comes from Yiddish \"vayner\", or wine merchant. (Alright, it can also come from a regional German word for wainwright, someone who makes carts. We're not talking about German weiners.) You rarely see these weiners outside of a someone's last name, although sometimes they are accidentally mixed with wieners.\n\nWith all those wieners and weiners, can you blame actor Reid Scott Weiner (you might have seen him in \"Veep\" or the \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\") from chopping off his Weiner last name and just becoming Reid Scott?\n\nNo, you can't.",
