  "description": "Last Saturday, we watched Simone Biles do her thing on the vault and were amazed and terrified. Amazed, because what Biles can do is other-worldly. Terrified, because we had a thought about attempting vaulting ourselves. Best case scenario is a broken neck. (It's not just vault, natch. Pick your gymnastics apparatus and throw you average human in there. It doesn't end well.)\n\nEarlier that day, we watched windsurfing. (In case you can't tell, we've been watching A LOT of these Olympics!)\n\nThere were two finals that day, and Israeli Jews were involved in each. First, Sharon Kantor took the silver. Then, Tom Reuveny got the gold. (Since we were not gonna write TWO windsurfing profiles, he gets the headline. Sorry, Sharon!) Our thoughts? No, not amazement or terror.\n\nHere were Sharon and Tom, zipping around the water on a little board with a sail. Wee! Wee! Now, we're not saying it's easy by any stretch of imagination, but it definitely looked enjoyable! It looked like fun!\n\nOh. Olympic windsurfers are required to wear helmets and impact vests to protect themselves from potential danger.\n\nScratch the fun part.\n\nfunction flip() {\n remember();\n}\nfunction flip2() {\n memorize();\n setImage('sharon_kantor');\n setRatings(4, 4, 4);\n setTitle('Sharon Kantor');\n setSubhead('January 28, 2003 -');\n}",
