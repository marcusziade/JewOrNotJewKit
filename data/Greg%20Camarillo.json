  "description": "Welcome to cold, heartless Minnesota, where promising Jewish NFL careers come to die.\n\nFirst, there was offensive tackle Mike Rosenthal, a starter with the New York Giants who signed with the Vikings. He got injured after a  year, came back, lost his starting job, and was out of football soon after.\n\nThen, there was somewhat Jewish quarterback Sage Rosenfels, who came up with Miami, put up big numbers in Houston, and then got traded to Minnesota. But with the Vikings, he never saw the field because of the acquisition of the gun-slinging, croc-wearing, interception-throwing, jeans-selling, lover-of-women, not-Jewish, Brett Favre. Rosenfels was traded to the Giants after a season in Minnesota.\n\nAnd now there's wide receiver Greg Camarillo. Yes, Camarillo is a surprising Jew, coming from a half goyishe, half Jewish family. With Miami, Camarillo was a starter and put up respectable numbers for two seasons. Now with the Vikings, he's been relegated to spot duty and rarely sees the field.\n\nWell, one thing for Camarillo to do. Pray for a trade back to the Dolphins or perhaps the Giants. Miami and New York just make more sense on every level, don't they?",
