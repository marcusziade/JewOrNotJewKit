  "description": "\"All this time I thought I was a self-loathing Jew, when all along I was just a plain old antisemite.\" â€” Krusty the Clown\n\nHey hey kids! It's Krusty the Clown, everyone's favorite animated harlequin, host of his own TV show, peddler of various shady products, gambling-addicted alcoholic, friend of Bette Midler and Johnny Carson. And a Jew, as we found out in one of the earliest memorable episodes, when Krusty tried to reconnect with his estranged rabbi father Hyman Krustofski.\n\nOf course, being a Jew does not stop Krusty from hosting \"Krusty Kinda Khristmas\" and having his own brand of pork products. So he truly is the definition of \"self-loathing Jew\". Or is it just \"plain old antisemite\"?\n\nWe'll still take him over Chief Wiggum, Waylon Smithers, or Barney Gumble any day of the week.",
