Did you know that he has also won a major international championship? As well as an Olympic medal? No?\n\nDid you know that the last team he coached, Maccabi Tel Aviv, was a huge underdog that became the champion of Europe? Did you know that he has won 17 different titles on various levels? No?\n\nDid you know that he is American who coached the Russian national basketball team? Did you know the Russians actually loved having an American in charge? No?\n\nDid you know that he is Jewish? No?\n\nWell, he was just named the coach of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. So we guess you'll find out soon enough.\n\n(Editor's update: It didn't exactly work out.)",
