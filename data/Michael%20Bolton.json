Nagheenanajar.\nMichael: Yeah, well at least your name isn't Michael Bolton.\nSamir: You know there's nothing wrong with that name.\nMichael: There was nothing wrong with it... until I was about 12 years old and that no-talent ass clown became famous and started winning Grammys.\n\nSadly for him, the character in \"Office Space\" has to share his name with Michael Bolton. But he's fictional; we're not too worried about him.\n\nSadly for us, we have to share our Jewishness with Michael Bolton. Ugh.\n\nWell, at least he has trimmed his mullet. We guess that's a start. He still has to work on that no-talent ass clown thing, though.",
