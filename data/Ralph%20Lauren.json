  "description": "We at JONJ tend to look down a little on people who change their names to sound less ethnic. After all, we have very ethnic names and they haven't kept us from fame and fortune... But we digress.\n\nIn any case, though, sometimes we can understand the need to change one's name. Because as much of a global success (and 100% Jew) Ralph Lauren is, would it still be that way if his brand was called Ralph Lifshitz?\n\n\"Oh, is that the new Ralph Lifshitz? It's divine!\"\n\n\"It's Mandy's birthday, so I bought her a new Lifshitz sweater.\"\n\n\"The latest designs from the Lifshitz house of ideas were unveiled today.\"\n\nWell, you get the idea. Seriously, Ralph. Good call.",
