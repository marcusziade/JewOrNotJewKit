  "description": "We used to really like Ben Stein. From \"Ferris Bueller\" to \"The Wonder Years\" to \"Win Ben Stein's Money\", the one-time Nixon speechwriter turned himself into quite a Renaissance man.\n\nBut why on earth is he the front man for the Christian fundamentalist movie \"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\"?\n\nSure, Ben can have his beliefs. Creationism might be illogical on every level, but he is free to believe what he wants. And he can use his celebrity to spread his message. G-d knows he won't be the first. But... Christian fundamentalists? Really? We gotta draw the line here.\n\nSorry, Ben. Your score, which we originally thought was going to be really high, is gonna take a hit. Call us when your next movie is a Ferris Bueller sequel, maybe we'll reconsider.",
