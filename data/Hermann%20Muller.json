  "description": "If comic books taught us anything, is that we need to avoid x-rays. How many superheroes (and supervillians!) were created by accidental exposure to radiation?\n\nOf course, that's true in real life as well. There is one major difference: you shouldn't expect radiation to give you superpowers. Sure, having a third arm might be useful when scratching your back, but... no. Just no.\n\nX-ray mutagenesis was discovered by H. J. Muller in the 1940s. He got a Nobel for his effort... and then spent the rest of his life campaigning against nuclear testing.\n\nMakes sense, doesn't it? We don't want our world to turn into a comic book, right?",
