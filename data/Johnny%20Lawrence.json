  "description": "In a profile of our favorite movie mom, Karate Kid's Randee Heller, we suggested that Daniel LaRusso just might be half Jewish. And while we will not abandon that theory, perhaps we should have looked across the mat at Johnny Lawrence. Make that... Johnny Weinberg?\n\nIt should come as no secret that we absolutely adore Cobra Kai, the sequel series to The Karate Kid. It has no right to be so good, and yet it is. And front is center is the original's enemy, Johnny (no, not really Weinberg) Lawrence, turned from a scumbag into a redemption story. More or less. He's still got some scumbag in him.\n\nSo what the Weinberg? Johnny is given a backstory, which involves his mom remarrying an older, rich Hollywood executive named Sid Weinberg. And while it's not implicitly stated that he is Jewish, come on! A rich Hollywood executive played by Ed Asner named Weinberg? That's a Jew!\n\nNow, Johnny never changed his name after his mom remarried, and appears to be Christian... which is just as well. The implications that the antagonist from The Karate Kid could have possibly been Jewish?\n\nThe protagonist from Cobra Kai? Oh, we'd take him!\n\nw = false;\nfunction flip() {\n w = !w;\n setTitleOnly(w ? \"Johnny Weinberg\" : \"Johnny Lawrence\");\n}",
