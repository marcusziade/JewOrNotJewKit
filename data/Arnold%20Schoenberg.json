He even changed the song title of \"Moses und Aaron\" to \"Moses und Aron\", because the former contained 13 letters.\n\nAnd then, as he got older, it got worse. An astrologer told Schoenberg to watch out not just for 13, but for numbers whose digits add up to 13... Such as 76, his age in 1951. The composer got so obsessed with the number that it led to depression... and death. On July 13th. You couldn't make this stuff up.\n\nPerhaps he should have been afraid of coincidences...",
