  "description": "You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind; a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination â€” \n\nNext stop, the Jew Zone.\n\nPicture if you will, a young, talented man from Upstate New York. An intelligent, creative young man, he is haunted by his experiences in World War II. Then, in the 1960s, he invents a television program called the \"Twilight Zone\" that uses science fiction stories to convey his personal beliefs about society, religion, and more.\n\nThe upbringing, the background, the science fiction: all the evidence would lead you to the conclusion that Rod Serling is a Jew. And you'd be right, except...\n\nHe became a Unitarian. \n\nIt's the kind of twist ending that gives you chills just thinking about it, doesn't it?",
