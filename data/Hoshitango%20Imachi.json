  "description": "What's the coolest thing we could tell you today? What could you learn that will stick in your brain for weeks and demand to be shared with friends and family? That you will think about in 20 years and still think, wow, you know what? That's pretty damn cool!\n\nHowabout this? Since Back to the Future takes place in 1985 and Marty McFly travels back to 1955, if the movie were made today he would be traveling back to 1983! Ok... no... That's just depressing. \n\nOk, let's try this on for size. Crows are really super smart. They use tools, are capable, in fact, of using one tool to make/acquire another tool (something not even primates do). Crows use language, have over 250 unique calls, have a shouting voice and a conversation voice, can remember dangers for over two years, and are capable of sharing knowledge with their offspring!\n\nYeah, that's pretty neat. But unless you're really into crows, it's not exactly getting your heart going. Can we do better?\n\nYes. Yes, we can. Because that guy over there? The one in the picture? He's a professional sumo wrestler. In fact, in the 1980s, Imachi was able to reach the second highest level of sumo in Japan. Which doesn't happen that often for an Argentinian. And which never happens for a Jew.\n\nThat's right, Hoshitango Imachi is an Argentinian, Jewish, sumo wrestler. And that's probably the coolest thing you'll learn for a long, long time.",
