  "description": "What's an oxymoron? It's a figure of speech that is a contradiction on its surface. Plastic silverware is a rather common example. Climb down. Virtual reality. Military intelligence (copyright George Carlin).\n\nJewish rapper? Not so much! As we've detailed numerous times, Jews practically invented rap. (We kid, we kid.) Plus, you know, Drake.\n\nRussian rapper? Sadly, not an oxymoron. There are Russians who rap. They are really not good at it, but it doesn't stop them from trying. (So much for hating the decadent American culture!)\n\nRussian Jewish rapper? Well, there is at least one. His name is Miron Fedorov, but he goes by... Oxxxymiron. You see where this was going?\n\nMiron has a few things in his favor: he is proudly Jewish, his first album was called \"Wandering Jew\", he is supposedly good (we will take our readers' word for it), and he is vehemently against Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, donating his recent proceeds to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nGood Russian? In this case, definitely not an oxymoron.",
