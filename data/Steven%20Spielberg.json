  "description": "He hasn't made a good movie in five years.\n\nHe keeps putting out stinkers like Artificial Intelligence, associating with meshuggenahs like Tom Cruise, and even shook his strongest supporters with Munich, considered by some to be anti-Israeli.\n\nSo how does Steven Spielberg get a perfect score?\n\nIt's not our fanboy fascination with the Indiana Jones movies or our ardent affection for summer blockbusters like Jurassic Park and E.T. No, it all comes down to two words: \n\nSchindler's List.\n\nOnce you make a movie like that, you get the Jew or Not Jew equivalent of a get out of jail free card. \n\nOh, wait, two more words:\n\nIndiana Jones.\n\nDuh.",
