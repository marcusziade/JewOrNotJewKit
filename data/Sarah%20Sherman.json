  "description": "You won, JONJ audience. We finally watched that Adam Sandler Netflix movie. No, not that one. We're not watching that dreck. The very Jewy Adam Sandler Netflix movie. Yes, that one!\n\nThe one with Sandler's daughter. (She plays Sandler's daughter.) And the other Sandler's daughter. (She plays Sandler's other daughter.) And Sandler's wife. (She plays... Sandler's daughter's friend's mom. Bet you didn't see that one coming! Sandler's movie wife is played by a real actress, Idina Menzel, who also played Sandler's wife in \"Uncut Gems\", which is a completely different movie, but is also very Jewy. Where we we?) The one with Steve Buscemi's... brother.\n\nYes, so that movie, which takes place in a magical world where everyone is Jewish (Even the hot kids! Even the Asians!), or, at the minimal, is married to someone Jewish or is trying to convert to Judaism. (So... Livingston, New Jersey?) You know, we don't need to recap the plot. You're not there for the plot. All you need to know that it's called \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\". It's all right there in the title. Feel free to fill in your storyline, we're pretty sure you will not be far off.\n\nStill, we laughed a couple of times, and it's not the worst way to spend a lazy afternoon. And it's not like we're gonna have a problem picking a Jew from the cast to headline the profile... We're gonna go with Sarah Sherman, who plays Rabbi Rebecca. (Of course there's a Rabbi Rebecca.) The comedian known as Sarah Squirm has spent the last few years on SNL.\n\nWe haven't watched that dreck in years!",
