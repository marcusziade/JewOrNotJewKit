  "description": "We're not sure if we want to kvell about Lilia Akhaimova.\n\nOn one hand, we usually kvell about Olympians, especially Olympic medalists, and especially Olympic gold medalists. And Akhaimova is just that, winning the team gold in gymnastics in Tokyo.\n\nOn the other hand, she won it for Russia (make that the Russian Olympic Committee), and while we have nothing against Russia per se (alright; we do), the fact that they had to compete as that \"Olympic Committee\" because of a nationwide cheating program (which, face it, is probably still going on, just in another lab), is, well...\n\nOn the third hand, we are not exactly sure she is even Jewish. Yes, her surname tends to be Jewish, and yes, the Israeli press has claimed her, and yes, you will not find that schnoz on a regular goyishe Russian girl (seriously, look at that SCHNOZ!), but we really can't go above \"Borderline Jew\", and it's kinda iffy at that.\n\nSo, some kvelling? Just not too much.",
