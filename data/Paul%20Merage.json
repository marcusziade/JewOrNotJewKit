Yes, the turnovers you microwave in a paper sleeve. A billion dollars!\n\nFor those who never had a Hot Pocket... you are truly missing out! There are so many flavors to choose from! Here are a few:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the classic ham and cheese... or, as they call it here, Ham \u0026 Cheddar. No, obviously not Kosher. This milquetoast monstrosity should be only consumed by goyim.
