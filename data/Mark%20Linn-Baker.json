  "description": "Why did Mark Linn-Baker change his name? Err, you know... Mark Linn-Baker? No?\n\nThe star of \"Perfect Strangers\"? The semi-popular show from the early 90s that some misguided souls remember lovingly today? No, not Balki, that was Bronson Pinchot. Mark Linn-Baker played Cousin Larry. Ring a bell? No?\n\nIf not, you might remember Mark Linn-Baker from... well, you won't. He's worked steadily for the past three decades, but nothing comes close the the 150 episodes of dreck known as \"Strangers\". There are worse careers, we guess.\n\nSo, why did he change his name? No, it's not to hide his Jewishness; that came from his mother's side. Really, we have no idea.\n\nWhat we can inform you is the name he changed it from. Mark Linn-Baker used to be... Mark-Linn Baker.\n\nWe don't get it either.",
