  "description": "Enough is enough. We're at the point where JONJ is dominating our lives so much... well, let us explain.\n\nWe recently got a suggestion to profile Michelle Trachtenberg. She's an a young actress, rather pleasant-looking, was on Buffy, in Eurotrip... Nothing exactly earth-shattering, and not exactly an A-lister. But she was suggested, so we took note... oh did we ever.\n\nThe next night, we had a dream. It was about Michelle. No... it's not what you think. In the dream, we asked her if she was Jewish. We know her father is, we're not so sure about the Russian-born mother... And then that goyishe middle name Christine...\n\nAnd here's the biggest problem: we don't remember her response!\n\nEnough is enough. JONJ has gotten to be a bit too much. Oh, sure, it was fine when it was taking up much of our waking hours, but when it starts popping up in our dreams? We gotta do something about it. Take a short break. Go outside once in a while. Concentrate on our real jobs. Wipe out the suggestion box. Go a week without writing a profile...\n\nOh, who are we kidding!",
