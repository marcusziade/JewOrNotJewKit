  "description": "\"Scarface\" Al Capone. \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. Nicknames that send shivers down one's spine. Tommy Lucchese, AKA \"Three-Fingers Brown\". Meyer \"Mob's Accountant\" Lansky. Albert \"Mad Hatter\" Anastasia.\n\nWait, what was that one again? Meyer \"Mob's Accountant\" Lansky? OK...\n\nWell, he might not have had his face slashed like Capone, and he might have not gunned down as many as Kelly, but as far as mobsters are concerned, Meyer Lansky was up there. He started in bootlegging, moved on to gambling, and in process, stashed away millions â€” some stay billions. Lansky established gambling empires in Miami and New Orleans, and attempted to turn Cuba into a mobster's haven (he was the basis for Hyman Roth in \"Godfather II\").\n\nAnd when the times got tough, what did Lansky try to do? Try to run to... Israel, only to be deported back two years later.\n\nYep, Meyer Lansky was Jewish. Now that nickname makes a tad more sense, doesn't it?",
