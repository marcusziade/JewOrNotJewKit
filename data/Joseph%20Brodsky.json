  "description": "We don't like to give out the perfect 5/5/5 score here on JONJ too often. Not that there aren't many deserving candidates, but we like to keep the club exclusive. So more often than not, even if someone might be deserving of a 15, we knock them down to a 14. It's our website after all. We make the rules.\n\nSo here we have Joseph Brodsky. Russian dissident. American Poet Laureate. Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature in 1987. And clearly, obviously Jewish; when asked, \"Who are you, an American or a Russian?\", he answered: \"I am Jewish â€” a Russian poet and an English essayist.\" So how can we not give out the perfect score here?\n\nYou see, Brodsky was buried in an Episcopalian cemetery.\n\nHe might have been 15/15 in life... In death, 14/15 is the best we can do.",
