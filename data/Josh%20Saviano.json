  "description": "Today, on When Jewish Kid Stars Go Bad...\n\nYou heard the story of the two Coreys... Now revel in the misery that is Josh Saviano!\n\nOne day, he is starring on an award-winning, beloved television show. He is Paul Pfeiffer, the Jewish best friend to Fred Savage's Kevin Arnold on \"The Wonder Years\". Everything is beyond fantastic. Josh has legions of fans. Directors are lining up to give him starring roles. There is talk of a Paul Pfeiffer spin-off. And then...\n\nPoof!\n\nSaviano disappears. Into nothingness.\n\nWhat happened? Why did a successful child star choose to leave it all behind?\n\nNo one knows for sure. There was hearsay that he grew up to be Marilyn Manson, but it turned out to be just a rumor. All we can confirm is that today Saviano is a successful lawyer. Oh, the misery that must be his life!\n\nNext week on When Jewish Kid Stars Go Bad... Dustin Diamond! We'll definitely be back to form on that one.",
