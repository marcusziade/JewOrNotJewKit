You spend your time doing your makeup, reading romance novels, needle-pointing... whatever it is that young women did at the time.\n\nYou have night visions. The same ones, time and again. These are angels, you tell yourself.\n\nThese angels take fiery spears of gold and thrust them into you. They pull them out and leave you on fire. Your words, not ours.\n\nYou feel pain, but the pain is sweet. You moan. A lot. You feel ecstatic. So ecstatic that you can't wait for their return.\n\nThese are not just angels, you tell yourself. This is Jesus Christ himself, in bodily form.\n\nYou are made a saint for your suffering in the name of Jesus. \"The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa\", they call it.\n\nWe bet your nightly visitor never got close to sanctification...",
