  "description": "What was the first state to elect a practicing Jew as its governor?\n\nNew York would be a good guess. Lots of Jews live there.\n\nWhat about Florida? That's Jew Heaven for some.\n\nMaybe Rhode Island? They built the first American synagogue there. Or New Jersey?\n\nAlaska? That's a maverick state that could go in such an unorthodox direction?\n\nNo, no, no, no, and no. Would you believe Idaho?\n\nYes, Idaho. The land of potatoes. And here we thought the next Jew to call Idaho home would be the first.\n\nInterestingly, the man in question, Moses Alexander, had no plans to stay in Idaho. He was en route to Alaska, stopped in Boise, opened a clothing store, built a synagogue, was elected mayor, and then became governor in 1915.\n\nThe first and last Jewish governor of Idaho, we're willing to bet.",
