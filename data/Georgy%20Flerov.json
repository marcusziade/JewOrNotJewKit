  "description": "How does one become a scientific immortal? Winning a Nobel is nice and everything, but they give out a bunch of those every year. Having a law or theorem named after you is great, but who can keep track of them all...\n\nHow about having lending your name to an element? Yeah, that's top notch.\n\nEvery time a new element is discovered, a fevered argument begins over its name. Now, obviously all these new elements are highly radioactive, exist for miniscule moments, and are only of theoretical value. But when one pops up, a nerd fight for the ages ensues.\n\nWhich brings us to Element 114. The Russians who discovered it wanted to name it after scientist Gregory Flerov, who played a large role in building the Soviet atomic bomb. Some others didn't like that, so officially 114 is named after... the Flerov Laboratory (which, in turn, is named after the same Flerov), an international nuclear research center. Talk about nerd fights.\n\nIn any case, add flevorium to einsteinum, bohrium, and meitnerium to the exclusive list of elements named after Jews. Not a bad group of scientific immortals!",
