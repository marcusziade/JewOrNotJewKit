  "description": "For centuries, one of the main things that made Jews stand out was our ability to laugh at ourselves (in fact, one could say that's the whole point of this website). Jews have made self-deprecation an art form. And who does it better today than Larry David?\n\nHe first gave us \"Seinfeld\", where he was the man behind the scenes (and many fans of the show will agree that it went downhill after his departure). He gave us George Costanza, one of the best characters in the history of television. And now he has given us \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\".\n\nNot everyone likes \"Curb\"; people find the show and David's portrayal of himself rude, annoying, narcissistic, and unlikable. But most of these people need a laughtrack to guide their emotions. Regardless of your opinion of the show, one can't deny David's Jewishness on it; from accidentally stopping a Baptism, to eating the Jesus cookie (\"I thought he was a monkey!\"), to (falsely) finding out he was adopted and haplessly trying to act as a goy.\n\nIn the end, David's portrayal of himself is as self-deprecating as it gets. Which, we suppose, makes him as Jewish as he can get. Perhaps he's this millennium's Woody Allen â€” less appreciated, but also far less creepy. It's the kind of left-handed compliment that only someone like David himself could enjoy.",
