Unfortunately, there already was a Michael Douglas, so the second Michael Douglas became Michael Keaton... but this is not about Michael Douglas.\n\nThis is about David Cohen.\n\nDavid Cohen is best known as the co-creator of the oft-beloved Futurama. In that capacity, he is known as David X. Cohen. You see, as far as Jewish names go, \"David Cohen\" is as generic as it gets. And there are many, many Jews in Hollywood...\n\nThere are cinematographers named David Cohen. There are composers, producers, cameramen, editors.... There are literally dozens of actors. And there are many, many, writers. Including, unfortunately for Futurama's David Cohen, a man named David S. Cohen, whose main contribution is a writing credit on an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nYou see, Futurama's David SAMUEL Cohen couldn't even use his own middle initial! So he picked \"X\", which he called \"easy to remember and debatably cool\".\n\nHeck, it got him a profile on our site! As opposed to all the other David Cohens...",
