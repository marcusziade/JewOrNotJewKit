  "description": "Thanks to the great New Jersey public school system, we learned a lot about our nation's founding fathers.\n\nTake Alexander Hamilton. He was the first Secretary of Treasury, and he was killed in a duel, and... he's on the 10 dollar bill, and...\n\nHere's what they didn't teach us in school: Hamilton was born on the Caribbean island of Nevis. His goyishe mother left her husband, Johann Michal Lavien (rumored, but not proven, Jewish), shacked up with Scotsman James Hamilton (Not a Jew), and bore Alexander out of wedlock.\n\nSo when it was time for young Alex to go to school, the Anglican church would have none of that. So what did his parents do? That's right, they enrolled Alex in a private Jewish school. (If you ever needed more proof that Jews were ALWAYS more tolerant than the goyim!)\n\nYou can just picture young Alex, wearing a yarmulke and breeches (they wore breeches at the time, right?), dipping his quill into the inkwell, careful as to avoid an inkblot on that impossible letter shin... (They didn't teach pistol shooting at that school, that's for sure.)\n\nSadly, Hamilton's immersion in Judaism did not go farther than his primary education. But if anything, it taught him tolerance. \"[The] progress of the Jews,\" he wrote, \"from their earliest history to the present time has been and is entirely out of the ordinary course of human affairs.\"\n\nWhy didn't they teach us THAT in school?",
