  "description": "With all the Jewish comedians out there, one would expect many Jews to have appeared as cast members on Saturday Night Live. Strangely, that is not so.\n\nSure, we got Gilda Radner, Billy Crystal, and Jon Lovitz. (Hooray!) Yes, there is Adam Sandler. (Hooray?) But after that... Laraine Newman? Not exactly a household name. And... we're drawing a blank. Rachel Dratch? Pardon us for not getting excited about her.\n\nChevy Chase? No. Bill Murray? No. John Belushi, Eddie Murphy, Phil Hartman, Dennis Miller, Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Chris Farley, Norm Macdonald, Will Ferrell... Really, anyone worth a damn, and... No.\n\nSo we have to settle for half-Jews of various quality, such as Maya Rudolph, Rob Schneider, and Chris Kattan. CHRIS Kattan? Half-Jewish? CHRIS Kattan? Really?\n\nMaybe someone should research Bill Murray's ancestry?",
