  "description": "Somehow, we remember reading a mid-90s Sports Illustrated article about a college football coach who converted from Judaism to Christianity. Help us, Intertubes!\n\nWe quickly found the answer. The coach in question is Fred Goldsmith, who went all goy after seeing Billy Graham speak. His parents were pretty pissed. In the mid-90s, Goldsmith coached Duke...\n\nWait a minute! There was a Sports Illustrated article about a Duke football coach? (For those who don't follow college sports, Duke is great at basketball, awful at football.)\n\nTurns out that Duke somehow started its 1994 season undefeated, which led to Goldsmith being written up. It didn't exactly turn out too well: Duke ended that year on a losing streak, and then turned in four straight losing campaigns (including a winless season), leading to Goldsmith's firing.\n\nIn fact, Goldsmith is now most remembered for his role in the scandal involving Heather Sue Mercer, a woman who wanted to play at Duke. Apparently, Goldsmith promised her a spot on the team, then reneged, telling her to try beauty pageants and cheerleading instead.\n\nHe's all yours, goyim.",
