  "description": "Good morning and welcome to the Critic's Corner!\n\nToday, we're gonna review the Gene-ius behind The Today Show's movie reviews. Shal-l we get started?\n\nOn second thought, let's not. You see, we were gonna fill this profile with terrible, terrible puns, like the two above. We were gonna \"bow\" down to his choice of wardrobe (for Shalit loves wearing those bow ties), talk about his \"hair-raising\" presence (because of his, you know, raised hair), and then throw something in there about how he \"handles\" something or other (the handlebar mustache. Terrible, terrible puns).\n\nBut we're gonna spare our readers. For they don't come to our website to see us butcher the English language. For that, they could just listen to Shalit's movie reviews. He's been doing it for close to 40 years, after all, one terrible pun after another.\n\nWell, they aren't all so bad. Some would even call him the crown Jew-el of The Today Show.\n\nWe're sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry!",
