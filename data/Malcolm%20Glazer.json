  "description": "We don't understand the fans of Manchester United.\n\nWe root for a soccer team that is... how do we put it... absolutely terrible. They have never won a championship, and every time they get close... oh, who are we kidding, they never get close. Just an absolute, utter failure. Yet we continue rooting, and hope against hope that a title will come one day. It's not gonna happen.\n\nOver in England, Manchester United has won six championships in eight years, and that's not counting the European Champions League.\n\nYet Man U fans despise the club's owner, Malcolm Glazer.\n\nGlazer took over the club in 1995. On this side of the pond, he helped transform the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers from a laughingstock to a champion (they're back to a laughingstock now, but still). And ever since he took over Man U, they've been winning and winning. Yet the hate grows.\n\nPart of it as Glazer is seen as an American intrusion on England's sacred sport. Part of it is that his financial manipulations are suspect at best, mortgaging the club against itself. Down the line, Man U will be forced to pay millions (if not billions) of interest, leaving the club in financial ruin. At that time, Glazer will presumably pull out, dump Man U and laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nBut still, six championships in eight years!\n\nWe envy the fans of Manchester United.",
