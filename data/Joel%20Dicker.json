  "description": "Let us guess, you probably haven't heard of Joel Dicker. That's because you live in America.\n\nOkay, we realize that a sizable proportion of our audience does not live in America. And those who live in Europe, more specifically in the French-speaking parts of Europe, might have heard of Dicker. Apologies to them.\n\nDicker is a writer, who has broken all kinds of records on the old continent. Not only are his books bestsellers and page-turners, they are also critically acclaimed, a rare combination.\n\nHe has even been compared to Philip Roth, possibly because the Swiss-born Dicker mostly writes about...\n\nAmerican Jews.\n\nProbably a good reason for him to be better known in America?",
