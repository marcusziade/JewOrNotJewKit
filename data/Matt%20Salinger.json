  "description": "With superhero movies dominating the box office, let's talk about one of the worst ever. No, not \"Batman and Robin\" or Shaq's \"Steel\" or \"Batman vs Superman\" (boy, for all the good Batman movies, there sure are a lof of stinkers). Let's talk about \"Captain America\". Bet you didn't expect that!\n\nYet here they are, actual reviews:\n\n\"The movie isn't merely wrong for kids â€” it's just all wrong\"\n\"Real stiff, a corny piece of nostalgic pulp with cheap action [and] cheesy dialogue\"\n\"One of the dumbest movies of all time\"\n\nConfused yet? Well, we're not talking about the recent Captain America movie (\"The First Avenger\") or any of its sequels. We're talking about a mostly forgotten 1990 \"Captain America\". Audiences agreed with reviews: with a budget of 10 million, it made a total of 10... thousand.\n\nThe man who played Cap? In his one and only starring role, someone named Matt Salinger... the son of J.D. Salinger.\n\nYou definitely didn't expect that!",
