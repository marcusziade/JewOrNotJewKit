  "description": "In recent weeks, a new popular profile emerged on JONJ. No, it's not a Hollywood starlet or a sports figure... Well, it actually is a sports figure, but not one you might think.\n\nThat profile? Jerry Krause, the one-time GM of the Chicago Bulls of the NBA.\n\nYou see, this is being written in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic, with athletics extinguished throughout the globe. With nothing to turn to, sports fans tune to whatever is available. They do so in droves, be it the teleconference NFL draft or \"The Last Dance\", the ten-hour documentary dealing with the Bulls final championship season of 1997-98. And prominent in that documentary is Krause, the much-maligned GM despised and ridiculed by Michael Jordan, despite building that basketball dynasty.\n\nKrause cannot really defend himself in the documentary, because he has been dead for three years. Still, his presence in old interviews leads sports fans to flock to our website and his profile (linked below), which we wrote six years ago.\n\nAlso prominent in the documentary? Jerry Reinsdorf, who owns the Bulls (as well as the Chicago White Sox). He is Jewish as well.\n\nWho knows, maybe this profile will become popular too.",
