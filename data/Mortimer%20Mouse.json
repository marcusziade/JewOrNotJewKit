  "description": "We are on record regarding our belief that Walt Disney was not an anti-semite. Yes, there's all kinds of hateful, half-truths about the man behind the mouse. Yes, he was a member in the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a group (to be fair) that has been associated with anti-semitism. Other members of the MPAPAI? Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ayn Rand(!). Not exactly a list of Nazi sympathizers, that.\n\nWe are on record regarding our belief that just because a character displays the characteristics of a negative Jewish stereotype doesn't make it anti-semitic, per se. A greedy, big-nosed character does not an anti-semitic caricature make, unless he expressly self-identifies.  We believe in focusing on the positive aspects of our culture — he's smart, attractive, and moral, he must be Jewish! — rather than the negative.\n\nBut this long schnozzed, buck-toothed, greedy loser we just saw on our daughter's Mickey Mouse DVD last weekend? Yeah, no, we're all kinds of pissed off at this.\n\nHa-cha-cha? Fuck. That.",
