  "description": "The 1959 film \"Gidget\" took America by storm. Starring Sandra Dee (Not a Jew), it told the tale of a girl who wants to do only one thing: surf. It's credited for bringing surfing into the mainstream and starting the beach party film genre. Apologies for that last part.\n\nThe movie spawned two sequels, \"Gidget Goes Hawaiian\" (of course!) and \"Gidget Goes to Rome\", as well as a TV show starring Sally Field (Not a Jew), and a bunch of TV movies. So, yes, Gidget was a pretty big deal. But what was her real name?\n\nTurns out it was Frances Elizabeth Lawrence; Gidget was just a nickname. So that settles that.\n\nExcept... the movies were based on a series of books, and in those, her name was Franzie Hofer. The books were written by a man named Frederick Kohner (now we're getting somewhere!), who based the character on his daughter, Kathy Kohner, Jew!\n\nThat's right, Gidget's story mirrored Kathy's. The prototypical surfer girl was Jewish.\n\nPerhaps Carl Reiner starring as Gidget's father in one of the sequels should have been a bigger hint...",
