He was a teacher and a playwright, a philosopher and a detective. He invented yogurt. He was voted the Greatest Czech of all time.\n\nOnly the last statement is true.

All of Czechia seems to be in on the joke: he is not real, and yet...\n\nWhen the nationwide poll was held in 2005, Cimrman finished first. Alas, the votes for him had to be annulled. Instead, the honors went to King Charles IV, who ruled the Holy Roman Empire in the 14th century and founded Prague's Charles University. A lame cop-out, if you ask us. (For names you might know, Vaclav Havel was #3, Jaromir Jagr #27, Milos Forman #30, Kafka #55, Martina Navratilova #81, and poor Freud relegated all the way to #98.)\n\nHe was Jewish? Yes!
