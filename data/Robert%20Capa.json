  "description": "This is Robert Capa, one of the most famous photojournalists of all time. This is also Robert Capa, one of the most famous photojournalists of all time. They used to be lovers. Confused yet?\n\nThe male Robert Capa was born Endre Friedmann in Budapest in a Jewish family. The female Robert Capa was born Gerta Pohorylle in Germany in a Jewish family. Both immigrated to Paris, met, and fell in love. This is when they invented Robert Capa. Still confused?\n\nFriedmann and Pohorylle decided that a more goyishe name would be more palatable to their audience. For a while, they both worked under the same pseudonym. The duo was most famous for their work during the Spanish Civil War, including the renowned \"The Falling Soldier\".\n\n [X]\n\n\nAt some point, the pseudonym separated. Friedmann stayed Robert Capa, and Pohorylle became Gerda Taro. Clear now?\n\nFriedmann went on to photograph Japan's invasion of China, D-Day, the founding of Israel, and the First Indochina War. Pohorylle's career was aborted in Spain, where she died at the age of 26 during a battle. Friedmann also died on the job, stepping on a land mine in Vietnam.\n\nHope that cleared the confusion...\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\ntaro = false;\nif (x == 1) {\n remember();\n} else {\n memorize();\n if (x == 2) setTitle('Robert Capa');\n if (x == 3) setTitle('Gerda Taro');\n setImage('gerda_taro');\n setSubhead('Gerta Pohorylle', 'August 1, 1910 - July 26, 1937');\n}\n}",
