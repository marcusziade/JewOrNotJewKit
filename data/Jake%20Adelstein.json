  "description": "We have a big problem with \"Tokyo Vice\", and it has to do with the main character, Jake Adelstein.\n\nNo, it's not because he is played by Ansel Elgort, who, let's just say, has been up to questionable behavior lately.\n\nNo, it's not because it's yet another example of the white guy savior complex, although, let's be honest, it kinda is.\n\nNo, it's not because it claims to be based on a true story, while it seems that the real-life Adelstein embellished a lot of it.\n\nNo, it's not because it's incredibly hard to believe that a junior reporter somehow becomes a crime-solving savant.\n\nIt's because Adelstein's real name is Joshua, but he goes by Jake.\n\nWhat the hell is up with that?",
