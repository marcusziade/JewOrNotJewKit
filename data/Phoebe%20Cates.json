  "description": "Whatever happened to Phoebe Cates since \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\"? Sure, there was \"Gremlins\", and then she married Kevin Kline, and...\n\nNope, we got nothing. Even her career on IMDB.com has a glaring hole since the early 90s. Oh well.\n\nSo we're just gonna point out that Cates has more than enough Jewish roots â€” her father was producer Joseph Katz, and she has some Jewish ancestry on her mother's side as well, mixed with some Chinese.\n\nAnd then we're gonna go back to \"Fast Times\" and re-live the iconic scene when Judge Reinhold (whatever happened to him?) watches Phoebe from his window, while she dives into a swimming pool, and...\n\nAnd...\n\nSorry, trailed off for a minute. Who cares what happened with Phoebe Cates when we we'll always have that?",
