Well, the oft-repeated David Hasselhoff suggestion. That's just not happening.\n\nBut here's something weird: in all the years of this website, in all the thousands upon thousands of emails in our suggestion box, among all the important Jews we've yet to profile (and among goyishe non-entities such as Hasselhoff), no one has suggested Neil Simon.\n\nNeil Simon, quite possibly America's greatest (living) playwright. \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\". \"The Odd Couple\". \"Lost in Yonkers\". But no, not a single one of our readers asked us to profile him... as opposed to a certain Mr. Hasselhoff.\n\nSo here we go, despite what our readers may or may not want to see. Neil Simon. Brilliant writer. American icon. Jew.\n\nThat being said, 1100 profiles and we still haven't written about Neil Simon?\n\nPerhaps this one is on us...",
