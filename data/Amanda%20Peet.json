  "description": "Now, granted, we haven't seen everything Amanda Peet has been in. That being said...\n\nWhy does she always play the bitch?\n\nPeet's most prominent role was in \"The Whole Nine Yards\": bitch. The abhorrent \"Saving Silverman\": bitch. Woody Allen's \"Melinda and Melinda\": bitch. Even her early turn as one of Seinfeld's girlfriends (she is the one who lives with \"a dude\"): bitch.\n\nIs it something about her personality? Is it her deep-set eyes? Is it just typecasting? Or...\n\nOr let's just say that even though Peet is half Quaker, she considers herself Jewish, and stop worrying about her career choices.",
