  "description": "What the Boop?!\n\nThe list of \"Famous Female Cartoon Characters\" makes a magillah like \"Jewish Sports Heroes\" look as long as the Torah. And the majority of its members can be dismissed as merely the wives/girlfriends of even more famous male characters. Minnie and Mickey. Wilma and Fred. Marge and Homer. Hillary and Bill (whaddaya mean they're not fictional?), etc.\n\nThe search for an independent, hard-working, animated (in both senses of the word) female role model basically leads to two places â€” the goyishe Wonder Woman and the (you guessed it!) Jewish Betty Boop.\n\nFor those of you too young to remember (i.e., anyone with the skill-set to actually visit this website), Betty Boop was the can-do heroine of a series of Depression-era cartoon shorts a la Mickey and Bugs, though currently less well known (but certainly not obscure). And don't let the looks fool you, Betty Boop is no black-and-white bimbo, but a modern, independent woman worthy of anyone's admiration. \n\nAs for her Kosher certification, the films themselves provide an ark's-worth of evidence. From her yiddish-peppered patois to her yarmulke-wearing abba, this hip cat's a no-doubter.\n\nIn other words, she's not just the most famous, respectable female Jewish cartoon out there. She might be the best one, period.\n\nBoop-oop-a-doop, indeed.",
