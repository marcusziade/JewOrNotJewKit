Whoever it was, we're pretty sure he wasn't Jewish.\n\nBefore we start rattling off every sport that wasn't invented by Jews, let's get to the one that definitely was: ultimate. (Don't call it ultimate frisbee.)\n\nFor those who haven't frequented college campuses in the last few decades, ultimate is a crossbreed of frisbee and football. Alright, calling it a real sport is somewhat of a stretch, but it does have a world governing body and everything.\n\nSo who is the Jew behind ultimate? Joel Silver, who co-created it during his time at Lafayette College. If that name sounds familiar, it's because Silver grew up to be one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood... and a man so large that is seems improbable he ever played a sport in the first place.\n\nAnother sport invented by Jews?\n\nCompetitive arguing. But that goes without saying...",
