  "description": "What if... the communists won?\n\nPipe down, Ronald Reagan fans. We know what you're thinking. Communism is evil, yadda yadda yadda. And who are we to argue. The Soviet machine is dead, North Korea is a glorified labor camp, and China... well, yes. But we're not talking about China.\n\nAnd we're not talking about communists winning the eternal struggle against capitalists. We're talking about the specific case of the German Revolution of 1918, when the German communists were oh so close of taking control of the country... That is, until their leaders, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, the latter a Jew, were murdered by opposite forces.\n\nSo what would have happen if Karl and Rosa weren't killed and turned Germany into their version of communist haven, with a Jewish woman in charge? Would Hitler still find a way to come to power? Would the Holocaust be avoided? Would Europe today be ruled by an Orwellian Soviet Union of Russia and Germany?\n\nWe better stop. We think we just heard Ronald Reagan turn over in his grave.",
