  "description": "It's funny, this country of ours. Depending on whom you listen to, either Barack Obama is surrounding himself with too many Jews... Or not enough.\n\nOn one hand, the first person Obama hired, his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, is Jewish. So is Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod. And there are various other Jews of lesser interest in various positions around the President and the VP.\n\nOn the other hand, there are no Jews in Obama's Cabinet. Not one.\n\nEven George W. Bush (\"none of my friends are Jewish\") had a token Jew, Michael Chertoff, as the Secretary of National Security.\n\nWhat about Timothy Geithner, you might ask? Obama's Secretary of the Treasury? He is Jewish, right?\n\nNope. Geithner's ancestry is half German half WASP, with no evidence of Jewish roots. He was raised Episcopalian is now a member of the United Church of Christ.\n\nSo yeah, not so much. \n\nHis middle name is Franz, for crying out loud. Makes you wonder how this Jewish rumor even got started.",
