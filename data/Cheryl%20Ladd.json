  "description": "Years ago, in the Jaclyn Smith profile, we wrote a rather comprehensive history of \"Charlie's Angels\", its reboots or remakes. Or so we thought.\n\nAs it turns out, we did not pay enough attention to that original iteration, specifically to Cheryl Ladd. And, on the surface, why should we pay attention to Cheryl Ladd? A blond shiksa from South Dakota...\n\nA blond shiksa from South Dakota whose maternal grandfather was named Ira Katz!\n\nWe'll need to curb that enthusiasm. Somehow, Ira Katz, the man with perhaps the Jewiest name in history, was as Jewish as a ham and cheese sandwich. (His original name was Catt... so he changed it to Katz to sound MORE Jewish? What kind of the world did he live in?)\n\nHopefully, this is the last time we need to write about \"Charlie's Angels\"...\n\nWait, there's been another remake!?",
