  "description": "Early Hollywood loved its Latin lovers. Rudolph Valentino is the obvious example, but there were many others: Ramon Novarro, Antonio Moreno, Ricardo Cortez...\n\nWell, Cortez wasn't exactly Latin. When rumors started circling that he wasn't, the studios had an explanation: he was French!\n\nEarly Hollywood loved its French lovers. Unfortunately, Cortez wasn't French either, so the truth came out: he was Austrian!\n\nEarly Hollywood loved its Austrian lovers? Doubtful, and Cortez wasn't Austrian anyway: he was Jacob Krantz, a New York Jew.\n\nWho knows, maybe Rudolph Valentino was really Rueben Volowitz... We wouldn't put that past early Hollywood.",
