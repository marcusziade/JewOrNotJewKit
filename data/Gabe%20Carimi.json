  "description": "Who is the biggest Jew we've ever profiled? And by \"biggest\", we don't mean one who observes Judaism the most (whatever that means), or even who has the biggest... you know (Milton Berle?).\n\nBy \"biggest\", we mean just that. Biggest. Physically. Tallest and heaviest.\n\nOf course, with over 1000 profiles, finding the biggest is not that simple. Even if we discount all the women (sorry, Roseanne), and skip over the Scientists and Writers categories, that still leaves us hundreds of potential candidates. And height and weight numbers are not always readily available.\n\nBut for one category they are: Athletes, and we're willing to bet that the biggest Jew will come from there. More specifically, from (American) football. And even more specifically, a football lineman.\n\nAnd what do you know, we have two that break 300 pounds: current Dallas Cowboys Kyle Kosier and Igor Olshansky. Kosier is 6'5\", 305 lbs, but Olshansky has him beat: his height is the same, but he weighs ten pounds heaver, so this makes him our website's biggest Jew...\n\nUntil now. For recent Chicago Bears first-round draft pick Gabe Carimi (and yes, he is Jewish, the Italian last name coming from his father's step-father) matches Olshansky at 315 lbs (143 kg), but his height is 6'7\" (2.01 m), making him our biggest Jew.\n\nYes, it's important discussions like this one that made us such a popular website. What can we do.",
