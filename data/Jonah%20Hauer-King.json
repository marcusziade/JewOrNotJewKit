  "description": "Our search for a Jewish Disney princess is long documented, with somewhat uninspiring results, despite our claims of success. Well, we've discovered our problem: we should have been looking for a Jewish Disney PRINCE.\n\nNo, no, no! There is absolutely no way Prince Charming or Prince Eric or Prince(?) Aladdin is Jewish. But Disney's new wave of turning animation into live action has actually given us an actual, Jewish prince. Well, a Jewish actor who portrays a prince. No, it's not Aladdin!\n\nIt's Eric, Ariel's object of desire in \"The Little Mermaid\". In the new adaption, he is played by British Jewish actor Jonah Hauer-King. No, we're not exactly kvelling. It's freaking Eric, the blandest of the bland! His only known positive quality is \"he likes dogs\". And let's not forget that he ditches Ariel for the hot version of Ursula the minute she opens her mouth. Seriously, Eric sucks, Jewish actor or not.\n\nCan't we have Ariel instead? Heck, we'd even take Ursula!",
