  "description": "If only Robert Adler knew when he was spending all those late nights perfecting his invention...\n\nHow it would grow from something incredibly simple to a grotesque monstrosity...\n\nHow many battles would be fought to control it...\n\nHow many families it would tear apart...\n\nHow it would pit brother against sister, husband against wife...\n\nHow it would make humankind lazier and more obese...\n\nHow people would become so dependent on it...\n\nHow people wouldn't be able to imagine their life without it...\n\nIf only Robert Adler knew all those things, maybe he would have kept the remote control on the drawing board.",
