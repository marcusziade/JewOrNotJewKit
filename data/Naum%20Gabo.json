  "description": "Naum Gabo invented a whole art movement. Can you figure out what it is?\n\nKinetic art is \"a form of art that depends on movement for its effect\". Gabo is credited with giving it a name (often co-credited with his brother, Antoine (Natan) Pevsner; Naum changed his last name so the pair could be distinguished easier).\n\nIn 1919, Gabo created the first ever piece of such art, \"Standing Waves\" (also known as \"Kinetic Construction\" or \"Kinetic Structure\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust in case you want to question his credentials!\n\n\nd = document.getElementById(\"d1\");\ne = document.getElementById(\"d2\");\ninterval = 200;\nmx = 5;\nhh = 0; vv = 0;\nr = 0;\nv = 1;\nend = false;\nfunction start() {\nsetTimeout('move()', interval);\n}\nfunction finish() {\nend = true;\n}\nfunction move() {\nd.style.transform = 'rotate('+r+'deg)';\nr += v;\nif (r == mx) v = -1;\nif (r == -mx) v = 1; \nif (!end) start();\nend = false;\n}\nmove();",
