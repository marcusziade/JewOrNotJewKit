  "description": "Anna Smashnova is known for two things... Being the SUCCESSFUL Russian tennis Anna (take that, Kournikova!) and having a name that is perfect for her sport.\n\n\"Russian\" might be a misnomer here; even though Anna was born in the Soviet Union, her family emigrated to Israel when she was a teen, and she competed under that country's flag for the duration of her career. As for that name, there is no word \"smash\" in Russian, so this is just a pure coincidence. Or is it...?\n\nOne of the theories for the origin of \"Smashnov(a)\" is from an old Russian word \"smashno\": one who constantly waves their arms.\n\nSo, yes, perfect for the sport!",
