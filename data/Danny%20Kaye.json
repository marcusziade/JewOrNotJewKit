  "description": "In 1944, producer Samuel Goldwyn wanted to cast comedian Danny Kaye in his wartime movie, \"Up in Arms\". One problem: Kaye just looked too Jewish.\n\nGoldwyn, of course, had no qualms about goyifying: this is the man who was born Schmuel Gelbfisz, became Samuel Goldfish, and then changed his name again, this time to match his movie studio. Kaye didn't need a name change â€” it was already shortened from Kaminsky, but it was his Jewish nose that was giving Goldwyn the shpilkes.\n\nSo Goldwyn ordered Kaye to get a nose job. Kaye refused, and somehow got away with it. Instead, Goldwyn made him dye his hair red, which worked out for Kaye in the long run. His ginger locks became a trademark as he rose to fame as a multifaceted star of comedy, stage, and screen, with a special spot as the star of numerous children's films and television programs.\n\nAnd that gigantic schnoz? Somehow, the children didn't care. Go figure.",
