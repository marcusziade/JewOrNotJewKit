A child of Russian Jewish immigrants, his music had a profound impact on his countrymen.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nIn 1967, Gainsbourg and his girlfriend, Brigitte Bardot (you read that right, that Brigitte Bardot), recorded a song titled \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\". The piece was an intertwining duet between two lovers in the middle of coitus, ending with an orgasm.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBardot's husband found out about the recording and thwarted its release (apparently, it was fine for Bardot to shtup Gainsbourg, just not to sing about it). So Gainsbourg waited a couple of years, moved off from Bardot to English singer Jane Birkin, and re-recorded the duet with her. It immediately topped numerous European charts... and was banned in several countries.\n\nSo far... still good.\n\nIn 1982, Gainsbourg recorded another duet. This song was titled \"Lemon Incest\" (you read that right). The album and the music video featured Gainsbourg and his partner together in bed. She was clothed; he wasn't. Oh, and she was his 12-year-old daughter, Charlotte. (Yes, you read that right!)\n\nSo far, so...",
