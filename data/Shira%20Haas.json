One group that didn't like the show? The Hasids. They didn't exactly like their portrayal, despite the fact that it was based on real-life memoirs of a woman who did in the real life what Haas did on the TV screen (or perhaps because of that...).\n\nIncredibly, \"Unorthodox\" is not the only Hasid-centric show on Netflix. There is also \"Shtisel\", about an Israeli ulta-Orthodox family. One of the characters is a young woman about to get married... also played by Shira Haas!\n\nHere's hoping that Haas' recent recognition will allow her to broaden her wings.
