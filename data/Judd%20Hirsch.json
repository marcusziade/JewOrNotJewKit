And we're rather ashamed of our younger selves for liking it in the first place.\n\nOne saving grace: when everyone starts praying and the Secretary of Defense tells Judd Hirsch's character \"I'm not Jewish\", the response is \"Well, nobody's perfect\". That line is still pure gold. The rest? Spare us.\n\nMaybe we should take up home decorating...",
