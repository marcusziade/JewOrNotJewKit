  "description": "As you probably know by now, if there is a beautiful Jewish woman out there, then at some point she's gonna be profiled on this website.\n\nBut who is to judge who is beautiful and who is not? Sure, we can leave it to Hollywood, but then for every Natalie Portman you get a Sarah Jessica Parker. Sheesh.\n\nSo we turn to a fairer panel, the Miss Universe pageant. For if you can't trust the opinion of a judge's panel consisting of cosmetic executives, magazine publishers, and ex-jocks, who can you trust?\n\nAfter that exhaustive lead-in, we're finally at our point. There has been at least one Jewish Miss Universe, Rina Messinger. And not only was she a beauty; at the time of her victory, she was a pilot in the Israeli army.\n\nA bomb-dropping Jewish bombshell? Now that's something you don't need a panel to approve.",
