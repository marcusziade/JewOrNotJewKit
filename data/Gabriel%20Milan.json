  "description": "Say you want to go to Denmark. Why wouldn't you, it's pretty lovely! It's kinda far though...\n\nWell, did you know that as recently as 106 years ago, there was Danish land, right here in America! The US Virgin Islands belonged to Denmark for two and a half centuries. First, the Danish West India company took over Saint Thomas, then they colonized Saint John and bought Saint Croix from the French — voila! — the Danish West Indies!\n\nThe islands were ran by a governor-general, appointed by the Danish crown. Somehow, for a brief period in the 1680s, it was a Jew, Gabriel Milan. He was sent to give Denmark better control of the islands, but failed to do so. Two years later, he went back to the mother country, put on trial and beheaded. Must have been pretty tough to please that king...\n\nIn any case, in 1867, the US tried to buy the islands from Denmark for $7.5 million (you will note that the same year they bought the much, much larger Alaska for $7.2 — stupid, stupid Russians!), but the sale fell through. It wasn't until 1917 when the islands were transferred, for $25 million — about $600 million today. (So, 1/10th of the price of the Washington Commanders...)\n\nStill, today, you don't need to go that far to get to Danish land...\n\nGreenland. You can go to Greenland.",
