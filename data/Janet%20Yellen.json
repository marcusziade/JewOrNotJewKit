  "description": "Janet Yellen is going to be the first ever female Secretary of the Treasury (about time!). She previously was the first ever female Chair of the Federal Reserve, serving under both Obama and Trump.\n\nIf you are surprised why Trump didn't fire the super-competent Yellen, don't be: the President has no right to dismiss the Fed Chairperson. He is in charge, however, in nominating one, so Trump bypassed Yellen when her term was up in 2018. His reason?\n\nWe pause here. Why do you think Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States of America, chose not to ask Janet Yellen, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, to come back for a second term? Give it a minute. Think of all the reasons, on various scale of ridiculousness. Got one? Well...\n\nTrump didn't renominate Yellen because she was... too short. You can't make shit like this up! You really can't!\n\nAnywho, Yellen, all 5'3\" of her, is now up for a rather large promotion.\n\nBoy, will we be glad when sanity gets restored in this country! (ABOUT TIME...)",
