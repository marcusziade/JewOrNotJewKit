  "description": "\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" sure was trendsetting and popular... We wonder, what has happened to the actors since then?\n\nJason Priestly tried to be a race car driver, crashed into a wall, and almost killed himself.\n\nShannen Doherty appeared in terrible TV ads for shady online colleges.\n\nJennie Garth headlined a reality show about getting back to her \"country roots\".\n\nBrian Austin Green married Megan Fox.\n\nGabrielle Carteris fell into a wormhole and was swept into a different dimension.\n\nLuke Perry starred in a movie... on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nTori Spelling is still Tori Spelling.\n\nCome to think of it, Ian Ziering's turn in \"Sharknado\" might just push him to the top of the list?",
