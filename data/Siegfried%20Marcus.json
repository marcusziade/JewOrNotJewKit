  "description": "If you're a faithful reader of our website, you can probably list the many useful inventions Jews are responsible for: Aspirin. Blue jeans. Birth control pill. Ballpoint pen. Rhinoplasty. And many others.\n\nBut there is one Jewish invention that you might not be aware of, and it just might be the most useful of all (yes, even more so than rhinoplasty): the automobile.\n\nWhat's that, you say? The automobile was not invented by Jews, but rather by Germans? Karl Benz, Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach?\n\nWell... yes and no. Even though Benz is usually cited as the inventor of the modern automobile, and Daimler and Maybach are often thrown into the mix, there is one man who history forgot. Siegfried Marcus, an Austrian Jew, came up with the automobile at about the same time Benz did. So who had it first? And why is Marcus never mentioned?\n\nThe Nazis, hateful of his roots, attempted to erase Marcus from history, destroying all his patents. Other than in Vienna, where's Marcus' then-famous \"Second Car\" is proudly displayed in the Technical Museum, he is mostly an afterthought.\n\nExcept on our website, that is. Aren't you glad, faithful reader?",
