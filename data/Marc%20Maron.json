  "description": "We use a lot of Yiddish words on this site. However, we realize there are many of you that do not know what those words mean. So here's a helpful guide to some of the terms we use on a regular(ish) basis:\n\nMeshuggenah: One who is crazy\n\nSchlimiel: A person who can't do anything right\n\nKvetch: To complain \n\nKibitz: To chat, converse. To give unwanted or unwarranted advice\n\nNow let's use it all in a sentence:\n\nWhy, in Hashem's name, do we listen twice a week to this meshuggenah schlimiel kvetch about his feral cats and kibitz with B-list comedy/music celebrities?\n\nSee how easy it is to pepper your patois with a bisel of the mother tongue?",
