Belch. No, that's not a real one, but the fact that it fits right in should tell you something.\n\nThere are so many nice goyishe names out there. Thomas. Peter. Stewart. Peyton. Sven. Why even encroach on Jewish ones?\n\nSigh. What can we do? It looks like we've lost Eli. Oh well. At least we still got Isaac and Herschel.\n\nWhat's that? Isaac Bruce and Herschel Walker? Damnation.\n\nBarak, anyone?",
