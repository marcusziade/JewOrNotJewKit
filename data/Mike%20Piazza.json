  "description": "Throughout his illustrious playing career, Hall of Fame catcher Mike Piazza was plagued by a persistent, pesky rumor.\n\nNo, not that one. THAT one.\n\nOh, it bothered Piazza so much, one could tell! Even after he addressed it numerous times, it just didn't go away. People continued to ask. People didn't believe him. Is he? Is he?\n\nWhy? Why do people care so much if Piazza is THAT? Why does he have to go on the defensive and explain that he is not THAT? Would it really be so horrible if he was THAT? Absolutely not!\n\nNo, the rumor wasn't that he is Jewish.\n\nThat one started after he retired.",
