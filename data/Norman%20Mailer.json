Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, all I can think about is sex sex sex sex SEX! SEX!!!! But I'm not getting any. SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! â€” Jason Abramsky, 17, Phoenix, Arizona\n\nDear Jason,\n\nWe're not sure what you want us to do here. Short of hiring a prostitute... but that's illegal in Arizona, right? Nevada is only a short drive away...\n\nOr maybe you can become a famous writer? Look how it worked out for Norman Mailer! You'd be hard-pressed to find someone more obsessed with sex than he was. Yet he turned that fixation into words and... voila! Six wives, various sexcapades, etc, etc... (Including one where he punched his pregnant wife in the stomach to entice her to have group sex... Or the one when he stabbed her... Ummmm... Never mind.)\n\nOr, you know, you can try talking to girls. That just might work out.\n\nSEX!\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
