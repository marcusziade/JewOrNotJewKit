  "description": "So which one is right, Burma or Myanmar...\n\n... is not a question we'd ever thought we'd ask at Jew or Not Jew. After all, the odds of us venturing into the jungles of Myanmar (Burma?) are pretty low. We wouldn't want to run into Burmese (Myanmarian?) warlords...\n\nThat's the one thing we know about Myanmar (Burma?): it has it share of warlords. The country hasn't exactly been stable for a long time. A half  century of military rule, continuous civil war... warlords.\n\nEven beauty queen warlords! (Would that make them warladies?) In 1965, Louisa Benson, previously Miss Burma (Miss Myanmar?), took over the command of Karen National Liberation Army from her dead husband. And what do you know... Louisa's father was Jewish, real name Moses Ben-Zion Koder.\n \nA Jewish Myanmarian (Burmese?) beauty queen warlord?\n\nSo, which one is right, Burma or Myanmar?",
