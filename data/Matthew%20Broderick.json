  "description": "We've talked at length of shiksappeal, the desire of Jewish men for beautiful goyishe women. We've gotten us a few good ones, from Marilyn Monroe to Elizabeth Banks. The list is long.\n\nBut does it work in reverse? We can call it yentappeal: the desire of goyishe men for Jewish women. Surely, there are some examples.\n\nHmmmm.\n\nWell, let's take Sarah Jessica Parker. As Jews, we can't find her beautiful (see her profile for the explanation). But the goyim seem to disagree; she is definitely a sex symbol, to say the least. Yeah, it baffles the mind.\n\nAnd she is married to Matthew Broderick! Talk about Goy City! And they have been together for over a decade, such a rarity for Hollywood! So here it is, yentappeal!\n\nNot so fast.\n\nFor Matthew himself is half-Jewish, on his mother's side.\n\nSo much for that theory. Hmmmm.\n\nAHA! Parker might look 100% Jewish, but she is not; she is only half. So, perhaps Broderick's goy half lusts for her Jewish side (shiksappeal), and his Jewish half is enamored with her goyish one (yentappeal)?\n\nSee, it all adds up!",
