  "description": "\"What's the point of horror?\", the eleven-year-old recently asked. It was really hard to come up with an answer. \"Some people like to be scared,\" we said. \"This makes no sense!\", he replied. \"Why would anyone ever want to be scared on purpose?\"\n\nPerhaps we should have introduced him to the Goosebumps books? After all, R. L. Stine's work is the second best-selling children's series of all time (behind some woman named J. K.). Children of all ages learn to love to be scared... which serves as a gateway to enjoying horror, we guess?\n\nStine, who is Jewish, has been quite prolific. There are 62 books in the original series, and various spin-offs and extensions bring the total to 235. The \"Stephen King of children's literature\" has sold more than 400 million copies worldwide. So, perhaps...\n\nNope! No Goosebumps for the eleven-year-old! He prefers dystopian YA novels. No Goosebumps for us either... What's the point of horror, anyway?",
