  "description": "Dave Kleiman was not discovered until days after his death. He was lying in feces, with empty alcohol bottles and a loaded gun next to him.\n\nAt the time of his death, Dave Kleiman might have been worth hundreds of millions. \"Might\" is the key word here.\n\nThe details are just emerging, but Kleiman is being revealed as the co-creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious man behind the online currency, did not exist. The multi-year hunt for the ghost has now delivered two names. One is Australian businessman Craig Steven Wright. The other is Kleiman: army veteran, computer security expert, confined to a wheelchair, author, Jew.\n\nAs Bitcoin shot up in value, Kleiman's holdings did as well. So why did we say \"might\"? Well, intrinsically, there is no value in Bitcoin. It only has value if one believes that is does. As of now, many people do... but that might change, and the world's supply of Bitcoin could be turned back into the worthless bits that bore it.\n\nStill, you have to hand it to the man, who minted a fortune literally out of nothing...\n\nMuch good that fortune did him.",
