  "description": "Here we thought we were done with our Olympic coverage. Two straight weeks of back-to-back-to-back profiles. We were exhausted!\n\nAnd then Linoy Ashram had to win the gold. In rhythmic gymnastics. Rhythmic gymnastics!\n\nStop it, Jew or Not Jew, you might say. What exactly is your problem with rhythmic gymnastics? The pageantry, the dancing, the grace, the ribbons, the rhythm! It's a perfectly pleasant sport!\n\nThe makeup? Take a look at Linoy, the picture from the medal stand. You see that makeup? It's hard to miss! How is anything where makeup is required be considered a sport?\n\nYou know what, let's thaw our cold, hardened hearts. Let's celebrate Linoy's achievement. Let's celebrate Jewish prowess in rhythmic gymnastics: it's perfectly pleasant!\n\nIt's just not a sport.",
