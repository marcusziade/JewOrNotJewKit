But which one?\n\nDynasty founder Mayer Amschel Rothschild?\n\nOne of his sons, Salomon, Nathan, Carl, or James (the founders of banking families in Austria, England, Naples, and France, respectively)?\n\nHow about Baron Nathaniel Mayer Rothschild, the first Jewish member of the British House of Lords?\n\nOr Edmond James de Rothschild, one of the early proponents of Zionism?\n\nDoes it really matter? Can we even tell them apart? All dead. All rich. All Jewish. That works for us.",
