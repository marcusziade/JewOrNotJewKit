  "description": "Not many details are known about Arnold Deutsch's life. Even his birth year is unclear; it might have been 1903 or 1904. His death is a mystery as well. He might have been captured by the Nazis when parachuting behind enemy lines... or his ship might have been sunk on its way to America. Nobody knows for sure.\n\nHere's something we do know: Deutsch was a Soviet spy, who recruited the notorious Cambridge Five, including probably the most famous spy of them all, Kim Philby.\n\nWhile in London, to pull wool over British eyes, Deutsch pretended to be someone who would never support communism: a pious Jew. In real life, he clearly wasn't pious, but was definitely Jewish.\n\nThat we know?",
