  "description": "Earlier this year, Trevor Rosenthal decided to take three days off from his job. He wanted to be present for the birth of his daughter.\n\nNothing abnormal, right? Heck, we hope that everyone who fathers a child decides to take time off for the special occasion.\n\nWell, it seemed abnormal to some, who called Rosenthal out. You see, Rosenthal is the closer for the St. Louis Cardinals, a team in the middle of a pennant race. How dare he take three games off!\n\nUnfortuantely, in this day and age, everyone with an Internet connection thinks they have a voice. And irrelevant and idiotic as those voices are, sometimes they're heard.\n\nSo let's ignore the irrelevant idiots and leave the Internet for the important things: figuring out if people are Jewish.\n\nRosenthal is not.",
