  "description": "What is Eurotrash? It's pretty hard to define it, but when you see it, you know it, right?\n\nLeather pants: Eurotrash.\n\nExposed chests: Eurotrash.\n\nGiant sunglasses: Eurotrash.\n\nElectronic rock: Eurotrash.\n\nFull-body tan: Definitely Eurotrash.\n\nDepeche Mode? Oh, Depeche Mode is the Eurotrashiest of all Eurotrash! (Eurotrashy guitarist Martin Gore, 1/16 Jewish, pictured here.)\n\nAnd you know what? Eurotrash doesn't have to be a bad thing. You can embrace all the Euro... and the trashiness.\n\nNot admitting that we do!",
