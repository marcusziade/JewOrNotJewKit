  "description": "If you ever watch Bravo, and we're not admitting we watch Bravo, you can't help but run into Bethenny Frankel. Bethenny is one of those reality celebrities, meaning that the only reason for her existence is to be filmed around the clock for shows like \"Bethenny Getting Married\", \"Bethenny Having a Baby\", and \"Bethenny Buying a Rhinoceros\".\n\nIf we're gonna watch a reality show, we'd rather watch one about Bethenny's namesake, simply known as Frankel. He is one of the best athletes in the history of his sport, recently retiring with an undefeated record. He is now moving into a luxurious life filled with fornication. He is a horse, of course.\n\nA horse that is named after Bethenny's father, famed horse trainer Robert Frankel. So, even though he (the horse, not the trainer) is owned by a Saudi prince, that makes him just a little bit Jewish, since Frankel (the trainer, not the horse) was.\n\nSo, how would the reality show go? Well, Frankel would move into a harem, where he will be surrounded by various vivacious females...\n\nSounds like Bravo, right?",
