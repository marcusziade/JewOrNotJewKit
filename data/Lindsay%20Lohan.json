Apparently, she now wants to become a Jew.\n\nOy vey.\n\nNo, that's not us talking, that's Lindsay herself, responding to the\nrumors of her break-up(?) from her Jewish girlfriend(?) Samantha\nRonson.\n\nOy vey.\n\nThis time it was us.\n\nSeriously, Lindsay. You tried Kabbalah. You tried Scientology. You\ntried Alcoholics Anonymous. Do you really have to try Judaism?\n\nOy, those meshuggenah shiksas!",
