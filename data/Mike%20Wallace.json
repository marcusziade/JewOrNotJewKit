  "description": "Everyone knows where the conservatives in this country go for biased, hack-job, yellow journalism: Fox News. But where does the American liberal head to for their marching orders?\n\nWell, ironically enough it's on Sundays with the crusading, geriatric journalists of 60 Minutes. There, the tie-dyed-in-the-wool liberal learns which corporations are evil (spoiler: all of them), which non-American countries are doing a good job of taking care of their people (spoiler: none of them)  and which baby boomer celebs come off as really cool folks when you softball them (spoiler: all of them).\n\n Is it surprising to learn there are Jews on this program? Yeah, we didn't think so. Notably, there's today's profilee Mike Wallace who led the NFL in yards per catch last year... whoops, wrong Wallace... who was one of the founding members of the program.\n\nSadly, though, the tradition of angry, wrinkled Israelites wandering the desert for 40 years to discover the truth about who is poisoning our air/government/minds is coming to an end. Wallace is well and retired, leaving us with only the 70-year-old Lesley Stahl (feh) who looks positively spritely next to the older-than-most-planets Morley Safer.\n\nAnd while 60 Minutes continues, it does so with younger (ok, mid-50s, but that's practically a toddler to a 60 Minutes vet), goyisher reporters such as Scott Pelley, Steve Kroft, and the Queen of all Goyim, Katie Couric. It's just not the same.\n\nOh, where is the welfare-state-loving, spineless, close-minded Jewish liberal to go? Well, there's always PBS, we suppose.",
