  "description": "When it comes to attention starved, inappropriate, crybaby owners in sports, there may be none worse than Mark Cuban.\n\nTime and again his face (and his mouth) pops up on every sports news program in the country for his childish behavior. Running onto the court. Throwing tantrums. Making inflammatory comments about the players, the refs, the league, even Commissioner (and fellow Jew!) David Stern. Then come the accusations of insider trading. It just gets worse and worse as Cuban does anything and everything to feed his massive ego as part of what is clearly a cry for help from a deeply disturbed human being.\n\nWhat a jerk. What a loser. What an awesome, awesome Jew.\n\nSure he's an idiot. But he's a passionate, well-meaning idiot that loves sports, loves fans, and will do anything to win a championship. With all the penny-pinching, fan-cheating owners out there, willing to do anything to make a buck except improve their team, we'll take an overgrown baby in a turtleneck running onto the court every once in a while.  \n\nHe can run our Dairy Queen any day.",
