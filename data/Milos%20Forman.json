  "description": "What's the deal with the \"Borderline Jew\" verdict, we're often asked? Can't you just say \"Jew\" or \"Not a Jew\"? Why overcomplicate it?\n\nWell, here's the simple answer: sometimes, it's just not clear. \"Borderline Jew\" is most often used for people with one Jewish, one goyishe parent. So we try to gauge how the profilees themselves feel about their Jewishness. Do they consider themselves Jewish? Great, Jew. Do they openly practice another religion? No Jew for you! But what about all those... BORDERLINE cases?\n\nTake two-time Oscar winner Milos Forman. The Czech director has one Jewish, one goyishe parent. However, he only found out about his real, Jewish father later in his life. So he definitely wasn't raised Jewish. At this point, we can't find a quote whether he considers himself Jewish. But there is also nothing that says he DOESN'T consider himself Jewish. So what are we to do? Borderline Jew!\n\nThere are exceptions to that, and exceptions to the exceptions, and really, after 1400 profiles, every permutation we thought imaginable, and then some. And quite often we render the verdict, only to find better information and having to go back to reverse the claim...\n\nSo, what's the deal with the \"Barely a Jew\" verdict? Don't get us started.",
