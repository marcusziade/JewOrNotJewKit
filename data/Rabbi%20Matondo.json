  "description": "We were waiting until June to profile a soccer Rabbi.\n\nYou see, every four years Europe holds its continental soccer tournament. This time around, Wales qualified (yes, Wales, despite not being an independent country, has an international soccer team) for Euro 2020. One of Wales' rising young stars is a winger named Rabbi Matondo. It was going to be an easy profile to write, with a rather obvious punchline.\n\nWell, there is not going to be a Euro 2020. Much like the rest of the sports world, it has been shut down due to coronavirus.\n\nPerhaps we should have left out \"sports\" from that previous sentence. No qualifier is needed. Much like the rest of the world, Euro 2020 has been shut down. And what a strange world is has become, with emptiness on streets and supermarket shelves... as well as on soccer fields.\n\nSo we are not going to wait until the Euro's potential return in 2021, and just profile the soccer Rabbi now. No, he is not Jewish; he is of Congolese descent. That's just his first name... and it's pronounced \"Rab-ee\".\n\nTold you it was an obvious punchline.",
