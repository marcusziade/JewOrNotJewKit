All that to an applause of a delighted audience. Is this your card?\n\nBut what happens when good stage magicians...

He started as a stage magician in Germany in the 1920s, but went farther than that. Hanussen dabbled in clairvoyance, astrology, and the paranormal, converting a Berlin mansion into \"The Palace of the Occult\". Sadly, he didn't stop there.\n\nFor all the bored housewives and swanky aristocrats that sought Hanussen's services, there was one client who wanted to know more. A client who Hanussen taught the value of stage presence, dramatic gesturing, and crowd control. A client who used what he learned to win over Germany... and the rest was history.\n\nSadly for Hanussen, it did not end well.
