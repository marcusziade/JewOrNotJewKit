  "description": "Previously we profiled Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock on TV's (and movies', and books', and ill conceived musical albums') Star Trek. \n\nHowever, this is not a profile of our pointy eared pal Mr. Spock. This is a profile of the man he is often confused for, Dr. Spock. And the two could not be more different.\n\nMr. Spock — from the planet Vulcan.\n\nDr. Spock — born in Connecticut.\n\nMr. Spock — an adventurer and scientist who always advised his Captain to hold logic above emotional concerns.\n\nDr. Spock — a writer and pediatrician who advised parents to show their babies affection.\n\nMr. Spock — symbol of overweight, unathletic dorks everywhere.\n\nDr. Spock — won a gold medal rowing in the 1924 Olympics.\n\nMr. Spock — played by a Jew, therefore at least possibly Jewish according to the Jewish actor = Jewish fictional character (but only if we like them) corollary postulated by this website.\n\nDr. Spock — not a Jew. Darn. \n\nSeriously, how does anyone get these two confused?",
