  "description": "College graduates!\n\nHaving trouble finding a job? Of course, you are! Perhaps you should consider the field of mad scientist assistance?\n\nWhat a great way to put those chemistry degrees to use! You get to live in exotic locales, participate is exciting experiments, work with interesting people... And did we mention that room and board is included?\n\nNow, to be fair, there are some downsides. The pay is rather negligible. You will need to bring a sweater, because the castles tend to be a tad drafty. The monsters sometimes go berserk. You might have to change your name to Igor. And yes, the villagers tend to grow restless. But don't you worry, their first targets would be the monster and then the mad scientist. You'd be a distant third, if that.\n\nSounds good? Then pack your bags and embark on a great new career as a mad scientist assistant! You won't be sorry!\n\nAnd, yes, Jews are welcome. Why do you ask?",
