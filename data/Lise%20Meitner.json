  "description": "The Nobel Committee is notoriously fickle with their awards. It's often not who wins, it's who DOESN'T win. Many of the world's great minds have been denied the honor based on politics, or geography, or (dare we say ANTISEMITISM? No, let's not.) various other absurd reasons.\n\nSo you gotta feel for Jewish, Austrian-born, scientist Lise Meitner. Together with Otto Hahn, she discovered nuclear fission. Hahn, famous for cooperating with Nazis, got the Nobel; Meitner, who fled Germany in the late 30s, didn't.\n\nPerplexing, to say the least. Especially considering that the Nobel came in 1944, in the midst of the war. To give it to a Nazi collaborator and to deny his Jewish partner? That wreaks of ANTISEMITISM just seems wrong, doesn't it?\n\nNow look at us, getting all riled-up here. 65-year-old injustices sure get the blood boiling, don't they?\n\nBut we're gonna calm down, just a bit. You see, Meitner, who was born Jewish, converted to Christianity at the age of 30.\n\nTalk about ANTISEMITISM? Self-loathing? absurd decisions.",
