  "description": "Did you know that Jews invented rock and roll?\n\nOh-oh. Here they come, the angry emailers who don't understand the concept of hyperbole. What ethnic group are we bringing down this time with our unfounded claims?\n\nFine, here you go, no hyperbole needed: Did you know that Jews invented \"rock and roll\"?\n\nWhat difference do the quotes make? Well, now we're not talking about rock and roll per se, but rather the term \"rock and roll\", which was coined by disc jockey Alan \"Moondog\" Freed (half Jewish, half Welsh, 0% canine, as far as we know).\n\nFreed had a huge part in playing and promoting \"black\" music to white Americans, music he labeled \"rock and roll\". He started out in Cleveland in the 1940s and moved to New York City a decade later, bringing rock and roll — the music and the term — with him.\n\nAnd yes, angry emailers, he was not the one to invent the term. Although the origins are not clear, they date back to at least the 1920s. But without Freed, it's highly unlikely that the moniker would have stuck the way it did — or if it would even apply to the same thing.\n\nNow, there is another theory that it wasn't Freed to first said \"rock and roll\" on the air, but rather Leo Mintz, a record store owner who sponsored Freed's show and sometimes appeared on it. But that wouldn't change anything, would it?\n\nFor Jews invented \"rock and roll\".\n\nOh, to hell with it. Jews invented rock and roll. Damn the angry emailers.",
