  "description": "So, the US national team pathetically missed the World Cup, throwing the country's soccer into disarray, with fingers pointing in every direction and no solution to be found. Wait and see, we guess.\n\nA new national coach will be hired at some point. As of this writing, Dave Sarachan has the job on an interim basis. A good MLS coach in his day, he will not keep the job full-time, just serve as a bridge to whoever comes next.\n\nOf course, Sarachan is Jewish, and we already profiled him years ago. He is not the first Jew to coach the US national team; that would be Erno Schwarz.\n\nThe Budapest-born Schwarz started as a player in the 1920s, first locally (he was capped for the Hungarian national team), then moving to the famed Hakoah Vienna club. He then made his way to the US, where he put down roots. Eventually, Schwarz turned to coaching, and was in charge of the US national team as they tried to qualify for the 1958 World Cup.\n\nDuring that qualification, the US went 0-4, was swept by Mexico and (believe it or not) Canada, outscored 21 goals to five. So, as bad as the state of American soccer seems now, it definitely has been worse...\n\nNot that it makes us feel any better.",
