  "description": "In 1996, Hollywood decided to resurrect \"Mission: Impossible\". The somewhat popular television series ended 23 years earlier, in 1973 (yes, there was a revival in the late 1980s, but no one remembers that one).\n\nThe original M:I starred a bunch of people you might have heard of: Martin Landau, Leonard Nimoy, Peter Graves, Sam Elliott. Landau's then-wife Barbara Bain was the show's \"main girl\", winning three consecutive Emmys. She and Landau quit M:I after season 3.\n\nIn any case, in the 90s, M:I was turned into a series of blockbuster movies, starring Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and a rotating cast of women, some more forgettable than others. This year's edition, entitled \"Mission: Impossible Something Something Day of Something Part One\" is the sixth (seventh? Who can keep track!) edition.\n\nIt's 2023, and Part Two is coming out next year, which means that the resurrected franchise has lasted 28 years â€” more than the original gap.\n\nHollywood has been out of original ideas for a long, long time.",
