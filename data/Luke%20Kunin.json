  "description": "We recently received a letter in our mailbox asking us to profile hockey player Luke Kunin because the correspondent \"doesn't know any Jew named Luke\". Hmmmm.\n\nLuke is a pretty goyishe name, isn't it, with its New Testament connections. Of course, so are John (and there are Jewish Johns; sure, Jews prefer Jonathan, but there are definitely Jewish Johns), Mark (there are many Jewish Marks), and Matthew (ditto). And you know what name is even more goyishe? Chris, and we have profiled a bunch of Jewish Chrises! (And even a Jewish Christine!)\n\nBut Luke... yeah, there are not too many Jewish Lukes. There is Luke Skywakler, of course, but he is neither Jewish nor real. Wikipedia lists hundreds of people named Luke, but no one obviously Jewish jumps out.\n\nSo here's Luke Kunin, a respectable but not remarkable hockey player, now with San Jose and previously with Nashville and Minnesota. A rare Jewish Luke.\n\nOh! We've actually profiled another Jewish Luke! Luke Hughes... another hockey player.",
