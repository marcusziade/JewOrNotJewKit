  "description": "We're not great at math here at JONJ. That's OK. We're good at other things, like figuring out Jews. Unfortunately this means we're only half-suited for explaining mathematician Georg Cantor. \n\nPer Wikipedia:\n\nCantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are \"more numerous\" than the natural numbers. In fact, Cantor's theorem implies the existence of an \"infinity of infinities\".\n\nYeah, we have no clue what the heck they're talking about. But that's ok, because Cantor's Judaism is just as complex and that's right in our wheelhouse. \n\nCantor sure sounds like a Jewish name and his Russian/German background seems to fit. Judaism even figures into his work: Cantor's choice of symbol for his cardinal numbers was a Hebrew aleph, a designation which is still used today.\n\nOn the other hand, Cantor was raised Lutheran. Though Cantor referred to his paternal grandparents as \"Israelites,\" his father was educated at a Lutheran mission. No luck on the mother's side either, she was baptized Catholic.  \n\nSounds complex, but we can provide an easy solution. Cantor has Jewish roots on his father's side, though his grandparents clearly converted so Cantor wasn't raised that way. Jewish blood, no Jewish religion. Easy as pi.\n\nAs for decrypting the mathematics part of this equation, well, we're sorry, but you're on your own.",
