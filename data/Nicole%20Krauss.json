  "description": "Let's suppose, that by some grand stroke of luck, you and your significant other share a profession. Maybe you met at a work function. Or you were introduced by a friend who thought your similar occupations would provide a great touching-off point. Or you are rival book store owners who anonymously lust for each other online. Who knows, these things happen.\n\nSo let's suppose you get home from work, a tough day in the office, and there she (he) is, your significant other, with a tough day behind her (him)... Doesn't that sound wonderful? Wouldn't you want to hear the problems they were having? Or will their problems just seem like repetitions of your own, and really, dear, all I want when I get home is to relax, G-D DAMN IT, so please, please, I BEG YOU, CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT WORK!!! PLEASE???\n\nYeah. We thought so. Or, who knows, maybe it's different in each case. Maybe some people, such as author Nicole Krauss, married to author Jonathan Safran Foer, both award winners, both Jews, both constantly near the top of lists of great young American authors, make the whole arrangement work.\n\nAnd no, this profile is not personal at all. Why do you ask?\n\n(Editor's update: They divorced.)",
