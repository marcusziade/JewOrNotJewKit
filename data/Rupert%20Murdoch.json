  "description": "There are many, many prominent Australian Jews. Let's do a little rundown.\n\nActress Isla Fisher. That's a good one.\n\nTable tennis player David Zalcberg. Two-time Olympian.\n\nAnd... ummmm. Hmmmm.\n\nAustralian Jews.... Hmmmm. Give us a minute here. Billionaire mogul Rubert Murdoch, maybe?\n\nWell, it depends on who you believe. According to some out there, Rubert's great-great-grandmother, Caroline Jemima Sherson, was Jewish. But considering that research found that the young Jemima was baptized before she was one year old, we highly doubt those first-mentioned sources.\n\nOf course, it's possible that Jemima's parents were Jewish and converted, but this puts us in the 1700s. So even if there is that Jewish link, it's long been dissipated.\n\nSo.... Australian Jews. Anyone heard of astronomer Bryan Gaensler? Author Elliot Perlman? Painter Judy Cassab? Many prominent Australian Jews indeed.",
