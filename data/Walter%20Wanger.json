  "description": "Walter Wanger shot his wife's lover... in the balls. We'll let that sink in.\n\nWanger was a Hollywood producer from the 1920s into the 60s. He put out dozens of films, but, you know, Jewish movie producers who anglicized their name are dime a dozen. Those who shoot their wife's lover... in the balls? Not many.\n\nWagner would go on to claim temporary insanity, serve just four months in jail, and return to making more movies. His career ended with the disastrous \"Cleopatra\" in 1963.\n\nHe and his wife remained married for 12 years after the shooting.\n\nWe guess it's not that easy to leave your husband, especially if he shot your lover...\n\nIn the balls.",
