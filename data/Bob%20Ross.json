  "description": "Bob Ross was born in the happy little town of Daytona Beach, Florida. After a happy little childhood, he decided to enroll in the Air Force.\n\nBob was sent to the happy little state of Alaska, where he became fascinated with the happy little landscapes, the snowy mountains and the clear streams. He also realized that a career in the military would not exactly be little or happy.\n\nSo Bob grew a Jewfro and became a painter, turning that love of nature into happy little pictures. He then got a happy little show on PBS, \"The Joy of Painting\". For 11 happy little years, Bob taught America how to paint.\n\nThere were happy little mountains, and happy little streams, and happy little bushes, and happy little clouds. And every time Bob made a mistake, he'd put a happy little smile on his face and transpose the gaffe into something pretty.\n\nBob passed away from cancer in 1995.\n\nIf only this story had a happy little ending.",
