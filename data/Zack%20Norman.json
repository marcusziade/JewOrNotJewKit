  "description": "We were watching \"Romancing the Stone\" for the 27th time...\n\nWhat? Surprised? We LOVE \"Romancing the Stone\". We even mentioned it in the Kathleen Turner profile. Thanks for paying attention!\n\nAnyway, we were watching Romancing the Stone for the 27th time, when it hit us: the bad guys are Jewish!\n\nThe bad guys are played by Danny DeVito and Zack Norman, named in the movie Ralph and Ira. That's right, Ira! How can a goy be named Ira? Fine, Ralph is under suspicion, and the two are cousins, so it's possible DeVito's character is half or something. Doesn't matter: Ira = Jew. Helps that Norman (real name Howard Zuker, best known for this movie but also a successful Hollywood producer) is a Jew in real life as well.\n\nThe movie also has one of the greatest scenes in film history, when an arm gets bitten off by a crocodile. What, we spoiled it for you?\n\nYou mean, you've never watched \"Romancing the Stone\"?",
