  "description": "We've gotten a couple of emails telling us that Gru, the supervillain protagonist of the animated movie \"Despicable Me\", is stereotypically Jewish. Gru has a big nose, talks with an Eastern European accent, and has mommy issues. An investigation was necessary.\n\nSo we watched the movie, and rather enjoyed it (spoiler alert: the villain turns out to have a heart of gold), but Gru's Jewishness? We just don't see it. Big nose, sure, but it's not drawn to be stereotypically Jewish. Eastern European accent, sure, but there are many, many Eastern European goyim. Mommy issues, sure, but Gru's mother is depicted as an overbearing shrew, and everyone knows Jewish mothers are not like that. Shrews, that is. Of course they are overbearing.\n\nNow, if we give it some thought, the Eastern European accent does lead us somewhere. And when you add Gru's black attire and his overwhelming desire to wreak evil on mankind, it can only mean one thing:\n\nGru is German.\n\nSo much for stereotypes?",
