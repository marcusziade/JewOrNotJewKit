  "description": "Did you know that without Barbara Liskov, this website would be completely different?\n\nAll the way back in 1974, Liskov, a computer science pioneer, created a programming language called CLU. While CLU is not exactly used today, many languages that followed drew on its principles. These include C++, Java, and Python. This website is written in Java, so there you have it!\n\nIt goes beyond us, of course. The languages that grew out of CLU don't just encompass the majority of the Internet's websites. They are the basis for the bulk of the software that make computers — and therefore the modern world — function.\n\nThanks, Barbara! Now, this website's \"wonderful\" \"cutting-edge\" \"eye-pleasing\" design? That's all us!",
