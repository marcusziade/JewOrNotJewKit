  "description": "Who is the most obscure profile on this website? It's probably between surfer Shaun Tomson, bullfighter Sidney Franklin, and Zev the Horse. Gotta go with the horse.\n\nWhoever it is doesn't come from the Actresses category. Here we have our pick of the litter, Jew or Not Jew.\n\nYet here we are, profiling... who exactly? Lorna what?\n\nLorna Patterson, best known for her role as Randy, the blond stewardess, in one of our favorite movies of all time, Airplane! You remember Randy, right?\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been so scared. And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.\"\n\nOh, poor Randy! Well, Lorna did better for herself, found a husband, and converted to Judaism for the marriage. As for her acting career? It pretty much fizzled after taking over for Goldie Hawn in the TV version of Private Benjamin.\n\nSo there you go. Lorna Patterson, little-known actress, surprising Jew, our most obscure profile ever?\n\nNah. We're still gonna go with the horse.",
