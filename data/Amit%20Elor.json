  "description": "Poor Kyrgyzstan.\n\nYes, you read this correctly. As we get close to the end of our Olympic coverage, we're writing about poor, poor Kyrgyzstan.\n\nKyrgyzstan, the favorite country on that quiz website Sporcle. Kyrgyzstan, known for bride kidnappings and donkey milk. Kyrgyzstan, who had never won an Olympic gold medal, but had a chance this week, when Meerim Zhu... Zhuma... Zhumanazarova wrestled Amit Elor for the title.\n\nPoor, poor Zhuma...nazarova. She had no chance. We don't think she had her hands around Elor once, who easily won in a shutout.\n\nElor (seriously, this is really not about Kyrgyzstan!) is an American-born daughter of Israeli immigrants, and an absolute kick-ass on the wrestling mat. She has two world titles to go with the new Olympic gold. After dominating every opponent, including Zhumasomething, Elor is the first Jewish woman to ever win a wrestling medal. (Considering she is only 20, we would bet on her becoming the second Jewish female wrestling medalist as well.)\n\nBut back to Kyrgyzstan... Did you know that we haven't profiled a single Kyrgyz Jew?\n\nPoor, poor Kyrgyzstan.",
