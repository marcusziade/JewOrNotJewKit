  "description": "Last year, \"The Blind Side\" looked like a formulaic movie that managed to tug on America's heartstrings and win Sandra Bullock a once-thought-impossible Oscar.\n\nYou know the story: white family takes in a troubled black teen. There are problems at first, but at the end, everyone learns from each other. Teen becomes football star. White mother gets sanctified. Tears fly.\n\nBleh.\n\nYou know what would make it better? One doesn't have to look far to find an example. We'll stay with the NFL, and new New York Giant, former Tennessee Titan Keith Bulluck (no relation to Sandra). He, like Michael Oher of \"The Blind Side\", was taken in by a family as a teen. Only in Bulluck's case, the family was Jewish.\n\nNo, Bullock's new family didn't make him convert to Judaism (hooray for tolerance!), but he did live out the life of a Jewish teen. So here was young Keith, the only black face in a synagogue. Young Keith, trying to figure out Hebrew letters. Young Keith, looking for matzoh at Passover. Young Keith, becoming a football star (OK, no longer the life of a Jewish teen there).\n\nWhy wasn't that made into a movie?",
