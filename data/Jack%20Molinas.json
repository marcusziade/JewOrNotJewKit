  "description": "In 1953, Jack Molinas, a basketball star at Columbia University (1953 is the last time those words were used together), was selected in the top 5 of the NBA draft. He played so well for the Fort Wayne Pistons that he was chosen for the All-Star Game.\n\nBut Molinas didn't play in that game. In fact, he didn't play in the NBA ever again, his career cut short after 32 games. No, he didn't die (yet). Molinas was banned for gambling.\n\nWhile in college, Molinas was allegedly involved in the 1951 point-shaving scandal at another New York institution, CCNY, but was not caught. He was caught in the NBA, however, for betting on his own team. Forced to play in the minor leagues, Molinas turned to, what else... gambling.\n\nMolinas was the ringleader of perhaps the largest gambling scam in American sport history, the 1961 point-shaving scandal that involved 22 college teams and at least 37 players. For that, he served five years in jail, got out, and turned to, no, not gambling... smuggling and pornography.\n\nOn August 3, 1975, the end came for Jack Molinas. He was shot in the back of the head in his own backyard. The murder was never solved, but a mob hit was not ruled out. (You don't say...)\n\nAs Wikipedia helpfully points out, Molinas holds the NBA record for least games played for an all-star player. That's one way of putting it!",
