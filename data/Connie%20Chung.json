  "description": "Isn't this what Jew or Not Jew is all about? Did you really think that you will find out today that... Connie Chung is Jewish? Connie Chung?\n\nIt's not exactly Marilyn Monroe converting to Judaism after marrying Arthur Miller. It's not even close to being in the same ballpark. But it's out there, and we're acknowledging it. Yes, Connie Chung, Mrs. Maury Povich, is now Jewish.\n\nOh sure, her score is low. It would have been much higher 15 years ago, but first there was Newt Gingrich's mom, then there were the Oklahoma City comments, and then her overall fall into irrelevance and obscurity.\n\nBut then, profiling someone irrelevant and obscure has never stopped us before. Especially if they're so surprisingly Jewish.",
