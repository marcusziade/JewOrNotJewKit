  "description": "To those of us who recognize the man pictured on the left, Ron Jeremy needs no introduction.\n\nFew men can match the length and breadth of Jeremy's storied career. A former school teacher, he's been spreading pleasure to fans of fine films everywhere since the late 1970s.\n \nNot known for his good looks, Ron plays the everyman — the copy machine repairman, the plumber, the pool boy, the television repairman — in his pictures, giving his fans the ability to fantasize that it's them who's appearing in the role.\n \nBeyond starring in movies, Jeremy has appeared in music videos, television shows and even video games. Who, er, what will he do next? Who knows. But you have to figure it's gonna be something good.\n\nBecause Ron Jeremy is a man who knows how to come out on top.",
