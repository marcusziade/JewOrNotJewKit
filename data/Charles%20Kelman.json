  "description": "You might have seen the brouhaha earlier this year about Columbus' supposed Jewish roots. Long story short, after some grave-digging it was determined that Chris' son had DNA that is \"compatible with Jewish origin\". That proves absolutely nothing, but what can you do. Hogwash like that sells newspapers gets links clicked.\n\nWhat does this have to do with today's profile, Charles Kelman? We'll get to that. Kelman is best known for being a pioneer of cataract surgery. Phacoemulsification, a process he invented, has been the method used worldwide since 1978. He was even named Ophthalmologist of the Century! Can't argue with credentials like that.\n\nBut Kelman had another dream... and that dream was Broadway. After singing on The Tonight Show in the 1970s, he became a semi-popular musician. Kelman appeared on various TV programs and performed alongside the likes of Dizzie Gillespie and Glen Campbell. And then — yes! — Broadway, co-producing hits(?) like \"Can-Can\" and \"The Sound of Music\".\n\nSo what has all of that to do with Columbus? Well, back in 1992, Kelman wrote a musical, \"The Marrano\", where he supposed that Columbus was a Jew. (No, it didn't make it to Broadway...) That's 32 years before the grave-digging!\n\nStill a bunch of hogwash.",
