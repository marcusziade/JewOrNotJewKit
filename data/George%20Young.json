  "description": "Every year, the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum confers the George Young Award to that individual, Jewish or non-Jewish, who has best replicated George's voluminous and resplendent ears.\n\nThis year's honoree: Dumbo the Elephant! Congrats Dumbo! Yes, Dumbo has time and again impressed us with his ability to utilize his lobes, with and without his magical flying feather, in the service of others. \n\nSure, Dumbo's ears may not yet be as grandiose as George's, but we know the big grey galoot will get there some day.\n\nOf course, some people will tell you that the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame gives the George Young Award to those people who best represent the high ideals of one George Young, the former General Manager of the New York (Football) Giants.\n\nBut considering that George wasn't even a smidgeon Jewish — and his only listed \"high ideal\" was that of building a winning football team, hardly a holiest of holies — that doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense, now does it?",
