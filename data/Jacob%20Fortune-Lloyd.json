  "description": "We really liked the new \"Bodies\" series on Netflix, which checks a lot of our favorite tropes: Murder mysteries. Multiple timelines. Dysfunctional families. Time loops. Sad detectives. European accents. Stopping the apocalypse. (Wait, are we talking about \"Dark\"? No, we're not, because:) Jews. (\"Dark\" was German. There were no Jews on \"Dark\".)\n\nThere are Jews on \"Bodies\"! Well, there are at least two Jews on \"Bodies\": previously-profiled Shira Haas and currently-profiled Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, who play two of these sad detectives in two of these multiple timelines. (As an aside, have you noticed how many younger Brits have hyphenated last names? Seems to be a trend.)\n\nOne of Fortune-Lloyd's (boy, these hyphenated names are a mouthful) first screen roles was an unnamed Sith officer in a Star Wars sequel, so we guess this is a major step up. In \"Bodies\", he actually gets a name... even two! Fortune-Lloyd plays the one on-screen Jew in the series, sad detective Charles (Karl) Whiteman (Weissman). In fact, him being Jewish plays a major role in the plot.\n\nSo, if you're into all that... watch \"Bodies\"!",
