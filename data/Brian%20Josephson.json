And yet, it's real!\n\nNobelitis, or \"Nobel disease\", is what happens when a Nobel Prize goes to one's head. Seriously, it's a thing. Look it up. Nobelitis. Basically, once you (well not YOU, obviously) win the Nobel, you can do no wrong, and come up with all kinds of cuckoo ideas. You won the Nobel! People listen to you!\n\nThere are many examples, but we are here to discuss Brian Josephson, a rare Welsh Jew. He won the Physics Nobel in 1973 for work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling. Later in life, he got struck by a massive case of multiple Nobelitis. For example, he decided that water can \"remember\" the properties of chemicals that dilute in it. (We don't remember much from high school chemistry, but... NO!) He also decided that humans can communicate through telepathy. Hey Brian, what are we thinking of right now?\n\n(That being said, if you, the reader of this website, actually are suffering from Nobelitis, please drop us an email!)",
