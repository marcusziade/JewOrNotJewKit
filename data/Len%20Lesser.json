  "description": "What's the Jewiest network TV show of all time? \"Seinfeld\", right? Well, did you know that it could have been... even Jewier?\n\nThat's right; NBC executives felt that the pilot was \"too New York\", and by \"too New York\" they did not mean \"too Italian\". So when the series started to air, concessions had to be made.\n\nAlright, to be fair, since the incredibly stubborn Larry David was involved, we're not sure if he would ever admit to concessions. That being said, the show got their goys. Of the four protagonists, Jerry was the only one left carrying the Jewish flame.\n\nAnd yet we wonder... what could have been? Could Jerry and George reminisce about days in Jewish summer camp? Could Elaine have been written as Jewish? Could Kramer kvetch about starving on Yom Kuppur? Could Uncle Leo, one of the Jewiest supporting characters in TV history, be more prominent?\n\nWho knows. But David got his way: he went on to make \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"... The Jewiest TV show of all time, period.",
