  "description": "Scooter Libby's real first name is shrouded in mystery. It's listed as \"I.\", which could be \"Isaac\". Or \"Ira\". Or \"Irving\". Or \"Israel\". Or something else super-Jewish.\n\nBecause, ladies and gentlemen, Scooter Libby is a Jew. He just tries his darnedest to hide it. \n\nTo think of it, that \"Libby\" sounds funny as well. It's probably \"Leibowitz\". Or \"Lyubavitch\".\n\nSo you can run, Scooter, but you can't hide. (His first name is, in fact, \"Irv\".) Although... we wish you'd hide. The less people know that you're Jewish, the better. But then... why did we bring this up in the first place?\n\nWhat's really important to us at Jew or Not Jew? To expose the Jews out there at any cost? Is it really worth it? Isn't it better in this case to let sleeping dogs lie and allow Scooter to just be Scooter?\n\nAh, fine. We'll live with out decision. Just don't tell us that Karl Rove is really \"Rothstein\".",
