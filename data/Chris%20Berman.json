  "description": "Lots of opinions about Chris Berman out there.\n\nChris Berman is very popular. He is a highly esteemed announcer and studio host on ESPN.\n\nChris Berman is very annoying. His catch phrases are uninspiring, his stuttering is tiresome, and his nicknames are irritating.\n\nChris Berman is a good family man. He is married and has two children.\n\nChris Berman is a two-timing jackass with a known affection for women in leather.\n\nWell, one thing about Chris Berman we can't argue about.\n\nChris Berman is Jewish. Yes, that's right, CHRIS Berman. Not only are both his parents Jewish (seriously, what real Jews would name their son Chris... Come on here, folks. That should be grounds for immediate excommunication), but Chris and his family practice Judaism as well.\n\nAfter all these opinions, isn't it nice to have one fact?",
