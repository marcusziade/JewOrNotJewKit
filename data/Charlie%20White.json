  "description": "Are you going to watch Olympic ice dancing, dear readers? Of course not, you say? Well, we're gonna give you a reason!\n\nNo, previously profiled Jewish medalist Ben Agosto is no longer competing. But Charlie White is!\n\nWhite, a silver medalist in Vancouver, is one of the favorites in Sochi. And when he won that silver medal, his grandmother called a local radio station and proclaimed that her grandson is Jewish! Various Jewish publications picked up on that and celebrated that rare Jewish winter medalist!\n\nNot so fast.\n\nApparently, White's grandmother was a tad overzealous. Charlie isn't Jewish. SHE is, converting after marrying her second husband. In fact, Charlie is a proud Christian.\n\nAs if you needed another reason NOT to watch Olympic ice dancing.",
