  "description": "We don't know what we're gonna be doing at the age of 90.\n\nWe might be sitting on our porch, sipping lemonade, sneering at passing teenagers with their thingamajigs and whatsits, and rambling about the good old days of the Internets and airplanes and meat not made from soy...\n\nOr, maybe, we're gonna lose it completely, and drool away in a retirement... You know, let's not talk about this scenario.\n\nOr, you know, we might be dead.\n\nOne thing for sure: we will not be winning Nobel Prizes. We are not gonna pull a Leo Hurwicz.\n\nLet that sink in. Hurwicz was honored for Economics AT THE AGE OF 90. He was not only the oldest Jew to win a Nobel, he was the oldest laureate ever.\n\nYeah, that's not happening.\n\nNow get off our lawn!",
