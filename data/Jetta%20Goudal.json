  "description": "Today, few have heard of Jetta Goudal, but in the 1920s, she was one of the leading ladies of silent cinema. The Dutch-born Julie Goudeket moved to America, hid her Jewishness, pretended to be French, and became a star of the silver screen.\n\nIf someone today does remember Goudal, it's probably in conjunction with Cecil B. DeMille. The famed filmmaker made a number of movies starring the actress, but it didn't last. DeMille refused to work with Goudal, proclaiming her to be difficult and tearing up her contract. She took him to court and, surprisingly, won.\n\nDid that restore her career? Quite the opposite. Other producers and directors were afraid that she would sue THEM, so no one would hire Goudal. A big star of the 1920s was pretty much out of Hollywood by 1930. Goudal did live until the ripe old age of 93, so perhaps she had the last laugh.\n\nAnd now you have heard of Jetta Goudal!",
