  "description": "Bryan Cranston's life was changed forever by a little television show called \"Airwolf\". You didn't expect that one, did you?\n\nWhat is \"Airwolf\", you ask? Oh, you missed out! It was an 80s classic, a show about a high-tech helicopter named Airwolf and its crew... OK, not exactly a classic. Anyway, we highly recommend you find the opening theme on Youtube. It might be the most 80s thing ever.\n\nIn any case, Cranston wasn't exactly a regular. He played the villain of the week on one episode. So how did his life change? He met the woman who would become his wife... she was playing the hostage of the week. They just don't make shows like this anymore!\n\nOf course, Cranston's career had somewhat of an upswing since \"Airwolf\", as he appeared on a couple of other little television shows, won a crapload of Emmys, and now has an Oscar nomination to boot. But we all gotta start somewhere, right?\n\nHere's something else you didn't expect: Cranston is at least 1/8 Jewish!",
