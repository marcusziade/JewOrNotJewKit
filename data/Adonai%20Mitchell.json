  "description": "\"Jewish\" words used for names by goyim, ranked by how unlikely Jews themselves are to use them: (We've already profiled many of these!)\n\nISRAEL Kamakawiwo'ole, musician. At this point, the goyim have pretty much appropriated \"Israel\". Oh well.\nALIYAH Boston, basketball player. She is not enacting the Law of Return anytime soon.\nHANNUKKAH Wallace, bobsledder. At least we would spell it right.\nSHALOM Harlow, model. Or, if you want, SHALOM Luani, football player. Works for goyishe girls and boys!\nRABBI Matondo, soccer player. Sure, it's pronounced \"Rab-ee\". As. If!\nTORAH Bright, snowboarder. \"Tora\" by itself might be fine, but once you add that \"h\", you're encroaching.\nZAYDE Wisdom, hockey player. That's his name. Grandfather Wisdom. We're just gonna shrug.\nELOHIM Prandi, handball player. Oh, Elohim is such a no-no...\nADONAI Mitchell, football player. But is Elohim a bigger no-no than Adonai? How will Orthodox Jews who cover the NFL write about the wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts? It's a real problem!\nJEW Don Boney, politician. No.",
