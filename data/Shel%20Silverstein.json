  "description": "One of the little trade secrets about Jew or Not Jew is the queue. \n\nWhenever we get an idea, or one is suggested by an intrepid reader, we write it down and store it \"in the queue\": an electronic list of anyone and everyone we'd like to write about, but haven't gotten around to yet.\n\nMost of the time these get picked back up in a couple of days and written. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Shel Silverstein has been in the queue since we started the site, which, as of today, means he's been sitting there for two years.\n\nTwo years! How could we let this happen? It's not that we don't like Shel Silverstein. Actually, we LOVE Shel Silverstein. The Giving Tree. The Missing Piece. These are all-time, childhood-defining classics. The man even wrote a poem about Captain Hook trying to pick his nose. You just can't top that.\n\nSo how'd he get lost in the queue for so long? The truth is, there just isn't that much to say: He's a Jew. He's great. Life moves on. \n\nWho'd have thought it'd take two years just to write that?",
