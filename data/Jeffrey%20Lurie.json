  "description": "When a new owner buys a sports team, changes are usually afoot. Coaches can get fired, stadiums can get built, colors can get changed...\n\nAnd while fans are usually OK with coaching changes (the coach usually sucks!) and new stadiums (until they find out that they, as the taxpayer, foot the bill), a color change? DISASTER!\n\nWhat are you to do as a fan who spent years color-coding everything from their socks to bedroom wall paint? Talk about a catastrophe!\n\nSo you can understand the revulsion of the Philadelphia Eagles fans, when, after buying the team in 1994, Jeffrey Lurie, at the urging of his wife, changed the colors. You see, Christina Lurie (Jewish like her husband, despite that name) hated the Eagles' green, so she changed it to... green. A different shade of green, that is! Philly fans have hated it ever since (of course, Philly fans hate pretty much everything), even when their team finally won the Super Bowl wearing... well, green. Bring back (the other) green, they keep begging!\n\nWell, a few years ago Lurie made a change himself, ditching Christina for a woman two decades younger. The old green will actually come back soon as an alternate jersey... Perhaps the new Mrs. Lurie asked for it?",
