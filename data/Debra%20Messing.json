  "description": "You may remember Miss Messing from her appearance as Beth on \"Seinfeld\", specifically for the following exchange:\n\nBeth: Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?\n\nJerry: What?\n\nBeth: A dentist. (They laugh)\n\nJerry: That's a good one. Dentists.\n\nBeth: Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews.\n\nAnd yet, the woman is best known for playing the Jewish Grace on \"Will and Grace\", the wildly popular sitcom that introduced mainstream America to homosexuals and Megan Mullally (the latter's evil washing out whatever good the former's was). Messing is Jewish, and, because Messing insisted with the creators, Grace was Jewish too.\n\nSo how do you reconcile that, Debra? Hm? Hey, we don't mind a little self-contradiction ourselves. After all, people pick on Jews and blacks all the time. But dentists? \n\nThat's just begging for a root canal.",
