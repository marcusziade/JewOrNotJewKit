Double bogey now.\"\n\n\"And now he's become one of the most openly religious players on the tour, spreading his born-again Christianity to anyone who'll listen.\"\n\n\"Ugh, and that's triple bogey for Pavin. Awful awful showing here.\"\n\n\"Just painful to watch a good player collapse like that, Jim. It really is.\"",
