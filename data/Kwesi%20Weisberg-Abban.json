  "description": "Netflix's \"Away\" is a mostly-good, sometimes-sappy, often-excellent show about mankind's first mission to Mars. The astronauts, led by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, represent the best of humanity. There are five of them: an American, a Russian, a Brit, an Indian, and a Chinese. Is one of them a Jew? You bet!\n\nUsually, we have to wait a few episodes or even seasons for the James Wilson Law to rear its head; on \"Away\", it reveals the answer by the end of the pilot. So who is the Jew?\n\nIs it Emma (Swank), the American commander? Misha, played by an actual Jew, Soviet-born Israeli Mark Ivanir? Kwesi, the Ghanian-born British botanist? Ram, the Indian pilot? Or Lu, the stoic Chinese chemist? Surprise! It's Kwesi. (Well, not much of a surprise, since it's his profile. Such is our website's format.)\n\nIn fact, in later episodes, Kwesi's Jewishness is given a backstory, when we find out that he was orphaned and adopted by a Jewish family. In true James Wilson fashion, he even celebrates Chanukah when others embrace Christmas.\n\nThanks for making this one easy for us, Netflix.",
