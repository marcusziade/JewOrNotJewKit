Here, we just did it again. And again!\n\nSo let's us say it one more time:\n\nWe have absolutely NO PROBLEMS with goyishe actors playing Jews. None. Zero. Zilch. Insert other synonyms here.\n\nApparently, some other Jews do. Their latest target is Kathryn Hahn, a goyishe actress who has recently played a rabbi, but now has encroached on the holiest of holies: being cast as Joan Rivers in a biopic.\n\nAll this seems ridiculous to us. Hahn has terrific comic timing and will do a fine job as Joan, regardless of her lack of Jewishness.\n\nWE are sure of that.",
