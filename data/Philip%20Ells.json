  "description": "Where the hell is Tuvalu?\n\n... is not a question often asked. We claim to know geography, but we can't point it out on a map. It's north of Fiji and west of the Solomon Islands... does that help?\n\nTuvalu, with an area of 10 square miles, is the fourth smallest independent nation in the world. Needless to say, there aren't many Jews on its secluded shores; in fact, it's quite likely there aren't ANY Jews in Tuvalu. But there was one!\n\nMeet Philip Ells, an English lawyer who is currently the Head of the School of Law at the University of West London. In the 1990s, Ells spent three years in Tuvalu as the country's public defender. You read that right: he was the lawyer for the ENTIRE country. A country whose population barely breaks 10,000...\n\nElls, in his role as \"The People's Lawyer\", had to deal with murder, incest, and all-important pig theft. He wrote all about his strange experiences in a book, appropriately titled \"Where The Hell Is Tuvalu?\".\n\nWell, now you know.",
