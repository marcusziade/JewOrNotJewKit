  "description": "Let's talk about \"Exodus\". Not Exodus, \"Exodus\".\n\n\"Exodus\", Leon Uris' seminal novel about the creation of the state of Israel, a work of fiction that topped the best-seller list for months. A book about, well, an exodus of European Jews to Israel.\n\n\"Exodus\" was incredibly popular not only in America, but also abroad. One country where it wasn't published was, obviously, the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, it was sneaked into the USSR and translated. Soviet Jews meticulously copied and distributed the book underground; \"Exodus\" hit home. It hit home so much that it inspired many of its Soviet readers to do what once unthinkable: leave behind family, friends, culture, history, and go to Israel.\n\nSo, we just talked about \"Exodus\". And, also, Exodus.",
