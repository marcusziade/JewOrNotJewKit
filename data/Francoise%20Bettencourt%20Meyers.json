  "description": "In a profile written (Jebus!) 16 years ago, we tried to find the world's richest Jew. At the time, it was casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, now dead. We then wondered if we're related. (Spoiler alert: we're not. Although, since all Asheknazi Jews share common ancestry... let's just move on.)\n\nToday, we're profiling the richest Jewish woman in the world, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers. At the time of writing, she is worth north of $100 billion. Damn. One hundred billion! We give up. What's even the point...\n\nAnyway, Bettencourt Meyers is an heiress to the L'Oreal cosmetic fortune, but, in a cruel twist of fate, that brand is not exactly Jewish. L'Oreal's founder, Eugene Schueller, was an antisemite and Nazi collaborator. And he was Francoise's grandfather, which means...\n\nFrancoise is a Jew through marriage. Originally a devout Catholic, she converted when wedding Jean-Pierre Meyers, whose rabbi grandfather perished at Auschwitz. Let's just say that the Schuellers were not exactly pleased with the change.\n\nWell, we know one thing for sure:\n\nWe're not related to Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.",
