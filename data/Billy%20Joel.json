  "description": "The Piano Man. The Entertainer. The Jew?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nSadly, our hope of a Jewish Billy the Kid is only floating down The River of Dreams. Yes, both of Billy's parents were Jewish, but he went to a Catholic church, got baptized (Don't Ask Us Why), and he's currently Keeping The Faith in an Atheist State of Mind.\n\nSo the Angry Young Man will just have to remain The Stranger to Torah and temple. Oh well. We'll admit we're disappointed, but we're not gonna drink a bottle of Captain Jack over it.\n\nAfter all Billy, we love you Just The Way You Are.",
