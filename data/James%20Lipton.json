  "description": "James Lipton used to be a pimp.\n\nYes, James Lipton. The host of \"Inside the Actors Studio\". The old man who interviews actors, fawns over them, and asks questions about their favorite sound. That James Lipton. He used to be a pimp.\n\nAs Lipton tells it, he was in Paris after World War II, and it was hard to find a job. He befriended a prostitute; when his money ran out, the woman set him up to \"represent\" her. He ended up \"representing\" a whole bordello. \"It was a great year of my life,\" he says.\n\nSo, yes, Lipton talks freely about that. About his Jewish heritage?\n\nNot a peep.\n\nMaybe someone should interview him.",
