  "description": "If one was to create the all-time all-Jewish NFL team (an exercise too nerdy even for us, but hell, let's give it a whirl), one would start with Hall of Famer Sid Luckman at quarterback. Another Hall of Famer, Ron Mix, anchors the offensive line. Four-time Super Bowl champion Randy Grossman lines up at tight end...\n\nOn offense, our biggest problem (yes, even more than wide receiver) would be at running back. Jews haven't exactly excelled at the position, even in the old days.\n\nThe best candidate seems to be Marshall Goldberg. Starting in 1939, he spent a decade with the Chicago Cardinals, interrupted by service in World War II. In 1941, Goldberg was third in the NFL in rushing, and was named second-team All-Pro. In 1947, he helped the Cardinals to their last NFL title. His number has been retired by the team (now in Arizona).\n\nOne small problem. For all his prowess at running back, Goldberg was an even better defensive back, grabbing league-leading seven interceptions during his All-Pro season. And, with all the problems at running back, finding quality Jewish defensive backs is even more difficult (Taylor Mays, alas)...\n\nWell, our all-Jewish coach will have to make Goldberg play BOTH positions. He did so in real life, didn't he?",
