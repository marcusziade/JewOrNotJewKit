  "description": "\"Time is a flat circle,\" Matthew McConaughey drawled on \"True Detective\", and we were immediately hooked. This, despite the banality of it all: aren't all circles flat by their mere definition?\n\nStill, \"True Detective\" was excellent. Watching McConaughey and pal Woody Harrelson roam the Louisiana backwaters in search for the Yellow King, we were enthralled. So was the audience: HBO decided that the supposedly-limited series would return for Season 2... and what a season it was!\n\nA whole new setting, a whole new atmosphere, a whole new cast: a completely unrelated story headlined by a terribly miscast Vince Vaughn as a crime boss. To call it wretched would be an understatement. Terrible writing, hammy acting, pointless detours... The flat circle was replaced by flat characters. We watched, waiting for it to get better. It didn't. And that was supposed to be it for \"True Detective\".\n\nNot so, said HBO, waiting three years to bring us Season 3. It turned out to be a great decision; as if Season 2 never happened. And while some complained that it was just taking Season 1's greatest hits and recycling them, it still had a life of its own. Mahershala Ali and the surprisingly Jewish Stephen Dorff took over the detective mantles, sprawling through the Arkansas hinterland. It might have not had the cache of the initial offering, but it was fascinating nonetheless.\n\nWill there be a Season 4?",
