  "description": "Buried deep within the halls of Castle Nudnik — in a windowless room filled with nothing but straw — a young blonde shiksa weeps over her spinning wheel.\n\nPoof! A swarthy, red-headed man appears.\n\nMan: \"Shiksa! Why do you cry so?\"\n\nShiksa: \"Gasp! It's you! Oh thank G-d! You have to help me!\"\n\nMan: \"I was just trying to get you to be quiet so I could get to sleep but, OK, sure. What can I do for you?\"\n\nShiksa: \"You don't know? I need to turn all this straw into gold.\"\n\nMan: \"What are you, meshuggenah? You want me to turn your spinning wheel into a 2002 Ferrari Enzo, while I'm at it?\"\n\nShiksa: \"But... in the stories  a magical imp appears and transforms the straw into gold to protect the girl from her king...\"\n\nMan: \"And I look like a magical imp? Oy, you Germans and your fakakta stereotypes. Look, my cousin down in the diamond district, he has some gold, maybe he helps you out? He'll give you a good rate!\"\n\nShiksa: \"Oh! Thank you! I think...\"\n\nMan: \"Anything for you, little shiksa. We'll solve this dilemma somehow or my name isn't Rumpelstilstein!\"\n\nShiksa: \"Ah HA! You told me your name! Now I don't have to give you anything in exchange!\"\n\nMan: \"Oy... I keep telling you I'm not that guy!\"",
