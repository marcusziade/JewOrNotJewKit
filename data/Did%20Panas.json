  "description": "Young kids are so entitled today, with their netflixes and disneyplusses... Just push a button and watch whatever garbage they desire!\n\nIn our days, we had three TV channels, and we were lucky if the rabbit ears got good reception!\n\nDo we sound like old men again? Alright, fine. So let's tell the story of another old man, Did (Grandpa) Panas, who was the primary source of TV entertainment for Ukrainian children for a good quarter century.\n\nSome of us are not exactly understating the three channels; that's pretty much what Soviet TV had. It was also all government controlled, with not much interest for children. So one had to watch the little that was available. In Ukraine, it was Did Panas, who read fairy tales. That's right. An old, mustached guy reading fairy tales on TV. That passed as entertainment. We're not judging.\n\nIn any case, Panas was beloved in Ukraine, but not much loved by the Soviet powers, because of his very ethnic Ukrainian vibe. That turned out to be a ruse: Panas was born with a very un-Ukrainian, very Jewy name of Pinchas Wexler.\n\nPanas was also a subject of a potentially apocryphal story, where he supposedly signed off with a phrase that can be loosely translated as \"that's bullshit, kids,\" swearing and all.\n\nNow that's quality children's television!",
