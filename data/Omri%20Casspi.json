  "description": "It's not often that a sports league's Jewish population doubles overnight.\n\nBy our count, there are currently six Jews in the NFL. So for that to double, Yeshiva College probably needs to beef up its football program. We don't see that happening any time soon.\n\nIn baseball, Jews are in the double digits. Doubling that? Not a chance.\n\nBut in the NBA, the Jews did double overnight. From... one to two.\n\nIt happened when Israeli-born Omri Casspi played in the Sacramento Kings season opener. Casspi came off the bench to score 15 points, but more importantly, became the NBA's second active Jew, joining the Lakers' Jordan Farmar.\n\nWhat will be the next sport to double? We're guessing golf... After all, twice zero is still zero.",
