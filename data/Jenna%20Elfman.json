  "description": "Our train of thought as we run into an article about the 2000 film \"Keeping the Faith\", starring Ben Stiller as a rabbi, Edward Norton as a priest, and Jenna Elfman as the love interest of both:\n\nWhy does anyone care about \"Keeping the Faith\"?\n\nWe saw this movie, right? Must have been on cable...\n\nThe cast was good, but the movie really had no idea what to do with itself...\n\nIf you're gonna pick someone to play a young rabbi, Stiller was probably a good choice...\n\nNeither him nor Norton had any chemistry with Elfman...\n\nIs Jenna Elfman related to Danny Elfman?\n\nYes, we remember she is, but it's not straightforward...\n\nWe profiled Jenna, right?\n\nNo? Seriously, closing in on 2900 profiles, it's hard to keep track...\n\nBut Danny is definitely profiled... How are they related again?\n\nLet's look this up. He is her uncle-in-law. Danny's nephew is married to Jenna.\n\nSo she is not Jewish...\n\nSeriously, why does anyone care about \"Keeping the Faith\"?\n\nWe didn't read that article.",
