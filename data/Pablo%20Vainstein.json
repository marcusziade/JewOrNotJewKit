  "description": "Apparently, Pablo Vainstein, who is playing handball for Argentina at the Rio Olympics, is Jewish. Which made us ponder (as it tends to do), who is the best Jewish handball player ever?\n\nEasy, we thought. Good old Google to the rescue. Well, good old Google had nothing. Oh, it did list numerous Jewish handball players, but let's clear up the confusion: there are two sports named handball. The American variety (ball against the wall) had its share of Jews. The international one (ball into net): nada.\n\nEven Wikipedia, and its elaborate (but not always correct) List of Jews in Sports did not have a handball section. (And yet, bowling and professional wrestling are listed. Anyway...) Our foray into Olympic rosters of years past didn't produce any viable candidates either.\n\nSo, does this make Vainstein the best Jewish handball player ever? Quite possible that he is the ONLY Jewish handball player ever...",
