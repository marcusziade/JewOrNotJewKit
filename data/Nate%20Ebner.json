  "description": "Rugby is back in the Olympics, after almost a century long absence! Can you feel the excitement?!\n\nMaybe there's some excitement in Fiji, which could win its first ever medal, but outside of that little island... not too much. The fact that the Olympics are going with rugby sevens is not exactly helping.\n\nRugby sevens is a trimmed-down version of the sport, played with seven players a side (as opposed to the regular 15). Imagine if the Olympics included two-on-two basketball instead of the regular one.\n\nThe US is participating, too! Of course, our rugby is not exactly at the apex. However, there is one team member whose name might be familiar: Nate Ebner, whose day job is playing in the NFL for the Patriots. He actually started out as a rugby player, before switching to football in college. Now, Ebner is taking a sabbatical for the Olympics. Good for him, we guess, if he can afford the paycut.\n\nOh, and Ebner is Jewish, just like his US teammate, Zack Test. Feel the excitement?",
