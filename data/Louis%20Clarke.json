  "description": "Louis \"Pinky\" Clarke was one of the best American sprinters of the early 1920s, but, when time came to name the Olympic team for Paris in 1924, it wasn't that simple. Despite his prowess, he was bypassed for all individual events in favor of goyim. Why? Well, no official reason is known, but the likely one starts with \"antise\" and ends with \"mitism\".\n\nFortunately, the United States couldn't stack its relay team with just goyim, so that's where Clarke came in. He led off the qualifying heat... the US set the world record. He led off the semifinal... the US broke the record again. He ran second in the final... the US tied its just-set record in route for gold.\n\nThat make Clarke the first ever Jewish American runner to stand atop the Olympic podium. Which is great and everything, but maybe those \"antise\" \"mites\" should have not taken away his chance at individual glory?",
