  "description": "Every few years, a new musical takes Broadway by storm. Every show is sold out, tickets cost an arm and a leg (even more than usual), the reseller market goes insane. Recently, it was \"The Book of Mormon\". Before that, \"The Producers\". Before... \"Phantom of the Opera\"? \"Cats\"? Yes, it was probably \"Cats\".\n\nThe latest is \"Hamilton\". You want a ticket? YOU CAN'T GET IT! You better know someone who knows someone, and then be prepared to empty your bank account. Oh, and make sure the ticket is not a forgery. That's been happening...\n\nFor those who are far removed from Broadway hoopla, \"Hamilton\" is the brainchild of Lin-Manuel Miranda (Not a Jew), and is not only a financial success, but a critical one as well. It recently pretty much swept the Tonys, winning 11 prizes. One of those went to Daveed Diggs (Jew), who plays both Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette. Diggs got a Grammy for his effort as well.\n\nSo, are we going to see this Broadway wonder? We'll pass, thank you. Our hard-earned money is better spent on... other things. Besides, we've seen \"Cats\". That's enough musical to last a lifetime...",
