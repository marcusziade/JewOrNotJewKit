  "description": "Sometimes we're surprised by what people don't know. We were talking with someone recently about Sarah Silverman and JAPs and they thought we meant she was Japanese.\n\nUm, no.\n\nSo for those of you who are clearly not up on the lingo (and apparently haven't been since 1964 or so), JAP stands for Jewish American Princess. You know, Daddy's little girl? Real diamond earrings at age 7? Had a bat mitzvah more lavish than the coronation of an Arabian prince? Probably married to a nebbish little fellow who cowers when she does so much as glance at him? Are we ringing any bells here?\n\nWell, if you still don't know then we give up. Go watch Sarah's show (or for that matter, Spaceballs) and consider yourself lucky.\n\nNow whether Sarah is someone who knows what a JAP is and is just making fun or actually is one is another question. And unfortunately, the answer requires the kind of intimate celebrity knowledge that simply doesn't happen in our line of work. \n\nBut here's hoping it's the former.",
