  "description": "We'll start with the name. Covetous, which — for those of you who fell asleep during services — means greedy. Then there's Shen, which is not at all Jewish, but is a disturbingly close cousin to Shem, name of Noah's son and root for the term Semite. As in Jew.\n\nThen there's his profession: jeweler. If there's a more Jewish job than lawyer or doctor or dentist or accountant or actor or comedian or textile factory owner or money lender then it's jeweler. \n\nThen there's the character himself. Greedy Semite is a funny little fellow who you find hiding in a barrel during Act II of Diablo III making him Coward I in Blizzard video game franchise IV. \n\nHe has a strange accent, tells you to wear a sweater in the cold, wears that weird leather skullcap everywhere, loves food (especially cured, salted meats), and has that strange, so-silly-he's-secretly-smart thing that seems endemic to so many stars of Semitic folk stories. \n\nSo ummmmm, yeah. Can you see where we're going with this one?",
