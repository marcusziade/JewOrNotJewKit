Take in the ancient art of Chinese magic!\n\nWait... wasn't it Japanese?\n\n\nNo, no, definitely Chinese. Where were we? Yes, Okito, the mysterious and amazing! Okito, whose power knows no bounds! Okito...\n\nOkito, a rather famous magician a century ago, was neither Japanese nor Chinese. Yes, his name was an anagram of Tokio, the old spelling of Tokyo, and yes, he practiced \"Chinese-styled\" magic, and yes, he tried to pass himself off as Asian... but in reality, he was Tobias Bamberg, a fifth generation illusionist, and a Jew. This would be him.\n\nOkito's son David was a magician as well, performing under the name of Fu Manchu. Yes, Fu Manchu.\n\nHow is that better than \"Bamberg\"?\n\n\nfunction loadPic() {\n swapPic('o/okito', 'tobias_bamberg');\n}",
