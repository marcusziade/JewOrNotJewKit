  "description": "The \"Borderline Jew\" verdict has been bothering us lately. Introduced early on this website, it has been used in cases where we want to say, \"Jew, but...\" It's usually used for people with one Jewish parent who don't exactly identify as Jewish. Which is all fine and good, but...\n\nTake a look a Hollywood heartthrob Tab Hunter, who had a very active career in the 1950s and 60s. Hunter was born with the name Arthur Kelm to a Jewish father and a goyishe mother. Soon, his father was out of the picture, and the mother raised young Arthur Catholic.\n\nWhen he was in Hollywood, the studios tried to hide the now-renamed Tab Hunter's homosexuality, pushing fake romances with Natalie Wood and Debbie Reynolds. In reality, Hunter partnered and later married producer Allan Glaser, Jew. But despite having a Jewish father and a Jewish spouse, Hunter never identified as Jewish. So, Borderline Jew, right?\n\nAnd yet, here we go again, wrestling with the verdict, debating ethnicity versus religion... We guess that's why we came up with the \"Borderline Jew\" verdict in the first place! Why be bothered by it?",
