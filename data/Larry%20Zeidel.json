  "description": "In 1967, the National Hockey League doubled in size from six to 12. That meant numerous job openings at the game's highest level.\n\nOne of the new teams, the Philadelphia Flyers, decided to sign defenseman Larry Zeidel. Zeidel played in the NHL before... 13 years prior. The Flyers signed a 39-year-year-old.\n\nAnd how did they end up signing Zeidel? He made an illustrated brochure and sent it to the new teams. The Flyers bit. Perhaps Zeidel left his age off the brochure.\n\nWhile with the Flyers, Zeidel renewed his rivalry with notorious douchebag Eddie Shack. The two brawled while they were in the minors, famously taking the fight into the stands. In the NHL, the two engaged in a massive stick-swinging altercation.\n\nWhy was Zeidel so pissed off? Allegedly, because Shack used antisemitic slurs.\n\nWe might have just found our all-time favorite Philadelphia athlete.",
