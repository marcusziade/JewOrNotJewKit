  "description": "There are quite a few things we don't understand about the goyim.\n\nGood Friday. Haggis. The Macarena.\n\nAnd the inability to come up with names for their children.\n\nWe're not talking about the recent trend of sticking a \"y\" everywhere: \"Jordan\" becoming \"Jordyn\", \"Brandon\" becoming \"Brandyn\". Sure, there's nothing creative about vowel swapping, but that's a discussion for another time. Here, we're talking about the tradition of naming children after yourself.\n\nNo, we Jews got it right. No Moishe Juniors or Schlomo Juniors here. And that's probably for the best.\n\nSo we can't go above \"Borderline Jew\" for Robert Downey Junior. He is 3/8th Jewish, but that was not enough to stop his father from slapping his son with the unimaginative moniker.\n\nDowney does call himself a \"Jewish-Buddhist\", but says he's also dabbed in Christianity and Krishnaism. And his own son is named \"Indio\". Yep, \"Borderline Jew\" it is.",
