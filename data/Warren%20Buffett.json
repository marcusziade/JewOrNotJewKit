  "description": "Some people think Warren Buffett is Jewish. Why would that be?\n\nHe contributes to some Jewish charities, but you don't have to be Jewish to do that.\n\nHe was born and lives in Nebraska, not many Jews there.\n\nHe considers himself an agnostic, so religiously he's not Jewish.\n\nHe's invested in Israel, but that doesn't make him a Jew, just a good businessman.\n\nHis mother's maiden name is Stahl, which might mean he has some Jewish ancestors... or might not.\n\nHis former son-in-law is a Jew... Well, that's just a reach.\n\nIs it because he's the second (wait, what day of the week is it?) richest man in the world?\n\nWell, we guess there are worse reasons than that...",
