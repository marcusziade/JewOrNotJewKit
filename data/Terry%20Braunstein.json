  "description": "Since curling was re-introduced in the 1998 Winter Olympics, Canada's men and women have never failed to medal, collecting a total of five golds, three silvers, and two bronzes. Until this year, that is, when both did not get on the podium, causing a national state of mourning. (It's Canada. They love their curling.)\n\nBut 2018 was not the first time Canada failed in curling. Let's take a trip back to 1965, for the 7th annual World Curling Championship in lovely (we assume) Perth, Scotland.\n\nCanada came into the tournament as six-time defending champions (out of six tournaments, for those who can't do the math). They were skippered by Terry Braunstein, who won the Canadian championship that year. Clearly, he was going to lead his country to another glory. Until he didn't.\n\nCanada lost to the US in the round-robin, and then again in the title game. Braunstein went from being a national hero to a footnote. He never appeared at the world championship again. Still, all things considering, he is probably the greatest Jewish curler ever, for all that's worth.\n\nHonestly, it's not worth that much... unless you're from Canada?",
