  "description": "\"He was a nice guy (but) I'm a Christian and he's an atheist. Some days I felt sorry for him.\" â€” Toni Braxton\n\nThe man Toni was talking about was Alec Mazo, her partner on \"Dancing with the Stars\". We're not sure if that was the year Steve Guttenberg was involved.\n\nSo, no, the two didn't do too well. Hard to do so when you feel such contempt for your partner. Maybe they should have tried to bond over their shared Jewish heritage...\n\nIf only.\n\nMazo is a Russian Jew. Toni, the super-Christian Braxton, claims to be a quarter Jewish, through her grandmother. Too bad that there is absolutely no truth to that; both sets of her grandparents came from minister families.\n\nWe feel sorry for you, too, Toni.",
