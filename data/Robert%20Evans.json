  "description": "In the 1970s, Robert Evans, once Robert Shapera, once a women's clothing salesman, once a part-time actor, became a notorious playboy, and one of Hollywood's most powerful producers. His credits included \"The Godfather\" and \"Chinatown\". In the 1990s, there was even a movie made about his career (you don't see that often with producers!), which, in the 2000s, was adapted into a short-lived surrealistic cartoon show on Comedy Central (you don't see that often with anyone...).\n\nWe skipped the 1980s, when Evans was convicted of cocaine trafficking. He claimed that he was only a user, not a seller, and was afraid that he will be known as \"Bob 'Cocaine' Evans to my grave\". Well, since he just passed, let's check out if he was right...\n\nLA Times: \"Robert Evans, producer of 'Chinatown' who saved Paramount Pictures, dies at 89.\" Drugs mentioned in the fourth paragraph.\n\nWashington Post: \"Robert Evans, Hollywood mogul of legendary bravado, dies at 89.\" Cocaine mentioned in the third paragraph.\n\nNY Times: \"Robert Evans, a maverick producer of Hollywood classics, dies at 89.\" Cocaine mentioned in the first paragraph.\n\nSo we guess Evans was spot on.\n\nYou know what neither of these obits mention? That he was Jewish...",
