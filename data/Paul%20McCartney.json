  "description": "Who are the McJews?\n\nNo, they're not the new kosher sandwich from McDonald's: they are the rarest of the rare. They are the Jews with a \"Mc\" in front of their last names. Good luck finding one. Lord knows we've tried, and all we've found is a leprechaun, a unicorn, and some crappy school for wizards in North Scotland. What a damned waste.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat makes us think Paul McCartney might be Jewish? It's not because he was  secretly born Pincus Martz or anything random like that. It's that he raised his children Jewish. So is the Walrus, the Jew? Not so much. \n\nIt's his first wife, Linda Eastman, who became a McJew when she married Paul. And that's who raised the children — Heather, Mary, Stella, and James — to live and let daven.\n\nAs for Paul himself, alas, he didn't convert. But when it came time for a new wife? Nancy Shevell, another Jew (we will conveniently glance over that gold-digger, Heather Mills).\n\nSo what about O'Jews? Yeah, still looking for that one. But if someone needs a spare leprechaun, you let us know, K?",
