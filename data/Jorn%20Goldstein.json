  "description": "A Jewish Norwegian Olympic hockey goaltender? Well, certainly!\n\nNorway, for whatever reason, is not as good at hockey as its Scandinavian brethren Sweden and Finland. It has qualified for the Olympics on numerous occasions, but never came close to medaling. Such was the case in 1984, when they failed to win a game.\n\nThe goaltender for Norway was Jorn Goldstein, who, if he went by his middle name instead — Irving Goldstein — would not feel out of place at anyone's seder. His father was a Holocaust survivor, his mother emigrated to Norway in the early 20th century. So, a bonafide Jew.\n\nEven though Norway failed to win a game, Goldstein played well in its only draw, a 3:3 result against the defending champions, USA. The less said about the other games, the better. (10:4 loss to the Czechs, 8:1 to Canada, 16:2 to Finland...)\n\nStill, a Jewish Norwegian Olympic hockey goaltender!",
