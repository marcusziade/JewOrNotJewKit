  "description": "In 1926, New York's Jewish hockey fans were in for a treat. Starting in goal for the New York Rangers was a fellow landsman, Lorne Chabotsky!\n\nSomething was pretty weird, however. There was another player on the team: Lorne Chabot. Strangely, Chabotsky only played in home games; Chabot, on the road.\n\nThe answer was obvious, yet incredibly ridiculous: Chabotsky was Chabot. So why the two names?\n\nApparently, the fledgling Rangers wanted to get more Jewish fans over the already established New York Americans. So Lorne Chabot became Lorne Chabotsky... in home games only. On the road, those savvy Canadians would recognize one of their own, so his real name was used.\n\nDid the rouse work? Well, Chabot only played two seasons for the Rangers, but the club still exists all these years later. The Americans bit the dust in 1942...\n\nfunction flip(b) {\n  if (b) {\n    memorize();\n    setTitleOnly('Lorne Chabotsky');\n    setRatings(0, 4, 3);\n  } else {\n    remember();\n  }\n}\nflip(true);",
