  "description": "So, Pink is Halachically Jewish. It's not that obvious, sure, but after 400 profiles, it's not that surprising either.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is Pink coming to the defense of Mel Gibson. \"Alcohol makes you do crazy things,\" Pink said. \"I'm a fan of his work.\"\n\nReally, Pink? Really? A fan of his work? What work would that be? Sure, \"Lethal Weapon\" was pretty cool, but that was 20 years ago, and he played a lunatic, not much of a stretch. What has he done since then? \"Braveheart\"? Overrated. \"The Patriot\"? Lame. \"Signs\"? Preachy. \"What Women Want\"? Well, we didn't see that one, but come on. \"What Women Want\". Starring Mel Gibson. How could that be watchable?\n\nWhatever it is, just don't tell us it's \"The Passion of the Christ\" that Pink is a fan of. If that's the case, then her verdict will be switched to \"Sadly, a Jew\" immediately... At least until we get the power to excommunicate.",
