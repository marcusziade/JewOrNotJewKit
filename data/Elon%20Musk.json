  "description": "Every inventor, for all of their genius, also has really dumb ideas. It seems that's how Hashem chooses to balance us â€” in order to reach the greatest heights, we must also hit the deepest depths.\n\nFor instance, Ben Franklin, founding father and inventor also believed that the turkey would make a better national symbol than the eagle. \n\nThomas Edison believed alternating current was a literal dead end (and electrocuted an elephant to prove it) and also invented ghostbusting equipment. (Who ya gonna call, Thomas Edison! Just doesn't have the same ring...)\n\nEven Einstein, the great and powerful, went to his grave denying quantum physics, despite that it was all proven fact well before he passed.\n\nSo, Elon Musk. He's not Jewish, despite a somewhat Jew-y name. He's considered to be a modern inventor dude. What errors will we all remember him for?\n\nPayPal? Hahahahahahahahahahaha. No.\n\nSpaceX? OK, so it sounds like something Wolverine uses, but at this point he could have called it the USS Eff U and it would hardly matter. Musk has the exclusive NASA contract and his Dragon (OK, that sounds bad out of context) was the first commercial vehicle to dock at the International Space Station.\n\nTesla? A $57,000 electric car named for an inventor of some dubious designs himself (including a death ray and a pocket earthquake machine)? Ahem.\n\nWell, we'll see how it all turns out in a few decades. After all, Musk may yet nominate the platypus to represent the United Floating States after his dumb electric car idea fails to save the planet.\n\n(Editor's update, 2023: BARF)",
