  "description": "You remember Janeane Garofalo, right? Ben Stiller, Larry Sanders, \"Reality Bites\", a miserable year on SNL, \"Copland\", \"Wet Hot American Summer\", a period where she was in a bunch of movies every year. They even tried to make Janeane into a Cyrano-de-Bergerac-type opposite Uma Thurman. Anyway, Janeane Garofolo: funny. Not a Jew.\n\nNot a Jew, but... married to one? This is where it gets strange: back in 1991, Janeane married Robert Cohen, a writer on the Ben Stiller Show, in Vegas. The two thought it was a joke, but that joke ended when Cohen tried to marry someone else and was denied. Nevertheless, the two were \"together\" for two decades, even though they were never really TOGETHER. Be careful when you go to Vegas, kids!\n\nWhere were we? Yes, Janeane's career. Somehow, since the early 2000s, the roles dried up. What happened, Hollywood? You have a dearth of funny goyishe women! We miss you, Janeane!",
