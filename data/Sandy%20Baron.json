  "description": "Do you remember the classic Seinfeld episode \"The Pen\", when Jerry and Elaine go to Florida to visit Jerry's parents? It's one of the few episodes to take place entirely outside of New York, and the only one without both George and Kramer. (Jason Alexander famously threatened to quit if he was excluded again.)\n\nIn any case, the famous pen that gives the episode its title is the source of much friction between Jerry and his father's frenemy Jack Klompus. (Take the pen, Jerry!) Klompus, a resident of the Del Boca Vista retirement community, is played by long-time Borscht Belt comedian Sandy Baron. How old do you think Baron is in this episode? Must be in his 70s, right?\n\nNope. Baron is 55 years old. Yes, 55! He was born in 1936, and the episode aired in 1991. (He might have been 54 at the time of filming?) Jack Klompus, with his overbite, his spotted face, his hunch, his leathery skin, his raspy voice, is 55 years old! (Take the pen, Jerry! Take the pen!)\n\nWhat's our point? Actors don't have to play characters that match them in age! That's just makeup, the real-life Baron was simply much younger than Klompus!\n\nNo point. Just the ever-lingering stench of pending death. That is all.",
