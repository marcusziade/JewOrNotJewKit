  "description": "Hey goyim!\n\nWe're gonna let you in on a little secret. We don't hate Jesus Christ as much as you think we do.\n\nIt's not like the two millennia of Christian-led antisemitism are his fault. He lived, he tried, he died. It's his followers who fucked things up.\n\nYou know who we REALLY hate? One of those followers, Saul of Tarsus, known to you as Saint Paul. The world's first antisemite.\n\nSo what did Paul do? Well, he basically started antisemitism as we know it today: the organized hatred of Judaism as a religion and Jews as people. We'll let famed philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (definitely not a Jew) speak: \"[Paul was] the genius in hatred, in the standpoint of hatred, and in the relentless logic of hatred.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: Paul wasn't just the world's first antisemite. He also might have been the world's first Jew for Jesus. For not only was he born a Jew, some scholars believe that he never left the religion, and just changed sects (makes sense, because at the time, Christianity was just a sect of Judaism).\n\nThat being said, we really can't relent on the hate. The world's first antisemite, the world's first Jew for Jesus, the world's first self-loathing Jew, it's rather irrelevant. Rot in hell, Saint Paul.\n\nYes, you heard us right, goyim. Rot in hell, Saint Paul. Rot. In. Hell.",
