  "description": "As of this writing, Tara Strong has 594 acting credits. What have you seen her in?\n\nNothing. Absolutely nothing. Alright, that's technically not true; if you are a fan of the old Sabrina the Teenage Witch series, Tara appeared as Sabrina's BFF in a couple of made-for-TV movies. Wow, are we reaching here. No, you haven't seen Tara in anything.\n\nThe key word is SEEN.\n\nTara is one of the most sought-ought voice actresses in the business. Starting in the late 80s (under her more Jewy maiden name, Charendoff), and continuing to this day, she can be HEARD in... pretty much everything.\n\nHer credits include every corner of animation, from \"Rugrats\" to \"Samurai Jack\" to \"Rick and Morty\". There is a plethora of video games, with numerous titles in Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, and Batman series. If an animated work has been made in the past three decades, you can bet that Tara can be heard... if not in a main role, then as one of \"additional voices\".\n\nHer most famous part? Twilight Sparkle in \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\".\n\nNo, we have not SEEN or HEARD that one. Swear to G-d!",
