  "description": "When one thinks of Fleetwood Mac, the first names that comes to mind are Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, right? Well, did you know that they were not even original members? Stevie and Lindsey didn't join the band until 1975, eight years after its creation.\n\nYou know who was there from the start? Peter Green. Often listed as one of the best guitar players of all time, the man born as Peter Greenbaum was not only the founding member; he was the band's frontman.\n\nWhy isn't Green that well known? In 1970, he had to be replaced because of constant drug use. (Which begs the question, how much drug use does there have to be for someone to be kicked out of a rock band? In the 1970s?)\n\nGreen went on to have a successful career, but should clearly not be forgotten when one thinks of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThe other acceptable answer to the opening question is Mick Fleetwood, obviously.",
