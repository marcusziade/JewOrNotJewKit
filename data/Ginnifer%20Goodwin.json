  "description": "So, the wife got us into \"Big Love\" on HBO. Polygamy is so fascinatingly horrifying.\n\nOf course, as Jews we have polygamy in our blood. Even in Hebrew school, we were told the story of Laban pushing ugly Leah onto Jacob instead of the lovely Rachel... and no one baited an eyelash. Two wives? Big deal.\n\nWell, watching the show, it is a big deal. Multiple wives? Sometimes we wonder how we handle one. (Sorry, honey. We kid because we love.)\n\nSo, back to \"Big Love\". The show centers around a Mormon family, a seemingly normal family, except for the fact that the husband, played by Bill Paxton, has three wives: the eldest, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, the bitchy, played by Chloe Sevigny, and the youngest, played by Ginnifer Goodwin. The Jewish Ginnifer Goodwin, that is. And played very convincingly, we might add.\n\nWe guess it's in her blood as well.",
