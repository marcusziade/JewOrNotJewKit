  "description": "If you watch \"Veep\", the political affiliation of the title character is left ambiguous. Selina Meyer, the bumbling, clueless vice president, as played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, could be a Republican. She could be a Democrat. It's purposely not clear.\n\nBut we're not RepublicanOrNotRepublican.com (Arlen Specter FTW!). We're JewOrNotJew.com, so you know where this is heading...\n\nIf you watch \"Veep\", the ethnicity and religious affiliation of the title character is left ambiguous. In fact, her name was specifically selected to be neutral and raise such questions. And, as we know, \"Meyer\" is one of those names that straddle the line between goy and Jew...\n\nHmmmm. Can't go with Jew here. First of all, Meyer is her married name, and most importantly (spoiler alert!), Selina ends season 3 not as VP, but as the president...\n\nIn no world, fictional or not, comedic or otherwise, can we have a Jewish president. There is nothing ambiguous about that.",
