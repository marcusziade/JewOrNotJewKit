  "description": "Every few years, Hollywood decides to read subtitles. Specifically, they give an Oscar nomination for someone acting in a foreign film. Roberto Benigni and Marion Cotillard are famous examples. (They actually won; the majority, including today's subject Isabelle Huppert, did not.)\n\nWhy do they do that? Why does Hollywood single out one specific performance over thousands... in a language a vast majority of the selection committee doesn't understand? Doesn't reading subtitles take away from paying attention to the actual acting? Besides, who wants to read those darn subtitles...\n\nSo, yes, this is a very roundabout way to get to Isabelle Huppert, who is one of the leading ladies of French cinema, and finally got recognition on this side of the pond by snagging an Oscar nom last year. Even though she was raised Catholic, Isabelle's father was Jewish.\n\nSo why did it take so long to profile such an important Jewish actress? We don't like reading subtitles either...",
