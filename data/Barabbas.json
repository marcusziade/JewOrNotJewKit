We gotta pardon a prisoner, and the Jews get to pick.\n\nQuintus: And we just captured Barabbas.\n\nPilate: That rabble-rouser! Just hearing his name gets my blood boiling!\n\nQuintus: He speaks of starting a revolution!\n\nPilate: I know! Can you imagine? Jews taking over?\n\nQuintus: They'll kick us back to Rome!\n\nPilate: I don't want to go back to Rome! I'll be a nobody in Rome!\n\nQuintus: Well, we got that other prisoner...\n\nPilate: Joshua something or other...\n\nQuintus: He is harmless.\n\nPilate: Harmless?\n\nQuintus: Yeah, just wanders around in a robe and talks a bunch of gibberish.\n\nPilate: So why did we imprison him?\n\nQuintus: He was spewing some nonsense. Turning water into beer, I think?\n\nPilate: He doesn't really?...\n\nQunitus: Of course not! It's some kind of a magic trick!\n\nPilate: We can't have that! \n\nQuintus: Obviously, we can't, but think about it: Barabbas talks about starting a revolution. Joshua tries to get people drunk.\n\nPilate: So how do we get the Jews to pick Joshua?\n\nQuintus: We pay them off!\n\nPilate: Of course! You know how those people love their shekels!\n\nQuintus: Yes, we pay them off, we pardon Joshua, and that rebel Barabbas hangs!\n\nPilate: Maybe we crucify him?\n\nQuintus: What a great idea! What can go wrong?",
