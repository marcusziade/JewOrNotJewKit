  "description": "Every now and then, we dig into the depths of our mailbox and find out who the most requested profile is. Usually it's some Hollywood starlet...\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu? You don't say! In what world does anyone wonder if the Prime Minister of Israel is Jewish?\n\nAnd yet, the requests keep on coming. So we're going to turn this profile over to you, our readers. Here are SOME of the reasons you want us to profile Netanyahu (everything sic):\n\n \"He has been Israel's prime minister, of course he must be checked!!\"\n \"Since you have people like Ben gurion and golda Meir in here, I think benji has earned this place.\"\n \"Fairly obvious.\"\n \"A most charismatic figure on the world stage. One of the most dangerous men on earth.\"\n \"What do you think of Israel's current PM?\"\n \"Only the most important Jew on earth today.\"\n \"Because he's Netanyahu of course.\"\n \"I was unable to find him listed on the site, which I thought was rather unusual given his position.\"\n \"If somebody started some rumour that he's not jewish it could really harm the economy.\"\n \"How do you guys *NOT* have Benjamin Netanyahu on here?\"\n \"He is by far the most important Jew in the world.\"\n \"We want to know how Jewish he is. And how Zionist you are.\"\n \"Covering him now would be topical and get a lot of 'hits'.\"\n\nWell then.",
