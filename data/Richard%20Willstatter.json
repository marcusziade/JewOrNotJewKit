  "description": "10 years ago, we profiled Fritz Haber, who won the Nobel in Chemistry. He has a surprisingly low Jew Score for a Nobel laureate, but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nHaber had a friend, Richard Willstatter, a renowned chemist in his own right. In fact, Willstatter's Nobel in 1915 preceded Haber's by three years; his came for research on chlorophyll.\n\nThat same year, Haber asked his pal to help out on a new project. Willstatter refused. Haber went forth without his friend, and was ultimately successful. That project? Poison gasses. Haber is known today as \"father of chemical warfare\" for his (ahem) contributions to World War I. That low Jew Score should become clear.\n\nInstead, Willstatter worked on a filter to protect from these same gasses. His work helped save numerous lives from his friend's invention.\n\nIn 1924, Willstatter quit science altogether as a protest to rising antisemitism in Germany.\n\nSo, yeah, this should be an unsurprisingly high Jew Score.",
