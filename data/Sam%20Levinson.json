  "description": "Did you know that \"Homeland\" and \"Euphoria\" have a lot in common? Sure, they seem completely different on the surface: one is a prestige drama about a young woman with an addiction problem... and the other is, well, a prestige drama about a young woman with an addiction problem. Sure, one takes place in the high stakes of international politics, and the other in the high stakes of high school, but no one said they are exactly alike!\n\nBut there is something else: both are based on Israeli shows. A decade ago, \"Homeland\" became Israel's most famous television export (the original is called \"Prisoners of War\"). Now, \"Euphoria\" surely has taken the claim (the original is called, well, \"Euphoria\").\n\nBoth were created by Jews: \"Homeland\" by Gideon Raff, who was actually in charge of the Israeli original as well; \"Euphoria\" by Sam Levinson (son of Barry!... and one-time boyfriend of Ellen Barkin, thirty years his senior), who somehow finds the time to write every single episode and direct pretty much all of them.\n\nOh! Both feature an Emmy-winning performance for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama! Are we sure they are not the same show?",
