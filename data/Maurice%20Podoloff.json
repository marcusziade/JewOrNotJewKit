  "description": "The NBA recently announced a new award which will be given to the team with the best regular-season record. It's similar to the mostly-ignored Presidents Trophy in the NHL and the mostly-beloved Supporters Shield in MLS. Called the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, it's named after the league's first ever president.\n\nPodoloff, an Ukrainian-born Jew, was in charge of the NBA from its humble beginnings (as the BAA) in 1946 to 1963. He oversaw expansion, the introduction of the shot clock and the college draft, and is largely credited with helping the league survive its nascent years.\n\nWait a second... Doesn't the NBA already have an award named after Podoloff? It definitely does! The Maurice Podoloff Trophy is annually given to the league's MVP! What gives? Will there now be TWO Podoloff Trophies?\n\nOf course not. In fact, a week later, the MVP trophy was renamed after the very obvious Michael Jordan. Oh well. At least Podoloff will continue to be remembered...",
