  "description": "The Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, famously lost four straight Super Bowls in the early 1990s. But did you know that there is another NFL franchise that can possibly beat the Bills' feat of competent futility?\n\nThe New York Giants lost five out of six NFL championship games between 1958 and 1963. Note we didn't say \"Super Bowls\".\n\nThis is because the first Super Bowl was played in 1967, only it wasn't called the \"Super Bowl\" back then... you know, we're getting deep into the weeds here. The point is, the NFL mostly ignores its pre-Super Bowl era when counting titles and championship games. (If they didn't, you would see the Detroit Lions and the Cleveland Browns as multiple-time winners!)\n\nBut we're talking about the losers here, and the poor New York Giants.  The first of those losses, to Baltimore, has been called \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\". The last three, twice to Green Bay and once to Chicago, were coached by Allie Sherman.\n\nSherman was the first ever to win two consecutive NFL Coach of the Year awards, in 1961 and 1962. He designed innovative offenses and was a Jew...\n\nJust like Marv Levy.",
