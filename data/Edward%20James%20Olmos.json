  "description": "Here's a tip for all of you, readers:\n\nDon't talk to strange old men in stores.\n\nObvious, you say? Not so to Edward James Olmos.\n\nThe Mexican-American actor was out shopping when he was recognized by an old man. Your name is not really Olmos, the old man said. It's Olmosh. You are a Hungarian Jew.\n\nHogwash, should have been Olmos' response. Should have, but wasn't. Olmos bought it, for years telling people he is part Jewish.\n\nHogwash, because Olmos is a fairly common Spanish last name. Olmosh? There are some Olmoshes in this world. Whether any of the are related to Edward James is anyone's guess. Whether any of them are Jewish is another.\n\nApologies for the lateness of the tip, Edward James Olmos.",
