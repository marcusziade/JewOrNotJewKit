  "description": "We're finally profiling Michael Lerner! No, not the one we just profiled. No, not the other one we just profiled. This one is Oscar-nominated actor Michael Lerner, best known for \"Barton Fink\". Finally!\n\nSo, yes, \"Barton Fink\", an early entry in the Coen Brothers oeuvre, starring John Turturro (It's a Coen Brothers movie. Odds are that Turturo is in it.) as a Jewish playwright trying to make it in Hollywood. Lerner plays studio head Jack Lipnick, also Jewish, modeled after previously-profiled Louis B. Mayer. It was the most famous role of Lerner's long career that spanned close to 200 credits.\n\nWhat else can we say about this Michael Lerner? Well, he was missing a top of an index finger. He sliced it off when cutting a tongue sandwich while working in a New York deli... So, obviously Jewish.\n\nJust like the other two Michael Lerners!",
