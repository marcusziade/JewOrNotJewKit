  "description": "\"June Foray is not the female Mel Blanc. Mel Blanc was the male June Foray.\" â€” Chuck Jones\n\nWe're not going to argue with animation giant Jones, but he makes a point here. While the beloved Blanc voiced many of Jones' famed  characters, Foray's contribution to voice acting was not far behind. In the world of Looney Tunes, she spent 60(!) years voicing the Granny of Sylvester and Tweety fame. (Honestly, not our favorite character. Bet you don't know her real name: Emma Webster. Clearly, not a Jew. Anyway...)\n\nJust like Blanc, Foray's contributions extended beyond the world of Looney Tunes. One of the most prolific voice actors ever, her best-known work was Rocky the Flying Squirrel, whom she voiced for 58(!) years.\n\nForay was not just a voice actress: she was on the elite list of celebrities that had the honor of being included on Richard Nixon's master enemy list. Her transgression? Organizing a boycott to protest price freezes instituted by Nixon.\n\nNixon's enemy list... That's one area where Foray one-upped Blanc!",
