  "description": "Who is the greatest Jewish hockey player of all time?\n\nOh boy. You stumped us there, anonymous questioner.\n\nHmmmm. We'll probably have to go with Mathieu Schneider, who has played over 20 years in the NHL, won the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens and the Hockey World Cup with Team USA.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, there's now a new answer to this question.\n\nFor Mike Cammalleri is entering his seventh NHL season, where he will be playing for the Canadiens are making the switch from the Calgary Flames. Last season, he scored 82 points, good for 13th in the league. (Yes, 13th is not exactly 3rd. But we'll take what we can get.) Cammalleri has also played for Canada, helping them to the World Championship in 2007.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nOf course, as his Italian last name suggests, he is only half Jewish ethically, through his mother. But... this is Jewish hockey players we're talking about. We repeat: we'll take what we can get.",
