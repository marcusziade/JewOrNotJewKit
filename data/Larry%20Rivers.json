  "description": "Pictured below is a famous work of art, owned by the incredibly prestigious Museum of Modern Art, MoMA. Can you guess its name?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you said (reveal answer), we are speechless. We really are. What are you doing on this website? You belong in places more refined that our little adobe.\n\nAnyway, if you didn't get it right (and we're willing to bet you didn't get it right), you're probably thinking, what the hell? That's not what that painting looks like! Where's Delaware? Where's freakin' Washington?\n\nWell, he is right there, in the middle, wearing white pants... we think. It's actually not clear, because the artist himself, Larry Rivers (real name: Yitzak Grossberg), claimed that the painting had nothing to do with Delaware or Washington. It's an Americanized version of \"War and Peace\". Why the name? Are you going to argue with the man called the \"Godfather of Pop Art\"?!\n\nSo here is another painting by Rivers, this one in the Whitney Museum of American Art. Dare do guess its name?\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, (reveal answer)!\n\nfunction reveal(q) {\n  s = document.getElementById(q);\n  s.innerHTML = '\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\"';\n}",
