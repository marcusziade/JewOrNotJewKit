  "description": "We've been watching the \"Wet Hot American Summer\" prequel on Netflix (in case you couldn't tell from the recently-published Michael Showalter profile), when a new actress entered the fray. That must be... Amanda Peet, we thought.\n\nWrong! It was Lake Bell.\n\nBell, who played the VERY Jewish Donna in the WHAS prequel and sequel, is probably best known for creating, directing, and acting in \"In a World...\", a movie about a voiceover artist. She's also had numerous TV and movie roles... or was that Peet?\n\nTurns out that we are not the only ones to confuse the two. According to Bell, it always happens. She's learned to live with it.\n\nIn any case, Bell is Jewish, just like Peet, who we've already profiled...\n\nAre we sure we've profiled Peet and not Bell?",
