  "description": "As we previously discussed in the Mel Torme profile, Jews pretty much wrote the American Christmas songbook. Well, it's time for the goyim to give back.\n\nSo what gentile is out there writing Hanukkah songs? What legendary goyishe musician is lending his talents to the Jews?\n\nWould you believe... Utah senator Orrin Hatch?\n\nThe song is called \"Eight Days of Hanukkah\" and is set, according to the New York Times, to \"a bouncy synthesizer beat\". And gosh darn it, Hatch, a Mormon, can't help but express his love for Jews. He has mezuzahs in his homes and proudly wears a mezuzah necklace. \"Anything I can do for the Jewish people, I will do,\" he says. \"I feel sorry I'm not Jewish sometimes,\" he adds. We'll decline to comment there.\n\nSo how does the song go? Well, its refrain says it all:\n\nEight days of Hanukkah,\nCome let's celebrate.\nEight days of Hanukkah,\nLet's celebrate tonight, Hey!\n\nHatch calls his creation \"a gift to the Jewish people\". Is it too late to return it?",
