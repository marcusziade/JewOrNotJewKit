  "description": "Resistance doesn't come easy.\n\nStatus quo is, by definition, stability. Why disturb it?\n\nEven when things are bad, they can get worse. Why tempt fate?\n\nThe most difficult resistance is one with no chance for success. When one knows they will fail, but one still fights.\n\nOne fights, because the status quo is no longer palatable. Because stability is just an illusion. Because one has to stand up for their people.\n\nBecause fascism should never be tolerated.\n\nIn 1943, the Jews of Warsaw's ghetto resisted. For a month, they fought off the Nazis with little-to-no hope of victory. At the end, 20,000 Jews were dead, and another 36,000 were deported to concentration camps. Among the dead was Mordechai Anielewicz, who, as the head of the Jewish Fighting Organization, led the uprising. He was just 24 years old.\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto Uprising will forever be remembered as a testament to bravery of the Jewish people.\n\nResistance can't be easy.",
