  "description": "Just about everyone who knows literature, even only slightly, is familiar with the great Yiddish writer (and owner of a perfect Jew Score!), Isaac Bashevis Singer.\n\nAnd certainly, Jews have been associated with textiles in the past. Before the stereotypical Jewish lawyer or doctor (but after the stereotypical Jewish money lender), Jews were best known for running and owning textile factories on the Lower East Side — overseeing the production of mass amounts of sewn cloth for the, ummm, masses. Of course that also means they were also known for inhumane work hours, child labor, parsimonious pay, and below-standard fire precautions. But it was a different time. Or something.\n\nIn any case, therefore, one could easily look at Isaac Singer — inventor of the sewing machine — and say, a ha! easy Jew.\n\nBut then you knew where this was going, didn't you?",
