  "description": "What's the Jewiest fruit? We know we've profiled tomatoes, but it's definitely not tomatoes.\n\nThere are \"seven species\" mentioned in the Torah that include five fruits indigenous to Israel, so let's go through them. (The non-fruits are wheat and barley, thanks for asking.)\n\n1. Grapes. Yeah, that's a big one. Grape juice for kids, Manischewitz for adults.\n\n2. Olives. Like tomatoes, officially a fruit, but... come on. Not a very fruity fruit.\n\n3. Pomegranates. Really, really overrated. The inverse of a fruit... you eat the seeds!\n\n4. Figs. What's the difference between figs and...\n\n5. Dates. Seriously, we don't know.\n\nNot listed: Peaches. Not native to Israel. Real name: Merrill Nisker, elctroclash musician from Canada. Jewish, however.\n\nAlso not listed: Oranges. The Jaffa variety specifically is native to Israel, and just might be the country's most famous export.\n\nThe answer is dates. Or is it figs?",
