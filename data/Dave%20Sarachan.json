  "description": "Ten years after graduating high school, we ran into two of our teachers in a local pizzeria. Now, these were not your run-of-the-mill teachers; we rather enjoyed their classes and thought that both played a part in shaping our education.\n\nSo, we walked over and greeted them. We were met with blank stares.\n\nTo these two teachers, we were just faces in the ever-changing crowd of students, sweeping by, class after class, year after year... So we (re-)introduced ourselves, got reluctant hellos, and quickly moved off to a slice of pepperoni.\n\nA few years after that, we ran into Dave Sarachan in a hotel lobby.\n\nNow, Sarachan is not exactly a household name, but he is one of the most successful American soccer coaches (and a Jew to boot!). He assisted Bruce Arena at the 2002 World Cup and then coached MLS's Chicago Fire during a solid five-year stint. And, yes, we do share a history, for Sarachan was once our gym teacher (not in high school).\n\nSo, we saw Sarachan, thought about it for a second, and then walked past. We knew not to repeat the same mistake.",
