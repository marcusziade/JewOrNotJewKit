  "description": "So, the election is today. You might have heard. But Americans are not just picking a president; a third of the Senate is up for grabs as well.\n\nCurrently, there are 13 Jews in the Senate. Only three are up for election: Carl Levin of Michigan, who should have no trouble dispatching his opponent, New Jersey's ancient Frank Lautenberg, expected to dismantle a fellow Jew, Dick Zimmer, and Norm Coleman of Minnesota, who is facing off against a political neophyte, comedian and talk show host.\n\nSo it should be a slam dunk for Coleman, right? Not so fast: his opponent is the erudite Al Franken. Early polls showed Coleman with the lead, late polls flipped over to Franken, and it's anyone guess who will be declared the winner.\n\nBut whatever happens, you can be assured of one thing: the number of Jews the Senate is not decreasing. And that's... okay.\n\n(Editor's update: it only took eight months, but Franken won.)",
