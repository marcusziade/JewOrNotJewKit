  "description": "Ed Jew is a San Francisco businessman. He started out managing a flower shop and running a taxi company cringeworthy named \"Howard Mock Jew\". He then went into real estate and entered politics, becoming a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nAnd this is when the shit hit the proverbial fan.\n\nIt's not just that Jew didn't live in the district that he claimed to represent... It's not just one of his properties was used as an illegal drug club... It's not just that he tried to shake down the owners of a rival tapioca shop for money (Yes, rival tapioca shop. He is known as \"Tapioca Ed\" for a reason)... It's not just that after he wasn't able to sell one of his properties, it mysteriously burned down... It's not just when the authorities got wind of all those things, he fled the country... It's all of the above. And more. Oh, there is more.\n\nSo how do we end this profile? It really should be \"Verdict: Not a Jew\", for the subject is definitely not Jewish. However, \"",
