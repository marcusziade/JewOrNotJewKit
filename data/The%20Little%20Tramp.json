  "description": "The little fellow wobbles down the sidewalk. Step by step.\n\nFour years ago today, we started this website. Our first posted profile? Charlie Chaplin.\n\nWho is that little fellow? What is his name? Who are his parents? Where is he from? What is his religion?\n\nChaplin wasn't Jewish, but many think that he was. So he seemed like the perfect start to our exploration of Jews... and Not Jews.\n\nAnd what will life bring to the little fellow? Will he start working in a factory? Will he pan for gold? Will he find true love? Will he become a dictator of a European nation?\n\nOf course, one of the main reasons people assume Chaplin is Jewish is because his character seems so Jewish himself. But little is known about The Tramp: Chaplin made his past purposely mysterious.\n\nHe doesn't say much, letting his face tell the story. Oh, little fellow, how you've made us laugh and cry with you!\n\nBut in at least one film, the masterpiece \"The Great Dictator\", The Tramp in fact Jewish.\n\nThe little fellow keeps wobbling. Step by step.\n\nAnd so do we. Nearly 900 profiles later. Step by step.",
