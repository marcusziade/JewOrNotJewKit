  "description": "We love \"The Count of Monte-Cristo\". No, that doesn't do it justice. We LOVE \"The Count of Monte-Cristo\". It might just be our favorite book.\n\nSo when we found out that English writer/comedian/actor Stephen Fry (he will be the Cheshire Cat in Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\") wrote a modern re-telling of the story, we were a tad cautious. After all, we're still pissed off at Hollywood for butchering the 2002 film version, the despicable dreck that somehow carried Dumas' name...\n\nStill, we picked up the book. Published in England as \"The Stars' Tennis Balls\" and re-titled for the American edition as \"Revenge\" (probably for the best â€” what is it with the British and their balls?), it's a clever, enjoyable read cover to cover that pays homage and gives justice to the original. Fry is definitely a talented writer. And let's not forget that he is Jewish...\n\nSo, a round of applause for him. On the book, at least. His anti-Israel stance, on the other hand... Well, that's a debate for another time.",
