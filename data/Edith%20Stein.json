  "description": "Catholics have a patron saint for everyone. There are patron saints for circus clowns and chimney sweeps, harpooners and heroin addicts, piano tuners and pharmaceutical sales reps... Everyone. There's even a patron saint for Jews.\n\nYes, you, Jews, have your own Catholic patron saint! Well, with one caveat.\n\nYou're gonna have to convert... The patron saint is one for converted Jews.\n\nSo who is the lucky guy who gets to watch over them? It's actually a gal. A rather unlucky gal.\n\nHer name was Edith Stein. Born to an observant Jewish family, she became an atheist â€” and then a Carmelite nun. In the early 1930s, Stein spoke out against the Nazis, writing to the pope about Jewish oppression in Germany... But when World War II came, that oppression got to her. The Nazis took Stein to Auschwitz, where it all ended.\n\nPope John Paul II sanctified Stein, making her Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. So now, she gets to watch over converted Jews from beyond the grave.\n\nAnd honestly, why not? G-d knows, converted Jews need all the help they can get...\n\nEven more so than circus clowns.",
