  "description": "No, Mark Burnett is not the most powerful man in the world.\n\nAs an executive producer he is responsible for such massive hits as Survivor, The Voice, and Shark Tank. So he's a pretty big macher in the entertainment world.\n\nHowever, Burnett's most important accomplishment has to be his creation of The Apprentice and thus the myth-making around our current Cheeto-in-Chief. When Burnett began working with Trump, his Orangeness was nothing more than a mobbed-up nepotisto with delusions of grandeur. One show later and well... We all know what's happened.\n\nThat makes Burnett kind of a kingmaker and, honestly, that's a lot more power than almost anyone else can claim. \n\nNo, Burnett isn't Jewish either, although he was married to a Jewish woman at one point. There was a time when — as big fans of the genre — we might have been disappointed by this, but nowadays we're happy to have him on the other team. \n\nThere's also a rumor that Burnett considered a Putin reality show at one point which... You know what? Here's hoping he moves on to another career before we lose the whole continent.",
