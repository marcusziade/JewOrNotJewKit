  "description": "When the New Jersey Devils took Jack Hughes first overall in the 2019 NHL Draft, he became the highest-drafted Jew ever (it's hard to top #1). The man who previously held that distinction? Quinn Hughes, who was taken seventh a year earlier by the Vancouver Canucks. The similarity in last names is not a coincidence: Quinn is Jack's brother.\n\nQuinn made his NHL debut late last season, and the reviews have been positive. And he is only 19, so the upside is huge.\n\nStrange, isn't it? Two of the best prospects in hockey are Jewish siblings. And there another one in the pipeline: brother Luke is already a member of US youth national teams and is expected to be drafted soon.\n\nA Jewish hockey dynasty? Check back in a couple of years!",
