  "description": "Jason Chaffetz really, really wants to be the Speaker of the House, but let's talk about a disturbing trend from his past.\n\nIn high school, Chaffetz stopped playing soccer, and started to play football. That worked out well, since he became a kicker on the BYU football team.\n\nIn college, Chaffetz dropped Judaism, and coverted to Mormonism. That worked out well, as it made him much more electable in Utah.\n\nAfter college, Chaffetz stopped being a Democrat, and became a Republican. That worked out well, as he made it all the way to the House, and now, look, he thinks he can be Speaker!\n\nSo it all worked out, but... we're not judging, but, you know...\n\nCome on! Judaism for Mormonism?!?!?! Come on!",
