  "description": "In three and a half years of running this website, we developed a loyal following. Readers who tune in weekly, if not daily; readers who get where we are coming from; readers who often send us wonderful suggestions that we turn into profiles.\n\nBut we also have a lot of casual readers. These readers might return once in a while, might send in a suggestion or two. We welcome them as well.\n\nAnd these casual readers seem to divide into two distinct groups. One wants us to profile every celebrity under the sun, whether they are Jewish or not. Say, Brad Pitt. Or Miley Cyrus. Maybe they want us to write something funny about them. Or maybe they think that we discovered a hint of Jewishness under the layers of goyishe armor. We don't know.\n\nThe other group wants us to profile every important Jew ever. Scientists, artists, writers, politicians, and did we mention scientists? These readers don't really want us to write something funny. They don't need for us to search for a hint of Jewishness â€” it's there. They want us to acknowledge these important Jews. For example, Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb.\n\nSo what do we do? How do we make everybody happy?\n\nSorry, dear readers, we can't. At the end, the only ones we can try to make happy is ourselves.\n\nAnd even that is not always easy.",
