  "description": "Tycho Brahe was one of the most brilliant men of all time... and also one of the stupidest. Let's deal with the brilliant part first.\n\nBrahe was a Danish astronomer whose work led to major breakthroughs in the science of the skies. All the way back in the 17th century, his astronomical calculations were so precise that they lay the groundwork for everyone who followed, including the probably-more-famous Johannes Kepler. Once Brahe's student, Kepler used his teacher's work to figure out the laws of planetary motion.\n\nBrahe also had no nose. (Perhaps he tried to compensate with the gigantic mustache?) He lost it in a duel with his cousin, over who was the better mathematician. You can't make this stuff up. But that's not even the stupidest part.\n\nFor that, we need to go all the way to Brahe's death. He was dining with the king, and had to go to the bathroom. Believing that to be breach of etiquette, Brahe decided to hold it in... and hold it in he did. After he got home, his urinary bladder burst, and that was that. (Let that be a lesson to all you out there: if you have to go, GO!)\n\nWas Brahe Jewish? Dying so stupidly is one thing, but do you think any Jew would fight a duel over a silly argument?",
