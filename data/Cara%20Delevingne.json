We just did it again. And again!)\n\nWe didn't listen. We watched Suicide Squad.\n\nWhy? Well, apparently we found out that British actress/model/starlet-d'jour Cara Delevingne is part Jewish, and wanted to see if her big screen breakthrough as the Enchantress would help write this profile. And it did! You're reading it right now.\n\nToo bad Delevingne can't act, and her Enchantress was quite possibly the worst part of a terrible, terrible movie.\n\nWhy, oh why did we watch Suicide Squad?!\n\nWe really should have listened to ourselves...",
