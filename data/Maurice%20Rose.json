  "description": "Maurice Rose is one of the greatest military figures in the history of the United States. A veteran of both World Wars, he fought bravely, receiving numerous accolades from multiple nations. During World War II, General Rose spearheaded the offensive against Germany. His division was the first to penetrate the Siegfried Line. And yes, Rose was Jewish.\n\nSadly, Rose did not see the ultimate victory. He was killed in combat just a month before V-E Day. And if one visits American Cemetery and Memorial, in Margraten, Netherlands, one can pay his tribute to a great Jewish American hero, Maurice Rose, buried there, as in a field of identical crosses, one stands above his resting place...\n\nWait a minute!\n\nYes, you heard that right. Maurice Rose, Jew, whose father and grandfather were rabbis, who even tried to keep kosher in the army, is buried under a cross. And it's not the case of mistaken identity: to escape persecution, Rose actually enlisted as a Christian.\n\nOh well. Considering the times, can't really fault him much here. But is it too much to ask someone to visit Margraten and scrape a little Star of David on that cross?",
