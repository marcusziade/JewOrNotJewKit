  "description": "There are many words that can be used to describe Bernie Madoff. A lot of them end with \"bag\".\n\nDirtbag. Douchebag. Scumbag.\n\nSadly, there is one word that can describe him that doesn't end with \"bag\".\n\nJew.\n\nYep, we're not too proud of this one.\n\nBut we have to be fair. After 450 profiles of, face it, mostly awesome Jews, we need to point out the not-so-awesome ones. Even the scumbags.\n\nOr, maybe we should look at it the other way. Maybe we should embrace Madoff. After all, he stole $50 billion. He is the greatest thief in the history of the world...\n\nSo we have the greatest thief ever. Whoopty-freaking-do. That still doesn't sit right.\n\nAre we absolutely sure Robin Hood wasn't Jewish?",
