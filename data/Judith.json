  "description": "The now-six-year-old has finally finished his Jewish preschool, which means two things:\n\nHello, public school and goodbye, tales of Jewish mythology. Oh, how we will miss those!\n\nEvery now and then, he would come home from school and retell what he learned about Jewish heroes. Judah Maccabee! Queen Esther! King David! Judith!\n\nWait, not Judith. Somehow they skipped that one...\n\nYou remember the story of Judith, right? She is a young widow who ingrains herself with Holofernes, the Assyrian general. He thinks she will give him Israeli secrets... and her body. Instead, she cuts off his head.\n\nIn fact, the Judith story is so popular that artists from Botticelli to Rembrandt to Klimt made her (and the severed head) a favorite subject. And yet, the preschool ignored it completely. We wonder why...\n\nSo much for that high-priced private education!",
