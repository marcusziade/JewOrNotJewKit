  "description": "Hello, Clarice.\n\nIt's been a while, Clarice.\n\nStraight to the questions, Clarice?\n\nWhy would you think I am, Clarice?\n\nThat makes little sense, Clarice.\n\nThink, Clarice. In that little head there must be a brain, Clarice.\n\nWhat languages do I speak, Clarice?\n\nDon't forget Polish, Clarice. But do I speak Yiddish, Clarice?\n\nWhere did I grow up, Clarice?\n\nWhere in Lithuania did I grow up, Clarice?\n\nAnd would a Jew ever own a castle in Lithuania, Clarice?\n\nPerhaps you should read up on your European history, Clarice. They didn't teach you well in that university, did they, Clarice?\n\n1944, Clarice. Where would you find a Jew in Lithuania in 1944, Clarice?\n\nThat's right, Clarice.\n\nCome back soon, Clarice.",
