  "description": "For 4000 years, no Jew has ever executed the headbutt.\n\nNot Herschel the Goatherder, when Baruch the Thief stole his prize goat.\n\nNot Rivka the Hairdresser, when Hena the Temptress stole her husband.\n\nHerschel sued Baruch in the local court. He got the goat back. Rivka went to Hena's house and broke all her dishes. She didn't get her husband back. Headbutting? That never entered the equation.\n\nSo how can anyone out there think that Zinedine Zidane is Jewish? Believe it or not, some people do. Maybe it's the Semitic looks. Maybe it's the unconventional name. Who knows.\n\nWell, Zidane is not Jewish; not even close. His parents are from Algeria, and he is a Muslim, be it an unobservant one.\n\nLawsuits? Passive-aggressive attacks? Emotionally destructive psychological abuse? Absolutely. But headbutts? Never.",
