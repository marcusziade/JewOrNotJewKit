  "description": "Contrary to popular belief, the Pythagorean Theorem is pretty simple. If we really wanted to, we could whip out a proof in this very spot, but... let's not.\n\nWhether Pythagoras was a Jew is pretty simple as well. He wasn't. But he might have been blessed in a Jewish temple, and, according to biographer Hermippus of Smyrna (not to be confused with Hermippus of Athens), he incorporated Jewish beliefs into his own philosophy.\n\nSo it does look like he had enough Jewish ties to be mentioned on our website. How is that for a pretty simple proof?",
