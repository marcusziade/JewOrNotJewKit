  "description": "Have we ever profiled three generations of Jews? Honestly, we can't recall. After 3383 profiles, they kinda run into each other. Two generations, easy, happens all the time. But three? (We're not counting Biblical characters for obvious reasons.)\n\nWell, here is three. Mickey Katz was a Borscht Belt comedian who dabbled in Yiddish-language musical parodies. He was also a klezmer musician. His name was Katz. Talk about a Jew!\n\nMickey had two sons, one of who is (previously profiled) Joel Grey, Oscar and Tony winner, both for \"Cabaret\". (Mickey's other son, Ronald, is an inventor of automatic call center technology. Profile-worthy? Perhaps, but... not much kvell there.)\n\nJoel had two children, one of whom is (previously profiled) Jennifer Grey, star of that 1980s classic(?), \"Dirty Dancing\". So there you go, our first(?) three generations of profiles!\n\nCan we get to four? Well, Jennifer has one daughter, Stella Gregg, who is an actress herself, but has not exactly broken through. (She has two credits to her name.) If we go in the other direction, Mickey's parents were Johanna and Menachem Katz, a tailor from Cleveland.\n\nSo, unlikely to get to four generations here. Give us another 3383 profiles?",
