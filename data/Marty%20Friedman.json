  "description": "Do you know who Sakura Gakuin is? No, you don't. Here, that's them.\n\n\n [X]\n\n\nIt's a pop group made out of junior high girls. It's very popular. It's Japanese. We don't need to explain it.\n\nWhat does Marty Friedman have to do with Sakura Gakuin? The former Megadeth guitarist writes their lyrics. Well, SOME of their lyrics. The Japanese pop machine throws 50 songwriters at each group, and Friedman is one of them.\n\nFriedman moved to Japan after quitting Megadeth a decade ago. During his time there, he's become quite a visible figure. He's hosted a number of TV shows, and has been called by some the \"Ryan Seacrest of Japan\". We're not sure if that's a compliment.\n\nAnd, yeah, he moonlights by writing Japanese pop songs. Not just for Sakura Gakuin, but for numerous other bands as well.\n\nBeats whatever Megadeth bandmate Dave Mustaine is doing, right?",
