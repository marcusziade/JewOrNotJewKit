  "description": "If you look at the photo on the left, you'll see the supporters of Ajax Amsterdam, one of the most storied clubs in all of soccer. They won the Dutch championship 30 times, and the prestigious Champions League four times, including three in a row in the 1970s, when it was called the European Cup.\n\nAnd if you look even more carefully in the photo, you will see an Israeli flag. In fact, that flag is seen all over Ajax's stadium.\n\nWhy? Are Ajax fans supporting an Israeli player? No Israeli has played for Ajax for decades. Then...\n\nIt turns out than Ajax fans, much like those of English club Tottenham Hotspur, has adopted a Jewish identity. Although very few Jews played for Ajax throughout its history, the club's old stadium was located close to Amsterdam's Jewish quarter. The fans have embraced the identity, flying Israeli flags, sporting Star of David tattoos, and calling themselves \"Super Jews\".\n\nSadly, the identity might be dying. Recently, Ajax management have tried to thwart it. And that's a shame.\n\nFor right now, there is a young Dutch boy in Amsterdam, clad in Ajax's red and white, who dreams of calling himself a \"Super Jew\"... How could anyone deny that dream?",
