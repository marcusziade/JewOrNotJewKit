  "description": "Who knew that the profile of Errol Barrow will be so easy to write?\n\nWe start by explaining who Errol Barrow was. The first Prime Minister of Barbados, he was instrumental in that island's independence from Britain. Barrow is still greatly revered in his home country. There is a statue of him in the middle of Independence Square in the capital of Bridgetown.\n\nWe continue by explaining Barrow's ties to Jewishness. His great-grandfather, Simon Barrow, was originally named Baruch.\n\nWe finish with an amusing anecdote. When Barrow visited Golda Meir, she questioned him about his Jewish roots. Barrow's response: \"Where do you think I get my brains from?\"\n\nWhat a perfect way to end the profile!",
