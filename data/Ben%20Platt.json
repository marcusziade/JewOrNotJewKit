  "description": "We have no interest in \"The Politician\", a new Netflix show that chronicles the rise to power of an ambitious student, but the premise is somewhat interesting. The first season takes places in high school, the second is going to be in college, and so forth, until our once-neophyte becomes the president of all the land, manufacturing his personality along the way. (Crazier things have happened in the real world, alas.)\n\nThe title character is played by Ben Platt, a Broadway darling making his transition to the small screen. On stage, he won a Tony for \"Dear Evan Hansen\". On Netflix, he plays a character ten years younger than himself. Theoretically, the difference would become more negligible as he gets older in the coming seasons.\n\nOn the show, Platt's (adopted) parents are played by Jews, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bob Balaban. Platt is Jewish as well, which raises a question... is he Jewish on the show? Theoretically, he can easily pass for goy (just like the aforementioned Miss Paltrow). Could his latent Jewishness somehow play a role in his campaign? Just imagine the pitfalls!\n\nPerhaps they will leave that terrible secret for the presidential run. (Crazier things have happened in the real world, alas.)",
