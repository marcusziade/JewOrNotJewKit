  "description": "Quentin Tarantino calls Christoph Waltz \"very similar\" to the character he plays in \"Inglourious Basterds\", Hans Landa. Considering that Landa is an officer in the SS known as a \"Jew Hunter\", it's not a comparison that should be made lightly.\n\nBut Tarantino clarifies it. \"Not the Nazi part,\" he says, \"but his erudition and his cleverness.\" Oh, and just to make it clear, \"Waltz's son is a rabbi in Israel\".\n\nWhew. And here we were worri... say what? His son is a who now? In... where? Christoph Waltz? The Aryan Austrian? CHRISTOPH Waltz? Could it be?\n\nWell, from the looks of it, Waltz himself is not Jewish. The Jewishness of his son most likely comes from Christoph's New Yorker ex-wife.\n\nStill, we wonder... What was Rabbi Waltz's service like the Friday night after \"Basterds\" premiere?",
