Lederman just coined the term in his book... \"The God Particle\", which explained the importance of the Higgs Boson. (Who did create the God Particle? Well, G-d? Right? No? The particle itself is G-d? Uhh... we're getting kinda deep here...) \n\nLederman actually had a different name in mind, but the publisher rejected \"The Goddamn Paricle\". All things considering, that title is a bit more spot-on.\n\nLederman was more than just a writer, as he won the Nobel for his work on neutrinos. (The Nobel for the Higgs Boson was awarded to others, including previously-profiled Francois Englert.)\n\nIn summary, Leon Lederman came up with \"the God Particle\". Semantics!",
