I guess I am Sleepless... in Des Moines! Oh, dear diary, I've had an awakening! Meg Ryan did it again! Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna start packing for New York! Maybe I'll meet my destiny at the top of the Empire State Building...\n\nHopeful, Jessica\nDecember 18, 1998Des Moines, Iowa\nDear Diary,\n\nIt looks like I've Got Mail!

I've been waiting for over 10 years! Is it too much to ask? Oh, sure, Julie \u0026 Julia was lots of fun, and it was partly set in New York... But where are the quirky, somewhat handsome yet obtainable, men? Where is romance? And, most importantly, where is Meg Ryan?\n\nStill waiting, Jessica\n\n\n.c {font-family: cursive;}\n.r {text-align: right;}",
