  "description": "Let's talk about digging up old graves. No, not about our lost dreams of following the footsteps of Indiana Jones, just your simple run-of-the-mill grave-dig-upping.\n\nIt happened last year to Judy Garland. The woman had been dead for close to 50 years, and was interred in Hartsdale, NY, a pilgrimage site for many of her fans. Well, her grave was dug up!\n\nLet's spare the sensationalism: it wasn't done by some rogues or crazy fanatics. It was dug up to move Garland's remains to Los Angeles... a Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nNo, no one discovered Garland's secret Jewish roots. She was moved because the NY cemetery had little space for her children, while the one in LA had room for all. (Garland's two non-Liza children are Jewish; two of her five husbands were.)\n\nSo, they now will be reunited in death. Probably the only justifiable reason for digging up old graves... sorry, Indiana.",
