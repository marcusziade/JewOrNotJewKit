  "description": "In 1963, the British government was toppled by a prostitution affair. If that sounds like something out of the movies, well, they made movies about it. Television shows too. Even a musical!\n\nThe so-called Profumo Affair centered around John Profumo, Secretary of State for War, and his relationship with \"model\" Christine Keeler, 27 years his junior. Profumo denied the affair, but the police proved that to be a lie. Soon after, it was discovered that Keeler also had a relationship with Soviet \"diplomat\" Yevgeny Ivanov... (Boy, we're using a lot of quotes here!)\n\nKeeler's BFF Mandy Rice-Davies was also a prominent figure in the affair. Although she never had a relationship with Profumo, her various dalliances with powerful men came to light during the trial that followed. When told that Lord Astor, a Conservative politician, denied meeting her, Rice-Davies famously said, \"Well he would, wouldn't he?\" That phrase became an aphorism that even entered the Oxford Dictionary.\n\nProfumo quickly resigned, but the damage to the Conservative Party was done. Soon after, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan resigned as well, and a year later, the Labour Party won the election.\n\nAs for Rice-Davies, she followed the affair by converting to Judaism after marrying a wealthy Israeli businessman.\n\nWell she would, wouldn't she?",
