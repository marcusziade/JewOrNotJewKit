  "description": "It's time for another installment of our \"Ask Jew or Not Jew\" feature, where young readers write in for advice. Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I promised my fiance I will take his last name, but I'm having second thoughts. Everyone will think I'm Jewish! — Kim Dixon, age withheld, Greenwich, Connecticut\n\nWait... here is another letter!\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, what can I do to convince my fiance to take my last name? She is not converting, this is the least she can do! — Nathan Klitstein, 22, Greenwich, Connecticut\n\nWell, well, what do we have here! Let's deal with Kim first. Just because you take a Jewish last name, people won't necessarily think you're Jewish. Just look at conservative blowhard Michelle Malkin. She married a Jew, she took his name, but no one in their right mind would think she is Jewish. All has to do is open her mouth.\n\nNow, Nathan. We understand that \"Kim Klitstein\" has a certain ring to it, but maybe you could compromise? Kim Klitstein-Dixon, perhaps? Or maybe Kim Dixon-Klitstein? Give it some thought!\n\nBest of luck on your pending nuptials,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
