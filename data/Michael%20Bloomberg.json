  "description": "About a year ago, we started a quest to find a prominent Jewish politician that we could be proud of. That quest went nowhere.\n\nWe looked at governors. We looked at senators. We got bored. We ended the quest on Dianne Feinstein, stating that being proud of a politician is an oxymoron.\n\nSome time passed. We profiled a few actors, athletes, and artists. Even a politician or two, without resuming our original quest.\n\nAnd then it hit us. We shouldn't have been looking at governors, or senators, or attempting to reveal Jewish roots of dead presidents. We should have looked in our backyard.\n\nNew York City.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nProminent? Check.\n\nJewish? Check.\n\nRespectable? Definitely.\n\nQuest over? Well, for Bloomberg's sake, let's hope so. Remember, it was the Eliot Spitzer scandal that started our quest. And before that, Mr. Spitzer sure seemed prominent, Jewish, and respectable...\n\n(Editor's update: Let's just call this quest over, one way or another.)",
