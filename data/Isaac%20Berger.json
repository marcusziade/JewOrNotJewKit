  "description": "As much as we love the Olympics, let's face it, most of these sports are not exactly... useful in a real life situation.\n\nArchery might have been hot at the time of Robin Hood, but, unless you live in West Virginia, it's unlikely that you will use a bow and arrow to bag your dinner.\n\nCanoe/kayak? Sure, we like to go white-water rafting now and again... Wait, that's not right. We're Jews. We're not going white-water rafting.\n\nHammer throw? Triple jump? Synchronizing swimming? Yeah... no.\n\nThere is one clear exception, however: weightlifting. No, we don't expect anyone to lug around barbells... but the ability to pick up heavy objects clearly has it advantages.\n\nAnd, yes, there have been a number of Jewish weightlifting medalists. Ike Berger, for example, won gold in 1956 and added silvers in 1960 and 1964.\n\nBerger is still going strong, and we're sure is always around when his friends and family need to move furniture.\n\nOn second thought, being a weightlifter might not be so useful after all...",
