  "description": "If you have watched \"Survivor\" through the years, you can't help but know Russell Hantz... quite possibly the best player to NOT win the game, and quite possibly the game's most despicable villain.\n\nHantz famously made the finals in his first season, using ultra-aggressive strategy rarely seen before and only feebly imitated since. He lost. Using the same techniques, he made the finals in the follow-up all-star season. He lost. He returned again, tried the same strategy... and got voted out second. The cat was out of the bag by then: this guy was bad news. Get him out as soon as possible, or prepare to get your throat sliced.\n\nRussell has burned quite a few Survivor bridges in America, so he had to go to Australia to appear on its version of the show, where he unleashed a surprise. No, not a new strategy. This. Those of us who saw him wear a giant cross on the American version were scratching our heads.\n\nWell, Russell is definitely not Jewish, he just got the tattoo because of his \"love for the Jewish people\". You know, we'll just let it be.\n\nSo how did Russell do on Australian Survivor? He played ultra-aggressively... and was voted out second.\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nswapPic('r/russell_hantz','hantz');\n}",
