  "description": "One thing we like to harp on at this site is that you shouldn't believe stereotypes. \n\nSome people look as Kosher as a canned ham but turn out to have an extra helping of secret Jewish ingredients (Gwyneth Paltrow is a prime example). On the other hand, we've seen many people who look so Jewish they're only a yarmulke short of being ordained a rabbi (Jason Biggs comes to mind), only to discover they're not Jewish at all.\n\nSo never believe a stereotype, OK? Never. Unless it's true.\n\nBecause, you see, it would be almost impossible to find someone who looks more Jewish than Eugene Levy (Depending on who you are, you know him as Biggs' father in the American Pie movies, an ensemble cast member in the Christopher Guest films, or as the man whose eyebrows consumed Cheboygan, Michigan last fall.)\n\nBut don't go looking for the big AHA! revelation at the end of this profile. Eugene Levy is not half-Italian. He never converted to Buddhism, or had a nose job to look more Jewish than he really is. \n\nEugene Levy looks Jewish because he is Jewish. Sometimes it's as simple as that.",
