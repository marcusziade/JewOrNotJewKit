  "description": "Have we got a television show idea for you! Critics swoon over \"The Americans\", the cable drama about KGB agents. And everyone loves \"The Mentalist\" on CBS! (Well, old people like \"The Mentalist\".) Why not combine the two!\n\nImagine: a boy grows up in Soviet Russia. Let's not make him Russian, so the viewers can better identify with him... let's make him Jewish!\n\nThe boy has a gift: he can see things no one can see. When he grows up, the KGB gets wind, and he gets thrown into a world of crime! No wrongdoer can elude him! No crime can go unsolved! Can he use his mental powers for good? Of course, since this is Soviet Russia, what exactly IS good...\n\nMystery! Espionage! Mind reading! Intrigue! Russians!\n\nWe can call it \"Wolf Messing, KGB Mentalist\"!\n\nSounds too unrealistic?",
