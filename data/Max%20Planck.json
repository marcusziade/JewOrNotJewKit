  "description": "The Nazis really wanted Max Planck to be Jewish. Sadly for them, he wasn't Jewish. Maybe he was a little Jewish?\n\nYou know, Max Planck. Of that constant. Brilliant physicist. Creator of quantum theory. Nobel prize laureate. Friend of Einstein. Oh, yeah, that might have played a role. Friend of other Jews. Are we sure he wasn't Jewish?\n\nYou see, Planck rejected antisemitism and went out of his way to protect Jewish scientists. So the Nazis decided to invent a Jewish relative for him. A parent would be easily disproved, so would a grandparent... Why not a great-grandparent, Nazis thought? That would have made Planck 1/16 Jewish.\n\nHe wasn't. Planck was born and raised Lutheran with no Jewish heritage.\n\nThere are infinitesimally few things that we agree with Nazis about, but apparently the verdict below is one of them:",
