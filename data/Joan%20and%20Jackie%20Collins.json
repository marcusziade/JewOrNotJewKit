  "description": "It's time for another installment of our \"Ask Jew or Not Jew\" feature, where young readers write in for advice. Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I really don't know what to do about my older sister. She is the most popular girl in school! Boys line up to fight over her, and no one even gives me a look! All I can do is bury myself in romance novels! Why can't I be like her? Why? WHY?????? â€” Ashley Rappaport, 16, Skokie, Illinois\n\nDear Ashley,\n\nWe'll venture a guess that life is not that wonderful for your sister either. Perhaps she looks at you and wishes for your life? No? Maybe?\n\nOr maybe you need to take inspiration from the Collins sisters, Joan and Jackie. Joan is older and clearly more glamorous. She was on that show \"Dynasty\"... errr... you probably never heard of it. It's from the 80s. Big hair. Ask your mother.\n\nJackie, on the other hand, is clearly the more frumpy one, but she is no less successful. In fact, she is one of the most prominent romance novelists (aha!) out there. So... it all worked out? Maybe?\n\nActually, you know what? Stop worrying about it, everything will all change after high school anyway.\n\nMaybe.\n\nYours in sibling conflict,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
