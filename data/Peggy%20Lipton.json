  "description": "What do Elvis Presley, Sammy Davis Jr., and Paul McCartney have in common? Other than being profiled on this website, that is.\n\nThey all used to date Peggy Lipton, the beauty from 60s/70s cop drama \"Mod Squad\" (Tagline: \"One White, One Black, One Blonde.\" Oh, 60s/70s...)\n\nAmong other Lipton conquests: Keith Moon, Terence Stamp (General Zod in \"Superman\"), Stamp's brother, and, we assume, some others. Somehow, Peggy managed to slip in a 16-year-marriage to musician Quincy Jones in the middle of that whole romp.\n\nBut we are not concerned with Lipton's sexual record. More power to her, we say. We're concerned with her being Jewish. And she is, raised in a family of observant Jews.\n\nBut being such a child of the 60s/70s, Lipton veered outside Judaism: she was an early follower of Scientology. According to some, it was her pushing Scientology on Elvis that led to their break-up. But Lipton left the cult, and raised her two daughters Jewish (including previously-profiled Rashida Jones).\n\nMore power to her indeed.",
