  "description": "Dear Spanish speakers,\n\nCan you help us out? Do you watch \"Better Call Saul\"? How is Hector Salamanca's Spanish accent?\n\nYou see, some of us speak a foreign language (not Spanish), and whenever we hear a non-native speaker attempt to speak it in movies or on TV, we judge. And we laugh. These are actors! How hard is it to learn to pronounce foreign words? (We're looking at you, Keri Russell!)\n\nYes, Mark Margolis, the actor who plays Salamanca, is definitely not a native Spanish speaker. He is a Philadelphia-born Jew... even though he tends to play a lot of Hispanic roles, from \"Scarface\" to \"Breaking Bad\", now continuing that role on \"Saul\". Of course, on \"Bad\" he didn't have to talk...\n\nSo we assume that after all those roles, he got the accent down. But let us know for sure, Spanish speakers.",
