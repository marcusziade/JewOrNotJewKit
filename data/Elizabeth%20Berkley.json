  "description": "We admit it, we watched Saved by the Bell. No, we didn't watch it for Elizabeth's character Jessie, who did have a bizarro-Emmy moment in the episode where she gets addicted to caffeine pills.\n\nAnd then, there's Showgirls.\n\nAfter Saved by the Bell, we had no idea what would become of Jessie; the buck-toothed too-tall frilly-haired anything-but-beauty looked to be destined for anything but stardom.\n\nAnd then, there's Showgirls.\n\nSo of course, it shocked us to find that Berkley is not only a Jew, but also a practicing Jew, such a rarity in today's Jewish Hollywood.\n\nAnd then, there's Showgirls.\n\nWhich means it's not fine to eat shellfish or get a tattoo, but it's perfectly normal to strip naked and lick a pole? We guess it was just a movie...\n\nIt wasn't just a movie, it was Showgirls.",
