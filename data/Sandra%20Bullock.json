  "description": "Who is the Queen of Jew or Not Jew?\n\nWhose name is searched the most, whose profile is read more than any other woman's?\n\nScarlett Johansson would have been our guess. She is extremely popular, extremely beautiful, has a non-Jewish last name, but is a Jew. But no, it's not Scarlett.\n\nNatalie Portman? Who doesn't love Natalie Portman? Well, our readers do, but not enough for the #1 spot.\n\nBarbra Streisand? Please. Don't make us laugh.\n\nNo. The Queen of Jew or Not Jew is... the subject of this very profile. Strange but true: you, the readers, have wondered if Sandra Bullock is Jewish more often than any other woman.\n\nAnd why would anyone think Sandra is Jewish? Well, a couple of reasons. First, her mother's name is Helga Meyer, but that last name is as likely to be ethnically German as it is Jewish. And considering Helga was born in Germany in 1942 and that Sandra used to go to Germany to celebrate Christmas, let's just say that the latter is quite, quite unlikely.\n\nSecond, Bullock gave her adopted baby boy a bris. But there was nothing Jewish behind the act. She wanted to keep the adoption quiet, so they couldn't go to the hospital, and how else can you get a baby circumcised? Call a mohel, of course! Unless you want to do it yourself... Please, for the love of G-d, don't do it yourself!\n\nNot that we wouldn't mind having Miss Bullock. Especially the mid-90s version. But, sadly, we can no more go backward in time than we can claim her as a Jew.\n\nEven if she is our website's Queen.",
