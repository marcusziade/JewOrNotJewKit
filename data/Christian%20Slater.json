  "description": "Today, we're gonna reference a mostly forgotten 80s teen movie. And, no, despite this being a profile of Christian Slater, the movie is not \"Heathers\". Oh well.\n\nThe movie is \"The Legend of Billie Jean\", starring Helen Slater as the titular character and Christian Slater as her brother. Because of the identical last names, people assumed they are siblings in real life as well. And since Helen is Jewish, well, you know...\n\nNo, they are not siblings, and, no, Christian is not Jewish. (That first name is the obvious giveaway.) So that's that.\n\nAs for the movie itself? Sorry, we've never seen it.\n\nMaybe we should have just talked about \"Heathers\"...",
