  "description": "Alan Perlis, pioneering computer scientist, the first winner of the Turing Prize, in his own quotes:\n\n\n\"One man's constant is another man's variable.\"\n\n\"It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.\"\n\n\"Optimization hinders evolution.\"\n\n\"If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.\"\n\n\"In seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way.\"\n\n\"There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.\"\n\n\"The proof of a system's value is its existence.\"\n\n\"Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.\"\n\n\"A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.\"\n\n\nWas Perlis Jewish? Look at that last quote. Do you have to ask?",
