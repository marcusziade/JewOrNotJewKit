  "description": "Astute visitors to our website might have noticed a new category we added a few months ago: Religious Figures. We created it to move Biblical profiles from the Historical Figures category... because, face it, the historical validity of, say, Esau, is hard to prove.\n\nAnd, as a result, the category got its share of various religious wackos (your Jews for Jesus, satanists, popes, etc) who were previously listed in Uncategorized. So now Religious Figures is one weird hodgepodge.\n\nWith one important omission.\n\nOne would think that a Jewish website that profiles Religious Figures would have at least one rabbi listed. But no. Not one. (Yet we have our Jews for Jesus, satanists, popes, etc).\n\nWell, that can't be. So who better to be our first rabbi than Moshe ben Maimon, one of the greatest minds in Jewish history. Maimonides, as he is known, authored the 14-volume Mishneh Torah, the code of Jewish law. And he was also a doctor and a philosopher (talk about a medieval Jewish mother's dream!).\n\nAnd, what do you know, the first perfect Jew Score for a religious figure! Seriously, who did you expect to get that, a pope?",
