  "description": "Don't ask us how, but we unearthed this clip from a conversation between Angelina Jolie and husband Brad Pitt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, there you have it. Straight out of the horse's (horse's? The last word we'd ever use to describe Angelina...) mouth. Angelina Jolie. Jewish. We'd never think so... but we'll take it. Oh, will we ever take it.\n\nBut then, we started thinking. The clip only shows one small part of the conversation. We really don't know in what context those words were said.\n\nPerhaps the two are on a road trip and are sharing hilarious jokes? Seriously, look at the cross hanging from the rearview mirror. No one  Jewish, secretly or not, would even own a cross that large (15th century Spanish marranos excluded).\n\nWhat? This is from a movie, \"Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Smith\"? That means... Angelina is not really Jewish? But... we have it on tape!\n\nStupid Hollywood.",
