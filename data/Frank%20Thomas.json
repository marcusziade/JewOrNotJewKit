  "description": "When you think of Frank Thomas, who do you think of? (No, not Frank Thomas the actor or Frank Thomas the animator or Frank Thomas the football player. The Frank Thomas pictured here!)\n\nDo you think of Frank Thomas, the baseball Hall of Famer, or Frank Thomas, the boner pill pitch man? (Alright, fine, Thomas pitches testosterone vitamins. Close enough to \"boner pills\"!)\n\nThose who remember Thomas for his baseball prowess (he was one of the most feared hitters of the 90s) probably think we're silly for emphasizing his boner pills ad. Well, do you remember Jim Palmer? And if you do, do you remember Jim Palmer as the Hall of Fame pitcher or as the underwear pitch man? (If not for that cameo in \"Naked Gun\"?) Come on, it's underwear. Which, in the grand scheme of things, might be a step up from boner pills?\n\nIn any case, the reason you see Frank Thomas on this website is that he was married to a Jewish woman and has fathered three Jewish children. (There were rumors that he converted upon marriage, but that does not look to be the case.) He is now married to a goyishe woman... and is hawking boner pills.\n\nCoincidence?",
