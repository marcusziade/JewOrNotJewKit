  "description": "Who was Morris Cohen?\n\nChina, 1922. Sun Yat-sen is leading the revolution that will overthrow the Qing Dynasty. Fighting alongside is \"Two-Gun\" Cohen.\n\nMorris Cohen was born in Poland, his family escaping to England soon after his birth. There, he was arrested for pickpocketing, and his parents shipped him off to Canada, hoping that life in the prairies would somehow reform their wayward son.\n\nIt didn't exactly work, for in Canada, Cohen started out working on a farm, but quickly moved into gambling and grifting, ending up in jail. He then fought in World War I, started to work for the Canadian Railways, and, in 1922, went to China to close a business deal with Sun. And decided to stay.\n\nCohen trained Sun's forces, and served as his personal bodyguard, carrying two guns that earned him his nickname. After his patron died in 1925, Cohen stayed in China, working for various leaders and warlords. When Japan invaded, he fought for the Chinese, worked for British intelligence, and was captured in 1941.\n\nTwo years later, the Japanese exchanged Cohen for another prisoner, and he settled in Canada and then England, spinning tall tales of his adventures.\n\nOr... do you mean Morris Cohen?\n\nsetTitle('Morris Cohen');",
