  "description": "They say that everything is cyclical. Fashion, music, hair... let's talk about hair.\n\nPictured is Susanna Hoffs. Rather attractive, isn't she? This is a pretty recent photo; she rose to fame in the 80s, as the lead singer of The Bangles. And, yes, she is Jewish.\n\nSo, you must be thinking, if Susanna looks so good now, in her 50s, how did she look back then? She must have been a knockout!\n\nYikes!\n\n [X]\n\n\nYes, believe your eyes, that is the much younger Susanna. Consumed by the monster known as 80s hair. It has claimed many victims, and Susanna clearly was not immune.\n\nSo, dear women, we beg you... Don't bring 80s hair back. And while you're at it, no 80s fashion as well. 80s music? Well, it did give us The Bangles, which led to this profile...",
