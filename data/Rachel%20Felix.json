  "description": "Did you know that Napoleon had a Jewish grandson? Pretty cool, isn't it?\n\nThis is the story of Elisabeth Felix, perhaps the most famous actress in Europe of the mid-19th century. Born to a family of Jewish peddlers, she began to act in her teens and quickly became a star (before the concept of a star was even a thing). Taking on the pseudonym of Mademoiselle Rachel, she conquered the stages of Paris, and toured the world from Moscow to Havana.\n\nAlong the way, she shtupped.\n\nAmong Rachel's many lovers were Prince de Joinville (son of King Louis Phillippe), Louis Napoleon (who later became Napoleon III) and Napoleon's illegitimate son Count Alexandre Walewski (man, she sure liked her Bonapartes!). It is with the latter that she had a son... Napoleon's Jewish grandson.\n\nJewish, because Rachel refused to convert to Christianity or baptize her children, despite the overt antisemitism and the enormous pressure to do so. Pretty cool, isn't it?",
