  "description": "You can't escape AI anymore. For every single television commercial imploring us to buy AI-empowered this or that, to obtuse websites using AI to generate content, to...\n\nYou know what? Let's not oversimplify this, because that's what basically everyone is doing now: oversimplifying AI. There is good AI and bad AI, and we're not talking here about the AI that will eventually take over the world. That's not bad, that's evil AI.\n\nBad AI is the garbage that is currently spat out by ChatGPT and its ilk. Sorry, there is no other way to put it. Sure, it produces coherent text, but to what extent? We're not even going to get into factual mistakes here. What these models produce is, by definition, mediocre plagiarism, and we don't need computers to do that. Just open any C student's high school English paper. (Which, from this point on, will be written by ChatGPT and its ilk.)\n\nGood AI is AI that is actually helping people. Take protein design, a highly important scientific problem that can have huge implications in medicine, energy, and biotechnology. Well, AI is helping to figure it out! This year's Nobel in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker, Jew (as well as two goyim) for using AI to design proteins.\n\nOne can only hope that this current proliferation of AI will lead to more good AI usage. As for evil AI... Well, we can hold out hope for as long as possible.",
