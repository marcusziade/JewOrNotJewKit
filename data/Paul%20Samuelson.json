  "description": "Paul Samuelson was the first American (and the first Jew) to win the Nobel in Economics, in 1970. The Nobel Committee said that he \"has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory\".\n\nSamuelson basically founded neo-Keynesian economics. He became a professor at MIT at the age of 25. He advised JFK and LBJ. He has been called the \"father of modern economics\" and the \"foremost academic economist of the 20th century\".\n\nSamuelson literally wrote the textbook on economics. Entitled... well, \"Economics\", it has been continuously published (with revisions) since 1948.\n\nIn 1961, Samuelson predicted that the Soviet Union will bypass the United States in GNP by the 1990s.\n\nNobody is perfect?",
