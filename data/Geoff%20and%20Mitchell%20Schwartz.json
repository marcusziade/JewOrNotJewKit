  "description": "In 1923, Jewish brothers Ralph and Arnold Horween played in the NFL for the Chicago Cardinals. They did so under the name McMahon. This was done not to hide their Jewishness, but so their mother didn't know they played pro football. Talk about Jewish mothers!\n\nWell, it looks like Jewish mothers had something to say about it. That was the last time Jewish brothers played in the NFL until 2012, when offensive lineman Mitchell Schwartz made his debut for the Browns. He joined older brother and fellow lineman Geoff, who had previously spent four years with the Panthers before signing with the Vikings during the offseason. (BTW, Geoff, you should have read the Greg Camarillo profile about the dangers of Jews playing in Minnesota. You think it's a coincidence you started the year injured?)\n\nAnd their mother? Oh, she is fine with her boys now, with Geoff growing to be 6'6\", 340 lbs, and Mitchell not lagging far behind at 6'5\", 320. But of course she was worried when they were starting out! Many things might change in 89 years, but certainly not Jewish mothers...\n\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nt = 'geoff';\nif (x == 1) t = 'mitchell';\nsetImage('nfl/'+t+'_schwartz');\n}",
