  "description": "Over 100 years ago, Julius Hirsch was one of Germany's biggest soccer stars. He led his teams to two national championships, played in the 1912 Olympics, and scored four goals in one game against the Netherlands.\n\nHirsch then went off to World War I, fought bravely for his country, and was awarded the Iron Cross. We'll let you guess what happened next...\n\nHirsch didn't think that the Germans would harm him; he represented his country in sport and in war. It didn't matter. He was a Jew, so to Auschwitz he went, and from Auschwitz he did not return.\n\nWe look at Germany today, the rising tide of its far right, and can't help but be afraid that history will repeat itself.\n\nOf course, that is not exclusive to Germany.",
