  "description": "We were watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (the original series, of course) the other day. Yes, this is our life now: watching every one of 200 episodes of a 20-year-old cartoon show. There are worse ways to pass time.\n\nIn any case, in one episode, Donatello (he is the smart one) made a Kosher joke and said \"oy, vey\". \"Aha!\", we exclaimed. \"How many times have we been asked if a character is Jewish just because they say that phrase! How do we always respond? It's not a Jewish thing, it's a New York thing! Well, here is proof! There is no way Donatello is Jewish, he is a freaking ninja turtle!\" And we went back to the show, watching the turtles kick Shredder's ass once again.\n\nThen, as the episodes piled on, we started to wonder if any of the characters were voiced by Jews. Turns out there was at least one: Donatello! (Jews got the smart one, natch.) Character actor Barry Gordon had quite a career: he started out as a child, appeared on Broadway, acted in numerous sitcoms and TV movies, hosted talks shows. He even served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and ran for Congress. And, yeah, Donatello (clearly the apex).\n\nSo, does that mean our favorite turtle could be Jewish? Let's pass on that verdict. After all, this is a profile of Gordon, not Donatello.",
