  "description": "If stereotypes are to be believed, Jewish people have big noses. And, as most stereotypes have roots in truth, so does this one. But... so what. There are many worse ethnic traits to have. Big noses add character.\n\nWhich brings us to Sarah Jessica Parker, whose half-Jewish roots have blessed her with a schnoz to end all schnozes. A schnoz so prominent that even one look at her face etches it in memory and requires hours of mental soap to scrub it off the hippocampus. It really is a giant schnoz. And it really is not proportionate with the rest of her body.\n\nYet... somehow it works for some out there. Somehow, Parker has risen to sex symbol status. Somehow, some find this unproportionally exotic and appealing. But not us.\n\nFor us, a big nose is not exotic or appealing. We've seen so many of them, from every uncle Joseph to every aunt Miriam. It's just that... even poor aunt Miriam is no match for Parker.\n\nIt really is a giant schnoz.",
