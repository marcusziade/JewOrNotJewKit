  "description": "Because we strive for accuracy above everything here on JONJ, we need to point out something that might have confused our readers.\n\nDustin Diamond, the actor who portrayed Screech on Saved by the Bell, is, sadly, Jewish. We will refer you to his profile for details of his lameness (see the handy \"see also\" section below).\n\nHowever, the character of Screech was NOT Jewish, his Uncle Murray be damned. How do we know? On at least one episode, it is mentioned that Screech's family attends church. Yes, we admit to watching it the show. We were young. We didn't know any better. Kelly Kapowski was really hot. How many excuses do you really need?\n\nSo forgive us for using the actor's and the character's name interchangeably. We promise to be more careful in the future. You should only expect the best from JONJ. Even when we talk about the dorkiest character in television history.\n\nSheesh, when we did we start to take ourselves so seriously?",
