  "description": "Today, our worldwide search for Jews will take us to Angola. What, you don't think we'll find an important Jew in Angola? Just you wait!\n\nTo be fair, Arcadi Gaydamak is not your average Angolan Jew (although, all things considering, he might be the ONLY Angolan Jew, which would make him precisely average). Born in the Soviet Union, Gaydamak emigrated to Israel in the 1970s, before making his way to France. He came back to Israel in the early 2000s, where he dabbled in philanthropy, politics, and sports team ownership.\n\nSo what about Angola?\n\nWell, Gaydamak played a rather large role in that country's civil war of the 1990s. In what was dubbed (wait for it!) Angolagate, he, along with two Frenchmen (one of them the son of France's president), helped supply the Angolan government with weapons. For that, Angola rewarded Gaydamak with citizenship. In France, that got him a conviction in abstentia that somehow ended up being overturned... but he did spend some time in jail for tax evasion.\n\nAnd that's it for Jews and Angola...",
