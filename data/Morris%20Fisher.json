  "description": "Morris Fisher just might be one of the greatest Jewish champions of all time, but you rarely see him on various Jewish athlete lists. It might have to do with a rather strange gravestone.\n\nFirst things first: Fisher was a marksman, an Olympic shooter who participated in the 1920 and 1924 games. He took home FIVE gold medals in various shooting categories.\n\n\nFisher was not just an Olympian; he was also a marine who took part in both World Wars. So when it came time to die, he was interned next to his military brethren at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego. Fisher lies under this gravestone.\n\nYou clearly see the point of contention, but let's deal first with two other inconsistencies. Why is \"Hungary\" so prominent? Fisher was born in Ohio; his parents were Hungarian Jews, but who knows if he ever set foot in that country.\n\nThen there is the birthdate. Documents from Fisher's life clearly show it as May 4, 1890. Yet the gravestone shows a date two years and one day later.\n\nAnd then, of course, the cross. Documents and publications identify Fisher as Jewish. Why the damned cross, then?\n\nHere are our best guesses:\n\nEither Fisher converted to Christianity late in his life, or there is confusion with another Morris Fisher, or the cross, like the birthdate and Hungary, is just a mistake, an oversimplification that we sometimes see on military graves...\n\nThat being said, here's our best guess:",
