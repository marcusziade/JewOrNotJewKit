When I was 11, my mother decided she didn't want me to be Jewish, and took me to Europe to marry a prince. I was educated at the Sorbonne, but that wedding didn't take, so I came back to America. There, I changed my name, dated George Gershwin, and starred in movies and on stage. For over five decades, I appeared on TV as a panelist on 'To Tell the Truth'. Signed, Kitty Carlisle.\"\n\nSo, which one is the real Kitty Carlisle?
