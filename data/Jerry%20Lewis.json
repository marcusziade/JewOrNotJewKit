Although I am sure it is better than your insignifiante fran\ufffdais.\n\nI was sitting in a caf\ufffd, sipping my morning caf\ufffd au lait and chomping on a croissant, when my ma\ufffdtresse showed me your web-site on her wi-fi. My b\ufffdret jumped in the air! What an idea magnifique!\n\nI spent minutes browsing your web-site. So many Juifs! Some of the profils are quite humoristique. Some are quite agr\ufffdable. Others not so.\n\nBut I ask you, mon cher Juifs am\ufffdricains, where is the profil of master com\ufffddien Jerry Lewis? You have various humoristes am\ufffdricains profiled on your web-site, but no Jerry Lewis! What an omission terrible!\n\nNo Juif web-site is compl\ufffdte without Jerry Lewis! Not only is he the funniest com\ufffddien, he is the funniest Am\ufffdricain ever! Perhaps his humour sophistiqu\ufffd is a little avanc\ufffde for your minds am\ufffdricain?\n\nI also see that you ridiculis\ufffd mimes in the Marcel Marceau profil. Tr\ufffds horrible, mon cher Juifs am\ufffdricains. Tr\ufffds horrible!\n\nWith amour,\nYour friend fran\ufffdais",
