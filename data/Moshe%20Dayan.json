  "description": "Dear children!\n\nWe need to warn you. Eye patches are not cool!\n\nSure, you might look at your favorite eye-patch-wearing heroes, such as Irish novelist James Joyce, Israeli general Moshe Dayan, or David Bowie alter ego Halloween Jack and think: wow, that's a neat look! It's not. Eye patches usually come with a gruesome backstory. Dayan didn't really want to go through his whole life looking like a pirate, you can bet on that.\n\nDayan's eye patch came when a bullet shattered his binoculars, sending shards of glass into his eye. The injury was so bad, it almost killed him! The resulting damage was so large, he couldn't be fitted with a glass eye. The eye patch was the only option.\n\nNo, dear children, please leave wearing eye patches to those who actually need them... and hipsters.",
