  "description": "The last two seasons of \"Entourage\" have been criticized at length. Supposedly, the show, once a cunning satire of Hollywood, has lost its edge.\n\nMaybe that's the case. But you know what? It doesn't matter. We still watch. Why?\n\nTwo words: Ari. Gold.\n\nThe Jewish super-agent, based on Jewish super-agent Ari Emanuel, and played brilliantly by Jeremy Piven (to the tune of three Emmy awards), OWNS the show. We don't care if Vince and his buddies get stupider by the episode. As long as Ari remains Ari, spewing venom and showing who really runs Hollywood (clue: it's NOT the goyim), we'll keep watching.\n\nOh, and two more words: Johnny. Drama. (Not a Jew.) Seriously, critics. There are two characters on the show who are always good for some laughs. With all the dreck on TV nowadays, what more can you ask for?",
