  "description": "Let's get it out of the way before it gets weird. The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, is not Jewish. She is a fairy Jewish godmother. Trust us, it's gonna get much weirder than that. MUCH.\n\nIn Argentina, there is a legend that every family's seventh-born son is cursed. To avoid a terrible fate, that son gets adopted by another family. The legend became a tradition, which is carried through even today. Argentina's politicians (especially those who hold the country's highest office), \"adopt\" these seventh-born. Become their godparents, that is.\n\nOriginally, the tradition only applied to Christian families, but, for whatever reason, Jews felt excluded. Until this year, that is, when Kirchner became a godmother to a Jewish boy, Yair Tawil.\n\nSo, what legend do Argentinians believe even in this, the 21st century? What is this terrible curse that falls upon every seventh-born? \n\nHe is supposed to turn into a werewolf.\n\nIt just got weird.",
