  "description": "You're Ian Fleming, creator of one of the most iconic characters of all time, James Bond. You have an extramarital affair with Blanche Blackwell, a Jamaican woman of Jewish descent. And you want to immortalize her. Perhaps to piss off your wife. Or not. In any case, what do you do?\n\nYou base a character after her! And not just a character, a femme fatale mob boss! How is that for immorality!\n\nOh, and you make her a lesbian.\n\nThat's right, Fleming decided to make the character based on his lover a lesbian. It's rather clear in the book and hinted at in the movie. Strange, obviously.\n\nBut not as strange as the name Fleming gave her. Not that we wouldn't expect it from the master of double entendre, but why would you name the character based on your lover PUSSY GALORE?\n\nBecause naming her Large Vagina would have been a tad too obvious.\n\nPerhaps Plenty O'Snatch?",
