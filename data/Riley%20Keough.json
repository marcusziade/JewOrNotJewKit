  "description": "We're getting really tired of people telling us to correct our Elvis profile because of his supposed Jewish ancestry. It's getting old. Yes, there are rumors out there, but there are also people (not us!) who do actual genealogical research... and there is absolutely nothing Jewy on his family tree.\n\nBut you know does have Jewish ancestry? Elvis' granddaughter! It comes from the other side, obviously.\n\nThat would be model-turned-actress Riley Keough. She can be seen in such films as \"Magic Mike\", \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", and a bunch of independent movies you probably have never heard of. Riley is the daughter of Lisa Marie Presley, who is the daughter of Elvis and our favorite Naked Gun cougar, Priscilla Presley. The Jewishness comes through Riley's paternal grandfather, if you really want to know the specifics.\n\nOf course, through Priscilla, Riley has another famous relative... Her stepfather, Michael Jackson.\n\nThankfully, no Jewish ancestry rumors about that one.",
