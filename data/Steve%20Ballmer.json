  "description": "When we were about to graduate college, an opportunity to work at Microsoft arose. So we took the free trip to gorgeous Redmond, Washington and enjoyed their spacious, magnificent campus. We met dozens of people all in love with their job, who all drank Jolt cola and all thought that Microsoft was the greatest thing since sliced bread.\n\nThat was the last time we ever met Microsoft acolytes.\n\nThink about it: how many times have you heard people profess their love for Apple products? Or Google? Almost daily, it seems like. As for Microsoft... its employees are its fans. It begins and ends there.\n\nOh, Microsoft tries, does it ever. It comes up with ads depicting it as hip and cool. Those ads work on a grand total of exactly zero people. Its CEO, the Jewish Steve Ballmer, screams like a lunatic while bashing his competitors at every opportunity... That's not helping either.\n\nSo no, we didn't get the job. Just as well.\n\nBut we tell you what, we wouldn't mind working for Apple... or Google.",
