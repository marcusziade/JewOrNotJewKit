  "description": "It's inconceivable, people tell us.\n\nIt's inconceivable that we have this great website, but some of our profiles are just not up to par.\n\nSo many Jews, so many great people devoted to their Judaism, yet we don't delve into the details. We reduce them to a single aspect of their life. We don't even mention exactly how they are Jewish! It's inconceivable!\n\nTake actor Wallace Shawn. You guessed it right: for the umpteenth time, we're gonna have a profile that references \"The Princess Bride\". We're not going to delve into Shawn's rather accomplished family, or his work on Broadway, or \"My Dinner with Andre\", or even his Jewishness. Nope... we're going to reference a 25-year-old movie in which Shawn plays a vital, but rather small role.\n\nInconceivable!",
