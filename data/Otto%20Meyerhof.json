  "description": "If you're like us, you know quite a few Jews. (We run a Jewy website; it comes with the territory.) We're willing to bet that none of those Jews are named Otto.\n\nOtto was actually pretty popular in America in the late 1800s... and dropped off the cliff as the US the first World War against Germany. The second didn't help either. (It's somehow on a small uptick now. We'd venture a guess that very few of these newly-minted 21st-century Ottos are Jewish.)\n\nAnd yet, Otto Meyerhof is the ninth Jewish Otto we're profiling. They  were all born in German-speaking countries at the tail end at the 19th century. Oh, did the Germans adore their Ottos! Somehow, three of these Ottos have something else in common: they won the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Otto Meyerhof was first in 1922, with previously-profiled Otto Warburg and Otto Loewi following suit in 1931 and 1936, respectively.\n\nWe're willing to bet you have never met a Jew with Meyerhof's middle name either.\n\nFritz.",
