  "description": "Four Five years ago, in the profile of Israeli gymnast Alexander Shatilov, we lamented that he was running out of chances to win an Olympic medal. Shatilov, a specialist in floor exercise, came somewhat close, but could never break through.\n\nShatilov did get another chance in Tokyo, but he is a bit past his prime. However, we did get an Israeli Jewish gymnastics floor medalist: Shatilov's friend, teammate, and fellow ex-Soviet emigre Artem Dolgopyat, who improbably tumbled to gold for Israel's first ever gymnastics medal. (Just its second gold EVER.)\n\nNow, as much as we want to kvell over Dolgopyat, we must mention that he is only half Jewish, on his father's side. Are we going to nitpick that? Absolutely not!\n\nInstead, let's lament about the Jewish lack of medals in, let's say... archery.\n\nWho knows, maybe that will work out in four three years?\n\n(Editor's update, August 3, 2024: Dolgopyat added a silver in Paris!)",
