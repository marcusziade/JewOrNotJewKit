  "description": "We Jews are good with words. We'll live up to that stereotype.\n\nFor example, did you know that a Jew created \"cold war\"?\n\nYes, you read that right. No, a Jew did not create THE Cold War. Confused yet?\n\nJournalist Walter Lippmann created the term, \"cold war\", coining it in his 1947 book... aptly named \"The Cold War\". It only explained the world for the better half of the past century.\n\nLippmann, who has been called \"the father of modern journalism\" and the \"most influential journalist of the 20th century\" had another, even more important contribution to the lexicon.\n\nHe coined the word \"stereotype\".\n\nTold you Jews are good with words.",
