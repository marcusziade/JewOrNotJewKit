  "description": "Chances are you've never heard of Nicolas Massu.\n\nUnless you're a super-duper tennis fan. Or, y'know, you're Chilean. If you're neither, then you can be forgiven for letting him slip beneath your radar.\n\nMassu is neither awesome nor terrible. He's never won a major tennis tournament. His highest ranking was #9 in the world. Nothing to be ashamed about, certainly. His appearance here for Olympic Week has more to do with his two gold medals in Athens (as of this writing, Chile's first and only golds) than anything expected from him this year (as of this Tuesday, he was eliminated from competition).\n\nActually, there really isn't a lot to say about him. And so, ordinarily, we'd probably just let it go. But Massu's nickname is El Vampiro.\n\nAnd that's just too awesome to ignore.",
