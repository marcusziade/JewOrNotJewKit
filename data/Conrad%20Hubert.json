  "description": "The flashlight was invented by David Misell. Who was Misell? Little is known; he doesn't even have a Wikipedia article. We know that he was born in Britain in 1846 and intended for his invention to be used on a bicycle. He sold his patent to Conrad Hubert, and that was that for David Misell.\n\nConrad Hubert (and, let's face it, there is no name that screams late-19th-century-America more than Conrad Hubert), was not Conrad Hubert at all. He was Akiba Horowitz, a Russian-born immigrant who started a novelty shop with the grandiose name: American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company. Hubert tried to put batteries in everything from neckties to flower pots.\n\nIn 1897, Hubert met Misell, liked his work, and bought it all, including his not-yet-completed prototype, hook line and sinker. Two years later, the patent was issued, and Hubert took it over.\n\nHubert's shop evolved into the Ever Ready Company, as he continued to work on improving the flashlight and furthered his interest in batteries. His company produced the first one to be used inside a telephone (makes a bit more sense than a necktie). Ever Ready eventually became Energizer, which still exists today, and Conrad became a multi-millionaire. As for Misell, all we know is that he died in 1920.\n\nAt least he got mentioned in this profile?",
