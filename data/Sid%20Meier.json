  "description": "Like anything built to last, the nerd platform rests on four solid pillars. \n\nNow, to paraphrase Bill Maher, we're not saying that all nerds are Jewish, but all Jews are nerds. So one would expect to find Jews involved in the construction of each important support piece to the world of nerd-dom. And we do:\n\nNerdy TV shows? Check. Star Trek (Shatner, Nimoy, Lenard), X-Files (Duchovny), Lost (Abrams).\n\nNerdy fiction? Check. Asimov, Sagan, Chabon, Turtledove.\n\n(Nerdy would be redundant) Comics? Duh. Siegal and Shuster, Kane and Finger, Lee and Kirby.\n\nAnd the fourth pillar, of course, is video games in which there are... none?! How did this happen? Oh sure there must be some Jewish programmers out there, but famous ones? Ones whose names you'd know?\n\nUmmmmmm... well there's... what about... yeah, no. Even the ones that sound vaguely Jewish (and the ones we'd really really really really want) like the great Sid Meier are a no go (he's Lutheran).\n\nSigh.\n\nIs this really too much to ask? Can we please get some Jews over on video games before the whole damn structure topples over?",
