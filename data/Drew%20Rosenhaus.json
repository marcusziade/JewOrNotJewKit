  "description": "Drew Rosenhaus is one of the most powerful agents in sports. And does he know how to pick out clients! If you're a big-name NFL player with disciplinary issues (Terrell Owens, Plaxico Burress, Chad Ochocinco, Jeremy Shockey, Donte Stallworth) odds are that Rosenhaus represents you.\n\nAs for the man himself, he is not much better than the people he represents. Drew Rosenhaus is brash, loud, and obnoxious. Drew Rosenhaus was called \"the most hated man in football\" by Sports Illustrated. Drew Ronsehaus always tries to make himself part of a story. Drew Rosenhaus is a prick.\n\nBut Drew Rosenhaus saved a drowning boy's life by administering CPR. \"It was nice to be a good guy for once,\" Rosenhaus said. For once. So how do we reconcile that?\n\nWell, it avoids the \"Sadly, a Jew\" verdict. But just by a hair.",
