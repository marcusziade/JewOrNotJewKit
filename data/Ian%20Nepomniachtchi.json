  "description": "We've waited close to a decade for this, but it has finally happened. A Jew has a chance — a chance is all we've asked for! — to become the World Chess Champion. Yes, the title that was once held by Jew, after Jew, after Jew, can finally return to its rightful origins. There's a major obstacle, of course.\n\nBut first, the challenger: Ian Nepomn.. Nepomnia... they just call him Nepo for short (actually, his name is quite fantastic, it translates to \"one who doesn't remember\"), a Russian Jew who recently won the year-long (interrupted by COVID) tournament for the right to compete for the title. As of this writing, Nepo is the third-rated player in the world, rising steadily after taking gold in the Maccabiah Games of 2009. And, yeah, that haircut.\n\nThe obstacle is Magnus Carlsen, the unstoppable Norwegian machine who has been the World #1 for a decade. He became World Champion in 2013 and has defended the title three times since... but never against a Jew!\n\nSo fingers crossed for Ian... Yeah, even with THAT haircut.\n\n(Editor's update, December 10, 2021: He lost.)",
