  "description": "If you had to guess which one of Hall and Oates is Jewish, you'd go with Oates, right? Just look at Hall's blond pompadour! Have you ever seen a Jew with hair like that?\n\nNo, no, it must be Oates, with that beginner's Jewfro and dark features. It's Oates, right? So why are we profiling Hall?\n\nWell, Oates is not Jewish. His dark complexion comes from goyishe Spanish and Italian roots. Hall, on the other hand, comes from goyishe German stock.\n\nSo, wait, neither is Jewish? This is one confusing profile...\n\nAlright, let's come out and say it: although born Methodist, Hall converted to Judaism for his Jewish wife.\n\nThe wife is long gone, but Hall is still Jewish. And still with Oates...\n\n(Editor's update, 2023: No longer with Oates!?)",
