  "description": "It looks like we've lost our way recently at Jew or Not Jew. When we set out to create this website, our goal was not only to point out who is Jewish and who is not, but specifically to point out hot Jewish chicks.\n\nOh, we were so successful early! Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Sarah Michelle Gellar... But look at our most recent profiles; the best we can do is Christina Aguilera, and she is not that close to being Jewish. Dr. Ruth? Jewish yes, but who would find her hot? Lower your hand, Schlomo. Please.\n\nNot to worry, faithful reader. Today we present Isla Fisher, the Australian actress you might know from \"Wedding Crashers\". Or you might know her as the fiancee of Borat, the very Jewish Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nNo, Isla was not born Jewish. But she converted for Cohen, studying Judaism for three years. And they are not even married yet! The girl is definitely serious.\n\nAnd so are we. Don't worry, faithful reader, we will not try to lose our way anymore. And you too, Schlomo. We'll profile some... hmmmm... older candidates, especially for you. Deal?",
