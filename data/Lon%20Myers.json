  "description": "Currently, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (obviously, Not a Jew) holds the world record in both the 100 and 200 meters. It's a rare feat: running is so specialized, that for an athlete to be the best at two distances is rather extraordinary.\n\nWell, Lon Myers held the world record at ELEVEN different distances. Read 'em and weep, Mr. Bolt.\n\nDuring his career, Myers held every American running record, starting at 50 yards and ending with one mile. His world records ranged from 250 to 1000 yards. And it's not like he was without competition: Myers was part of some epic races with thousands of spectators watching.\n\nAs one story goes, a British runner challenged Myers. Myers won, running a part of the race sideways, laughing into the face of the stupefied Brit. And who says showboating in sport is a recent arrival?\n\nSo does of all of this make Myers the most successful runner of all time? We wouldn't go as far... but it does make him the most successful Jewish runner of all time. It's been 130 years since Myers record-setting days, and no other Jew is even close. Give us a call if you want to convert, Mr. Bolt.",
