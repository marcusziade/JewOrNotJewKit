  "description": "Guy Ritchie was a young, talented, British director. His movies were hip. \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". \"Snatch\". His movies were cool.\n\nAnd then what happened?\n\nMadonna.\n\nInstead of making movies (and we don't count the Madonna-led dreck remake of \"Swept Away\" as one), he followed the Material Girl everywhere she went. To Africa to adopt babies. To the Kabbalah center to pretend to be Jewish.\n\nThen, rumors of their split started to grow. Madonna was shown chatting up Alex Rodriguez. Ritchie went back to his roots and made \"RocknRolla\", which wasn't \"Snatch\", but wasn't \"Swept Away\" either.\n\nAnd now they are splitsville. So two questions linger... will Ritchie continue to pretend to be Jewish with Madonna out of the picture? And, with the Material Girl no longer lingering, will he make cool movies again? We're rather looking forward to that upcoming Sherlock Holmes film, after all.",
