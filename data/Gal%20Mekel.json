  "description": "Can someone explain to us, what's the deal with Israeli first names?\n\nHere we have centuries of Jewish traditions that have given us a plethora of wonderful names. Names so popular that the goyim can't help to steal them. David. Miriam. Jacob. Sarah. Joseph. Rebecca. Herschel. Well, maybe not Herschel.\n\nOver in Israel, and those traditional names are all but gone. Take a look at sultry seductress BAR Rafaeli and basketball player GAL Mekel. Bar is a woman's name? Gal is a man's? Could have fooled us...\n\nGo ahead, goyim. Steal some of these Israeli names. We dare you!",
