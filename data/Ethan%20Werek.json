  "description": "The Winter Olympics kinda have sneaked up on us, haven't they? Didn't we just have the summer ones? Where are these anyway? China? Oh, yeah, that sounds about right.\n\nSurely, these will be the showcases of everything great about China! Can't wait for the glorious show of Chinese sporting achievement! Let's just keep those human rights violations under wraps, right...\n\nWell, here is one sport China is not gonna excel at: hockey. They are only included because they are hosting. So they are stuffing their team with ringers. Some of these are Canadians with Chinese ancestry. Some are players who just happened to play for Kunlun Red Star, a Beijing-based team in Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.\n\nApparently, China fast forwards the naturalization process if you play for its national team, and since Kunlun is the de facto national team, a bunch of Americans and Canadians suddenly became Chinese. One such Canadian is Ethan Werek, who was drafted by the Rangers in 2009, but never made it to the NHL. He bummed around the minors and Europe, before settling with Kulun. And now, the Jewish Werek is a Chinese citizen, free to represent his adopted country at the world's stage.\n\nYep, there is a Jewish Canadian who will play hockey for China at the Olympics.\n\nYou can't make this stuff up.",
