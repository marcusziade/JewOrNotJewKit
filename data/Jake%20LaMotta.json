  "description": "\"Raging Bull\" is considered one of the best sports movies of all time. Robert De Niro's portrayal of boxer Jake LaMotta is often listed as one of the greatest roles in cinema history.\n\nJake, birth name Giacobbe, is obviously Italian. However, there is some confusion about the origins of his mother. She definitely was from Italy, but it's not clear if she was from Trieste or Sicily. More importantly for our purposes, there are claims that she was Jewish, but there is no real proof.\n\nBut we're not gonna dwell on Jake's potentially Jewish mother, for there is something else out there. LaMotta was married six times — to five women — four of whom are purported to be Jewish.\n\nWe hope to G-d that the above is false. Can you imagine it? One Jewish wife is possible to handle, two perhaps. But three? Four, one of them twice? What on earth was he thinking?\n\nWe don't even want to imagine that movie.",
