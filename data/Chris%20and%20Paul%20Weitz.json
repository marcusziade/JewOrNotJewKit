  "description": "Director brothers Chris and Paul Weitz (3/4 Jewish, despite the Chris) rose to prominence after co-directing that 90s classic, \"American Pie\". (Chris is not credited officially, but whatever.) They also worked together on the Chris Rock vehicle \"Down to Earth\" and the critically-acclaimed \"About a Boy\", but their paths diverged from there. So which Weitz has had the better directing career?\n\nChris directed \"The Golden Compass\", which killed the franchise at launch, as well as one of the Twilight movies. (Does it matter which one?)\n\nPaul's best-known solo work is probably \"Little Fockers\", the second sequel to \"Meet the Parents\". It's either that, or \"Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant\". We'll go with the Fockers.\n\nSo... neither?",
