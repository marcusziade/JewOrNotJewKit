  "description": "Truthiness: something one claims to know intuitively without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or actual facts.\n\nSo what happens when Colbert, on his show, gets his DNA examined and the researcher proclaims that there is 3/4 chance that Stephen has Jewish ancestry? Colbert cuts him off without ever finding the truth.\n\nBut we don't need the truth, when we got your truthiness right here, Stephen. Let JONJ be the first website to proclaim that Stephen Colbert, Irish Catholic, the youngest of 11 children, is really a Jew. Who needs evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or actual facts? This is not what truthiness is all about! The 3/4 chance that Colbert's great-great-great-great-great-grandfather might have been a Jew? Good enough for us.\n\nStephen Colbert: Higher Jew Score than Jesus.\n\nAh, who are we kidding.",
