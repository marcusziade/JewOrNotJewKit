  "description": "The author of \"Don Quixote\", the father of Western literature, a Jew? Maybe?...\n\nSupposedly, Miguel de Cervantes did have some Jewish blood; a descendant of marranos, Jews in Spain who were forced to convert but kept their traditions. Well, at least some scholars think so. And who are we to argue with scholars?\n\nAnd then, other scholars believe that Cervantes was a crypto-Jew himself, practicing Jewish traditions in secret. Was he? Who knows... But who are we to argue with scholars?\n\nThe author of \"Don Quixote\", the father of Western literature, a Crypto-Jew? Possible?... Alas, there is no real proof...\n\nWhy are we arguing with scholars?",
