  "description": "We were recently asked to name the most famous person with both Jewish and Asian backgrounds. After digging through our 1500 profiles, we came up with the following options:\n\nMark-Paul Gosselaar, part Jewish, part Indonesian\nPhoebe Cates, part Jewish, part Chinese/Filipino\nRob Schneider, part Jewish, part Filipino\nBruno Mars, part Jewish, part... Filipino. Really?\n\nYes, the Hawaii-born Mars, real name Peter Hernandez, is a quarter Puerto Rican, a quarter Hungarian/Ukrainian Jewish, and half, yes, Filipino, with some Spanish mixed in there... But this list sure raises all kinds of questions about Jews and Filipinos, doesn't it? Honestly, we'd rather not dig into those, we just want to figure out the most famous Asian Jew.\n\nWhich would be Phoebe Cates.\n\nOh, sure, Mars might be on the top of the music world now, but we're willing to bet that in a few years he'll be forgotten.\n\nCates? Nothing will be able to whitewash THOSE from our memory...",
