  "description": "If this was HispanicOrNotHispanic.com, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos would make an excellent profile. Yes, he is often referred to as Hispanic, but the link comes from his Cuban stepfather.\n\nBut this is not HispanicOrNotHispanic.com...\n\nIf this was ScandinavianOrNotScandinavian.com, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos would make an excellent profile. You see, despite the non-nordic last name, he is Scandinavian! His birth father, a star unicyclist(!), was named Jorgensen.\n\nBut this is not ScandinavianOrNotScandinavian.com...\n\nThis is JewOrNotJew.com, of course! And we're not sure if Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos would make an excellent profile on this website...\n\nBut enough people are asking!",
