  "description": "We rarely give out the perfect 15/15 Jew Score; it takes a lot to earn one. Cure polio, for instance. Or develop the theory of structure of space and time. Or direct \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\".\n\nIt's a special club, and we like to keep it so. Currently, we have 13 profiles that score 13/15. There are nine profiles that got 14/15. Only six have achieved that perfect score.\n\nWell, make that seven. Yet, unlike the first six, few probably heard of Janusz Korczak.\n\nSo who was Janusz Korczak? The Polish doctor and writer, born Henryk Goldszmit, is famous throughout Europe for his novels about Macius, the boy king. But those books alone, as brilliant as they might be, would not give Korczak JONJ perfection.\n\nIn charge of a Jewish orphanage in Warsaw during World War II, Korczak was offered to leave to safety. He wouldn't; he wanted to stay with the children. He was offered to leave again and again, even as the orphans were being transferred to an extermination camp. Korczak stayed with them. He stayed with them through the end.\n\nGiving him the perfect score is the least we could do.",
