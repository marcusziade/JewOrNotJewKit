  "description": "Norman Joseph Woodland's invention is everywhere.\n\nIt's on toys and tools, gum and guitars, books and bacon. We are willing to bet that pretty much everything you own had come in contact with Woodland's invention.\n\nWe see it every day, but we usually don't give it a second thought. In fact, we often try to ignore it. And yet, Woodland's invention is incredibly useful. It looks simple, but it's incredibly complex. And it saves time and money for billions of people.\n\nBar codes. Together with Bernard Silver, Norman Joseph Woodland invented bar codes.\n\nTold you: it's everywhere!",
