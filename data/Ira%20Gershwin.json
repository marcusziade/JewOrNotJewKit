  "description": "Four years ago, we wrote our 1000th profile. What an occasion it was! What a hard, rigorous process we went through to select the subject of that profile! George Gershwin, a Jewish legend, a perfect score!\n\nNow we're at profile #2000. Who do we select for such an honor?\n\nHere's an idea: what about George's brother Ira? The two collaborated together on numerous projects, on Broadway and beyond. Ira continued to be prolific even after George's death. Let's it keep it in the family!\n\nOne problem: what are we going to do for profile #3000? Well, George and Ira had another brother, Arthur, a composer in his own right, be he lesser known...\n\n#4000? Their sister Frances, a singer?\n\n#5000??? Ummm... Let's deal with it when we get there.",
