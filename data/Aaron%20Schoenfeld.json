  "description": "When Aaron Schoenfeld played in Major League Soccer, our chances of profiling him were close to nil; and that is with our love for soccer, Jews, and soccer Jews. Schoenfeld was a backup at best, a forward who never scored, someone who spent a season on loan to a minor league club. We love MLS, despite the lack of quality of some of its players. Schoenfeld was one such player.\n\nAnd now... look at Aaron Schoenfeld! Profiled on our website! All because he took a chance and went to Israel.\n\nEarlier this year, Schoenfeld signed with Maccabi Netanya. His early performances turned heads and started a bidding war between major Tel Aviv clubs, Maccabi and Hapoel. Schoenfeld chose Hapoel, and, on his debut against archrival Maccabi, scored two minutes in. He immediately became a club hero, and just kept scoring and scoring.\n\nHow much do Israelis (at least Hapoel fans) love Schoenfeld? He is close to getting called up to the Israel national team, as soon as he gets aliyah because of his Jewish father.\n\nLet that be a lesson to us all: if you're stuck in a middling job with little chance for success, be bold and make a change.\n\nRight?",
