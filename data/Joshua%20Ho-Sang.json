  "description": "Sport drafts are far from a perfect science. Numerous hot prospects flame out, while unheralded athletes turn into gems.\n\nSometimes, someone highly regarded slides down the draft because of off-the-field issues. Such as the case of Jewish hockey player Joshua Ho-Sang...\n\nYes, that's right. JEWISH HOCKEY player Joshua HO-SANG. Jamaican black father, Chilean Jewish mother, Chinese last name... \"My dad's grandfather was from Hong Kong,\" he explains. \"I think that's part of my culture that I've lost a little bit. But we go out for Chinese food.\" On Christmas, we hope.\n\nIn any case, Joshua was a star on the youth level. He is also supposedly outspoken, brash, and cocky, which led to him dropping to the bottom of the first round. Who knows, maybe he will become one of those players that teams will regret to have passed on...\n\nOh. He was taken by the sorriest franchise in all of sport, the New York Islanders. Good luck with that, Joshua.",
