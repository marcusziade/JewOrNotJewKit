  "description": "Emma Stone is clearly goyishe, so to profile her, we'll need a good reason. Let's find it!\n\nShe's Woody Allen's recent shiksa goddess, but that's neither here not there...\n\nShe dated Andrew Garfield for a while, he's Jewish, but it's not like he put a ring on that finger... (Why not, Andrew?)\n\nOh! Perhaps there is a name change? Could Emma Stone really be... Emma Stein?\n\nClose, but no cigar. Originally, \"Stone\" was Swedish \"Sten\", not German/Jewish \"Stein\".\n\nOn second thought... Do we really need a good reason to profile Emma Stone?",
