  "description": "Oh, Poland! Once at the forefront of Eastern Europe's democratic movement, now descending into a fascist spiral.\n\nPoland's ruling party is Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc, which translates to \"Law and Justice\". It is exactly what it sounds like: right-wing, national-conservative, xenophobic, drawing most of its support from uneducated rural areas (wait, why does that sound familiar?), with all the stands on social issues (abortion, gay rights, refugees, etc) that one would expect. In charge of Law and Justice is Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who might not be the most out-there member of his party, but still.\n\nMorawiecki has also been reported to have Jewish ancestry (highly unlikely), or have Jewish aunts, or have family members who live in Israel, or have Jewish family friends, which is neither here nor there. Like most of his his country and his party, Morawiecki is Catholic.\n\nThree years ago, Morawiecki made a comment that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were not only German and Polish, but also Russian, Ukrainian, and (gasp!) Jewish...\n\nOh, Poland!",
