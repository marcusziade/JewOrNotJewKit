  "description": "The Oscar nominees for 2011 have recently been revealed, and the director list is full of Hollywood's brightest. Woody! Marty! Malick! Spiel... Wait, what, no Spielberg?\n\nHaza... what-icius?\n\nThat's Hazanavicius, Michel Hazanavicius, the French director whose almost-silent, black-and-white movie \"The Artist\" is sweeping awards on both sides of the Atlantic. The film has perched many critics' top ten lists and is purported to be a revered take on Hollywood's silent era. And it has an adorable dog.\n\nAnd what do you know, the director a Jew, his grandparents immigrating to France from Lithuania and Poland.\n\nSo are we rooting for Haza... for Michel?\n\nWell, no. We're rooting for Woody. We've actually seen his film. Duh.",
