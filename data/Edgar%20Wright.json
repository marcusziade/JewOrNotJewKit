  "description": "We're big fans of Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy, which might just be the best British movies of the 21st century. (What? You're gonna go with token award dreck like \"The Favourite\" or \"The King's Speech\"? Please!)\n\nWe're sure that the majority of readers got confused by the opening sentence. Who the hell is Edgar Wright? And what the hell is a Cornetto?\n\nIf you haven't heard of Wright, you might have heard of his collaborators: Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the stars of Wright-directed \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Hot Fuzz\", and \"The World's End\". Those three films make up the Cornetto trilogy.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Cornetto, it's a brand of an ice cream cone favoured in Britain, topped with chocolate and nuts. The trilogy's movies have no connection to each other (the actors play different roles), but each has a fleeting reference to the treat.\n\nAs for Wright himself, he's 1/32 Jewish (because ultimately that's what we're here for, aren't we?), and is also known for writing \"Ant-Man\" and directing \"Scott Pilgrim vs the World\" and \"Baby Driver\".\n\nThose are not bad, but will not make our best movies list, British or otherwise...",
