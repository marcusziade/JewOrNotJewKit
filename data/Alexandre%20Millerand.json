  "description": "We love finding obscure things on the world map named after Jews, and today is no exception. To find this location, you need to go south to the very tip of South America. Then go south again. You'll hit that protruding peninsula of Antarctica, but don't stop there. Keep going south!\n\nFinally, you'll reach Millerand Island, measuring six kilometers in length and six kilometers in width. It was discovered in 1910 by French explorer (and Olympic sailing medalist!) Jean-Baptiste Charcot and named after Alexandre Millerand, who, at the time, was France's Minister of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs. Charcot must have been a big fan of the post office...\n\nIn a few years, Millerand became France's Minister of War (just in time for World War I), and then rose all the way to president, serving from 1920 to 1924. But while Millerand was born a Jew, he was baptized early on and is buried under a cross, so we can't fully claim him... or his namesake island.\n\nWhat's on Millerand Island? Not much at all! This uninhabited square of ice has one building: a red hut. Apparently, they keep some food and fuel there, enough to last for two weeks... Which should come in handy for those who took on the ridiculous journey we described in the opening paragraph!",
