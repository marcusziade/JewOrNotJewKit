  "description": "Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century, was born into a large family. His parents were Austrian Jews whose families converted to Christianity.\n\nLudwig's father, Karl, a steel tycoon, was one of the richest people in Europe. He had nine children. Ludwig, the youngest, was the most distinguished of them all, but brother Paul was a renowned pianist. Sister Margaret was subject of a famous portrait by Gustav Klimt. And then there were the other brothers, Hans, Kurt, and Rudi.\n\nAll of them committed suicide. In fact, both surviving brothers, Paul and Ludwig, went through life often contemplating ending it.\n\nWhy all the morbidness? Apparently, Karl was so heavy-handed, and their mother so weak-willed, that no matter what the children did, they weren't good enough. Hans was a musical prodigy, Ludwig was obviously brilliant... none of it mattered. The children didn't want to go into the family business. Karl was forever displeased.\n\nBe open-minded, dear parents.",
