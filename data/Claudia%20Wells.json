  "description": "\"And we're going to eliminate Marty's girlfriend Jennifer Parker, since she's a prototypical California blonde (not saying it's IMPOSSIBLE for her to be Jewish, just quite unlikely).\" â€” Jew or Not Jew, 2011\n\nOh, Jew or Not Jew, Jew or Not Jew, Jew or Not Jew! How young and oblivious you were ten years ago! (Pssst... there is a pandemic coming. You better stock up on toilet paper!) You were talking about Elisabeth Shue as Jennifer Parker, weren't you? How could you forget Claudia Wells?\n\nIt seems that the whole world forgot Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in the original BTTF before disappearing off the face of the Earth (or getting unstuck in the space-time continuum?) Wells has to drop out of the sequels to take care of her ailing mother. Shue took over, cementing her role as high school queen of the 1980s.\n\nBut did you know that Wells wasn't even the first actress to play Jennifer? That was Melora Hardin, now better known as Jan Levinson(-Gould) from The Office. Hardin even filmed scenes, but was fired when she was deemed too tall for Michael J. Fox.\n\nWell, Shue: obviously not a Jew. Hardin: obviously not a Jew. Wells: used to be a Jew... but became a born-again Christian. So Jew or Not Jew from ten years ago was right after all?",
