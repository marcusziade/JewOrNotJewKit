Nathan \"Kid Dropper\" Kaplan. Jacob \"Gurrah\" Shapiro. Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter. \"Dutch\" Schultz. Abe \"Kid Twist\" Reles. And, of course, Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, who, for all his illegal activity, was a pioneer in developing Las Vegas (although we are not sure if that's good or bad).\n\nNo, it's not enough to start their own category, but we're glad to diversify our website even more.
