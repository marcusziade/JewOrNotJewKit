  "description": "Today, on JONJ's Issues With The Bible:\n\nMoses lived to be 120 years old. Abraham, 175. Terah, 205. Enoch, 365. Shem, 600. Methuselah, 969.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nRemember, in the olden days (say, in the 17th century), people were considered lucky if they survived past 40. Fine, let's say 120 is an outlier, we'll give Moses that, he deserves it. The other ones, especially 969? Get the fuck out.\n\nHere's our theory: they missed a decimal point. Decimals haven't been invented yet, so how could they transcribe that in the Bible? In reality, Methuselah lived to be 96.9 years old... which will still make him really old for those times, but at least it's somewhat believable. He was said to be 187 at the time of his son's birth: make that 18.7. See, it adds up!\n\nNext time, on JONJ's Issues With The Bible:\n\nHow hard did they have to blow on those trumpets to bring down the walls of Jericho?\n\nStay tuned...",
