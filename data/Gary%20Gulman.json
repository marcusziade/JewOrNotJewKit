  "description": "We really enjoy the comedy of Gary Gulman, one of the sharpest stand-ups working today. He always brings his Jewishness into the act... One of the reasons we like him, of course.\n\nSo we've been watching Gulman clips on YouTube, when we encountered a terrific bit titled \"The hypocrisy of bigotry\", where Gary states that those who hate Jews shouldn't use things invented by Jews: the cure for polio (check). The remote control (check). The contraception pill (check). Color television (NOT check)?\n\nIf \"who invented television?\" doesn't have a clear answer (we dealt with that in the Boris Rosing profile), \"who invented color television?\" is also not an open-and-shut case. Most give credit to John Logie Baird, who demonstrated mechanical color TV in 1928. Then there is Guillermo Gonzalez Camarena, who invented the color-wheel system in the late 1930s. Neither was Jewish.\n\nOur best guess is that Gary is referring to Hungarian-American inventor Peter Goldmark, whose version came out about the same time as Gonzalez Camarena's, but eventually won out as the de facto standard. In fact, we explained it in Goldmark's profile, handily linked below.\n\nSo, Gary, you're well known for refining your act... Perhaps in the future, you can replace \"color television\" by one of the numerous other Jewish inventions? Aspirin, teddy bears, the ballpoint pen... oh, the cell phone!\n\nGood luck not using that, antisemites!",
