Rest in Internet peace, you galaxy of fame!)\n\nSo, yeah, that guy. With the very, very distinctive face, to say the least. THAT guy! He recently appeared in a key role in a very important episode of \"Succession\". What was his name again? What have we seen him in? Apparently, he is Jewish? And British, right? \n\nRight. THAT guy is British character actor Adam Godley, who has been in... well, many, many things, but never in a starring role. (Unless you count \"Fallet\", a Swedish spoof of Nordic noir. We're not going to count \"Fallet\".) And when you see him, you know it's him, with that unmistakable face!\n\nTurns out we watched him for three seasons on \"The Great\" and did not recognize him. Thirty episodes in a rather important role, and... nope. No idea that Archbishop Archie was... THAT guy.\n\nfunction loadPic() {\nswapPic('a/adam_godley', 'godley');\n}",
