  "description": "Jewish children are never named after parents... it's bad luck. (We know, we know, some Sephardic Jews do it anyway!) There is one rather solemn exception. Jewish children are sometimes named after dead parents.\n\nHere we have Zigfrids Anna Meierovics, the Prime Minister of Latvia in the 1920s. (Remember, the Baltic states were briefly independent between the Russian revolution and World War II.) Mierovics, who was Jewish on his father's side, was named after... his mother. That middle name was a dead giveaway! (No pun intended. Alright, terrible pun wholly intended...)\n\nMeierovics' mother died in childbirth, and, sadly, this profile is not getting any happier. He himself was killed at the age of 38 in a car accident, together with his ex-wife (also named Anna...) and children. A few months later, his second wife (Kristine, not Anna) committed suicide.\n\nThere's bad luck, and then there is Zigfrids Anna Meierovics.",
