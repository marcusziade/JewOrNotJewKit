  "description": "What is the worst advertising slogan of all time? \n\nCoca-Cola's \"Great National Temperance Beverage\" (1906) comes to mind. Or how about Dr. Pepper as \"America's Most Misunderstood Soft Drink.\" For something of a more recent vintage, there's always Ford: \"Drive One.\" We don't have inside information, but we're willing to bet Drive One was chosen on a Friday at roughly 4:55pm.\n\nHowever, as bad as they can get, we've gotta give the prize to the Sara Lee folks (famous for their frozen bakery treats) and their tremendous tagline: \"Nobody Doesn't Like Sara Lee.\"\n\nFirst of all, there's a huge misunderstanding factor here. Half the time, it sounds like Nobody does IT like Sara Lee, which sorta makes sense. It's also at least a little dirty, but even the best slogans have that problem (Nike's \"Just Do It\". McD's \"I'm Lovin' It\". Let's just move on.). \n\nNo, the real issue is when you hear the slogan correctly, it's somehow worse. The whole thing is one big double negative.  What the hell does Nobody Doesn't Like even mean? \n\nIt hardly matters, anyway. The Sara Lee brand (after being passed around the corporate table a few times) has been consumed by the Hillshire Farms people who've changed the slogan to \"the joy of eating\" which... well at least there's nothing ambiguous there.\n\nPerhaps the old slogan makes more sense now that we know Sara Lee was started by a Jew, Charles Lubin, who named the company for his daughter. After all, Nobody Doesn't Like the Jewish People!\n\nOh wait...",
