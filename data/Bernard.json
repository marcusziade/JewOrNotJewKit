  "description": "What's the best thing about watching World Cup in high definition? It's the little things. And we're not talking about the nuances on the field.\n\nFor example, as Brazil was ready to face Chile in a penalty shoot-out, we noticed their player #20. Not because he stood out; in fact, he was a good head shorter than his teammates. It was because of his Star of David tattoo!\n\nWho is this #20? Could he be...? Turns out that his name is Bernard, and he is not only Brazil's shortest player, but also its youngest. Alas, there is absolutely no evidence that he is Jewish... just another example of a goy borrowing Jewish symbolism. Oh well.\n\nWhat's the worst thing about watching World Cup in high definition? The Greek coach's nose hair.\n\np1 = document.getElementById(\"pic1\");\np2 = document.getElementById(\"pic2\");\nfunction show(x) {\n i1 = p1; i2 = p2;\n if (x == 2) {\n   i1 = p2; i2 = p1;\n }\n i2.style.display = 'none';\n i1.style.display = 'inline';\n}",
