  "description": "We get quite a few complaints that people who have Jewish heritage, but do not practice Judaism, should not be considered Jews. We used to respond, and try to plead our case, but everyone has their own definition of \"Jew\". Which is kinda the point of our website. So we stopped replying.\n\nToday's profilee, Carl Reiner, he of the long-time Mel Brooks partnership (2000 Year Old Man!), definitely has Jewish heritage. His parents were European Jewish immigrants who settled in the Bronx. But as Carl got older, the Jewish religious roots didn't stick. He now considers himself an atheist.\n\n\"I have a very different take on who God is,\" Reiner explains. \"Man invented God because he needed him. God is us.\"\n\nSo does that stop Carl from being Jewish? To some, it might. But to us, it's just another twist on the definition of \"God\". Which is kinda the point. So to us, only one verdict is possible. Don't expect a response, complainers.",
