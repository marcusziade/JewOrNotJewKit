  "description": "\"It's even worse in Physics, where just two out of 200 winners were women, and the last one of those was in 1963. And none of them were Jewish...\"  â€” Jew or Not Jew, 2016\n\nIt turns out we weren't exactly right. The non-Marie Curie Nobel Physics female laureate, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, was actually a quarter Jewish! She won the prize in 1963 for the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus.\n\nGoeppert-Mayer was one of the few women who participated on the Manhattan Project, closely working with Edward Teller. Her calculations were used in creating the hydrogen bomb... err... that nuclear shell model sounds important, doesn't it? \n\nThat Jewish revision aside, it looks like another amendment is needed to the statement above. It only took 55 years, but the Nobel committee, in all its chauvinist glory, has awarded the 2018 Physics Prize to an actual woman: Donna Strickland! (She shared it with two men, natch, including the previously-profiled Arthur Ashkin.) Good job, Nobels, that's three out of 209! Talk about a a forward-thinking organization...\n\n(Editor's update, October 6, 2020: Now four female laureates, with Andrea Ghez joining. It's a start...)",
