Salinger, who narrowly edged out Stan Lee for the oldest living profilee. Are we sure J.D. is still alive? He is? Don't worry, Stan, there's always next year...\n\nAnd now, the nominees for Most Surprising Person with Jewish Heritage: musician Billy Joel... Singer and dancer Paula Abdul... News anchor Katie Couric... And the Italian Stallion, Sylvester Stallone!\n\nAnd the winner is... Gosh, can you feel the excitement? It's Sylvester Stallone! \n\nWhat's that, Sly?

Say hello to that long lost Jewish grandmother for us, please.\n\nComing up next: the eagerly awaited Best Beard category...",
