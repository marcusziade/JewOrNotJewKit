  "description": "Let's say you're vacationing in Aruba, and you're bored of all the beaches and the water and the sun and the bikinis and you say to yourself, I'd like some culture! So you hop on a tour bus and ride around the island.\n\n\"Who is that statue of?\", you ask, as the bus takes you through the streets of Oranjestad. \"Well, that's Henny Eman,\" the helpful tour guide answers. \"He helped us to get free of Curacao!\" \"What's wrong with Curacao?\", you want to ask. It seems like a nice place.\n\nAs you ease back into your seat, the tour guide notices your somewhat Semitic complexion, and adds, \"Henny Eman was Jewish!\" \"You don't say,\" you respond. \"Aren't there a total of 100 Jews in all of Aruba?\" \"Only 85, actually. And Eman was one of them. And you know who is another? The first prime minister of Aruba, Henny Eman! His grandson!\"\n\nAs you think of a way to end the conversation, the tour guide continues. \"Aruba's current prime minister was Jewish as well! No, not Henny Eman... Mike Eman, his brother!\" You nod, and bury your head in a book, blaming yourself for asking the question in the first place.\n\nAnd no, the above didn't happen to us. You actually think that if we ever were in Aruba, we'd ever get bored of the beaches and the water and the sun and the bikinis?\n\nPlease.",
