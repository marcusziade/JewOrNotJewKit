  "description": "The best American tennis player right now...\n\nErr, make that the best American male tennis player right now is this guy, Taylor Fritz. As of this writing, he is ranked 5th in the world, despite never making it past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event. It might sound like a stretch, but who are we to argue with formulas?\n\nSo, yeah, this guy, Taylor Fritz, despite having the most goyishe last name possible (Seriously, does it get more German than \"Fritz\"?), does, in fact, have Jewish heritage. His mother, Kathy May, is the great-granddaughter of David May, who founded a department store chain (how Jewish of him) that eventually merged with Macy's.\n\nKathy was a quality tennis player in her own right, ranking as high as #10 in the world, despite never making it past Grand Slam quarterfinals. She was once married to Brian Teacher, who was once ranked as high as 7th, and actually won a Grand Slam title: the 1980 Australian Open!\n\nOh, and Teacher is Jewish, making the Teacher-May-Fritzes a rather awkwardly-related, somewhat Jewy, American tennis royalty!\n\nThat's a stretch, we'll give you that.",
