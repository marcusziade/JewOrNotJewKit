  "description": "Bernie Sanders lost to a woman. Again.\n\nYes, this is not the first time the venerable Vermont socialist had his ambition stifled by a female. Back in 1986, he had gubernatorial aspirations, but they were easily thwarted by Madeleine Kunin. The vote wasn't even close.\n\nKunin was a trailblazer in her own right: she was the first ever Jewish female governor. (Alright, maybe the trail she blazed hasn't exactly been well-traveled. There have only been two, Kunin and notorious Christmas denier Linda Lingle. We kid, Linda.) Kunin became the first woman to be elected governor three times, before deciding to step away in 1990. She followed up by being named US ambassador to Switzerland, her native land.\n\nKunin has continued to be active in retirement, especially in the areas of women's rights and the environment. Oh, and in this year's election, she supported Hillary.\n\nSorry, Bernie.",
