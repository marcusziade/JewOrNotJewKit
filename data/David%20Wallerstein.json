  "description": "Hey, America!\n\nYes, we're talking to you.\n\nLook at yourself in the mirror, America. You are bloated. Obese. Corpulent. Gargantuan. F, A, T, fat!\n\nWe are sorry for being so blunt, America, but you did it to yourself. Oh, sure, you can blame others, be it food companies or fast food franchises, but the finger is pointed straight at you.\n\nYes, those fast food franchises are such an easy target! It's not your fault that they made the food so cheap and so delicious! It's not your fault that super-sizing so accessible! (Actually, you're partially right there. The reason super-sizing exists is because of a rather brilliant sales tactic developed for McDonald's by David Wallerstein in the 70s. But you are to blame for following up on it.)\n\nShape up, America. Drop the burgers and the fries. Say no to a second serving. Stop drenching yourself in the special sauce. And, you know, once in a while, take a walk. Go up a flight of stairs. And quit blaming others!\n\nIt's not too much to ask, is it?",
