Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, my family just moved to Milwaukee. I'm the only Jewish girl in my school! The boys here are only interested in beer, blonds, and boobs, and I don't exactly look like Pamela Anderson. What should I do??? â€” Deborah Schneider-Hymowitz, 16, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nDear Deborah,\n\nBelieve it or not, you're not the first Jewish girl to move to Milwaukee. 100 years ago, a young Golda Mabovitch (not exactly a Pamela Anderson look-alike herself) was facing the same predicament. And she turned out just fine. \n\nSo perhaps you should forget about those Wisconsin boys and go into politics.\n\nOr just wait until college.\n\nKeep your chin up,\n\nJew or Not Jew.",
