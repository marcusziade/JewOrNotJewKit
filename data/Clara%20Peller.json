  "description": "There were lots of important questions in the 1980s.\n\nWhy is the economy so bad?\n\nIf the economy is so bad, why is it there are all these happy, young, rich Republicans?\n\nWhy is our government so corrupt?\n\nWill American cities ever recover?\n\nWill the Russians blow us up? Will we blow up the Russians? Will Iran blow up all of us?\n\nBut in the minds of the public, there was only one:\n\nWhere's the beef?\n\nThat was the question being asked by the Jewish Clara Peller, playing an old woman who had grown dissatisfied with the protein content of her usual fast food fare and demanded the kind of meaty goodness that only the fine folks at Wendy's could provide.\n\nYes, as government scandals multiplied, terrorism rose, and the economy dropped through the floor, the entire country was captivated by this crotchety bubbe (who really should have been ordering her burger without cheese) requesting — nay, demanding! — that her insatiable cravings for fried ground beef be fulfilled.\n\nG-d, the 80s were stupid.",
