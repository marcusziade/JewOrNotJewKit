  "description": "According to the Intertubes, Helen Reddy is nicknamed \"The Singing Nun\". That seems strange.\n\nReddy is quite the feminist icon. She is best known for \"I Am Woman\", the chart-topping anthem of the early 1970s. So, the \"singing\" part is obvious. \"Nun\", not so much.\n\nWe're pretty sure that Reddy has never been a nun. Heck, she has been married three times. She even converted to Judaism upon marrying her second husband, which is as far from nun as one can get.\n\nLet's turn to the Intertubes for some help. It turns out that Reddy played Sister Ruth, the singing nun, in the film \"Airport 1975\". (The film is supposedly one of the worst movies ever made, but it gave much fodder for \"Airplane!\", so we'll let it slide.)\n\nSo that explains that. Still, we don't see how that became her nickname after one minor movie role. Can you explain, Intertubes?",
