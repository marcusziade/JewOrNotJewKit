  "description": "Originally, we were going to profile Sherlock Holmes' arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty. However, once we revisited the books, we remember that he is pretty much a non-entity.\n\nAs the story goes, Arthur Conan Doyle got tired of Holmes, so he introduced Moriarty to kill him off. The so-called \"Napoleon of Crime\" appears in one and only one story, \"The Final Problem\", where he and Holmes famously battle atop a waterfall. Both fall to their death â€” of course, Holmes recovered when Doyle decided to give his detective another go. Moriarty is never heard from again.\n\nInterestingly, Doyle pulled the Napoleon moniker from real-life criminal Adam Worth, who was given that nickname by a Scotland Yard detective. Worth had a criminal career that spanned three continents (he started in America and also had a run in South Africa). In England, he created a criminal empire, masterminding robberies. His most famous theft was of \"Georgiana\", a painting by Thomas Gainsborough. Worth was eventually captured, so there was no battle on the waterfall. Alas.\n\nAnd what do you know, Worth was Jewish! By extension, we could claim that Moriarty was Jewish as well... Which we would, if he wasn't such a non-entity.",
