  "description": "We're a little disappointed in Kat Dennings.\n\nKat Dennings? Who? Apparently, she stars in some TV show called \"2 Broke Girls\". Was in some movie with Micheal Cera, got her start at a young age on \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Sex in the City\". And she's a very good-looking girl, sure.\n\nA very good-looking Jewish girl, at that. So how did she get such a goyishe last name? Maybe her father isn't Jewish?\n\nNo. In fact, Kat is Jewish on both sides. She even calls her ethnicity \"a billion percent Jewish\". But she didn't like the name she was born with, Katherine Litwack. \"It's a little hideous,\" she says about it.\n\nIf you can picture us, dear readers, we're currently shaking our head in disappointment.\n\nBut yes, she's a good-looking girl. We'll give her that.",
