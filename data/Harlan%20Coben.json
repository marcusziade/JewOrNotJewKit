  "description": "You know what we love about Netflix? No, this is not gonna be one of those profiles where we review a Netflix show... Have we become so predictable?\n\nWe love that the world's television is at our fingertips. While a few years ago we had no choice but to limit ourselves to the best American cable had to offer, we now have the chance to sample something from every corner of the globe. And if we don't like it? The next show is just a click away.\n\nWe especially enjoy England's various mystery offerings. There's something about a brooding English cop that hits the spot just right. (David Tennant FTW!) Our most recent watch was \"The Stranger\", a show created by and based on the book by Harlan Coben. Even though he is a Jew from New Jersey (and one of America's most popular mystery writers), he has gone off to Europe to create TV series in various countries. Interestingly, even though the novel takes place in Coben's home state, the show was transposed to England. Maybe those Brits couldn't handle Jersey accents?\n\nSo, what did we think about \"The Stranger\"? Do you really want this to become one of THOSE profiles?",
