  "description": "As the adage goes, second place is first loser. They put it on t-shirts and everything.\n\nAnd, as stupid as it sounds, in the world of sport, it's often true. Just ask Buffalo Bills fans.\n\nOften, but not always. Take the case of Yael Arad.\n\nFrom Israel's first Olympic participation in 1952, and for 40 years, the country failed to win a medal. That all changed in the Barcelona games in 1992, when Arad took the silver in judo. She immediately became a hero, to Israelis and Jews all over the world.\n\nSo, clearly, in Arad's case, second place is first winner.\n\nWe're just not sure how that would look on a t-shirt.",
