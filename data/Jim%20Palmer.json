  "description": "For those too young to remember, aka anyone of an age to be utilizing the Internet and thus reading this profile, Jim Palmer was an ace pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles back in their heyday from the late 60s to the early 80s. He pitched a no-hitter in 1969, won three Cy Young awards, was a first ballot Hall of Famer, and is generally considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\n\nAnd yet, how close did we come to never seeing him pitch?\n\nPalmer is not Jewish, but he was adopted by a Jewish father shortly after birth. He wanted to be a professional ballplayer, but his father told him it was not something a \"good Jewish boy\" would do. Palmer did it anyway. Thank Hashem.\n\nPerhaps his adoptive father would have preferred Jim be in the garment business. After all, that's what the father himself did. He got his wish in the 1970s when Jim did some forgettable commercials for Jockey-brand underwear, including some on billboards in Times Square featuring him in the product and nothing else (Yikes!).\n\nOr maybe he wanted Jim to be in insurance. That's a good career for a Jewish boy, right? Well Jim did that, as well, when he took over for Phil Rizzuto hawking The Money Store, a campaign that might very well be one of the most embarrassing of all time. (Worse than Crazy Eddie? We vote yes.)\n\nYes, Jim has had several careers, all of which should have been supremely embarrassing except for, y'know, the one thing his Jewish father felt was so shameful.\n\nIs it just us, or do you think that maybe it's time for us to rethink that whole \"things that good Jewish boys do?\"",
