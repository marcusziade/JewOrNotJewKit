  "description": "Let's say — speaking hypothetically here — that you have a relative. It's not a very close one, but a relative nonetheless. That person works for the US government... but don't exactly know what branch of the US government. You think it's __________, but you are not sure. And if you ask, you won't get a response.\n\nThat relative — again, speaking completely hypothetically — speaks fluent _______ and spends a lot of his time out of the country, mostly in ________ and ________. It doesn't mean he is a ______, of course! He could just be a data analyst or something.\n\nWhich brings us to Yakov Serebryansky, who definitely didn't work the the US government (although he did spend some time in the US in a rather different capacity). Serebryansky was a Soviet master spy who organized the so-called \"Uncle Yasha Group\" of mostly Jewish operatives who conducted a bunch illicit Soviet stuff  (assassinations, explosions, what have you) in the 1920s and 30s. The Soviets were such fans of Yasha's work that they arrested him no less than three times, but kept releasing him.\n\nWhat does this have to do with __________? Absolutely nothing, we assure you!\n\n.redacted { color: black; background-color: black; }",
