The dying is hyperbolic, of course.\n\nFor Harry Einstein, it wasn't.\n\nEinstein was one of America's most famous comedians of the first part of the 20th century. Working on Eddie Cantor's and Al Jolson's radio programs, he made millions laugh in the guise of chef Nick Parkyakarkus. (In fact, you can make the case that the obviously Jewish Einstein was America's best-known Greek for a good two decades.)\n\nWhich brings us to 1958, and the comedy roast of Lucy Ball and Desi Arnaz. After performing, Einstein collapsed into the arms of Milton Berle, who screamed, \"Is there a doctor in the house?\" That wasn't a joke. Einstein died two hours later.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Einstein, you might have of his sons: comedians Albert (Brooks) and Bob. A better legacy than dying on stage...",
