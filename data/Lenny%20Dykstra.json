  "description": "After retiring from baseball, Lenny Dykstra's life took a strange turn. He embraced himself in Torah study.\n\nYes, the same Lenny Dykstra who was nicknamed \"Nails\", was never the sharpest tool in the shed, and single-handedly kept the tobacco chew industry going. Torah study. Go figure.\n\nNo, he did not convert to Judaism, but... \"I'm trying to find if God exists. I want to deal with people who are smarter than me.\" So, smart people: Jews.\n\nYep, that's a strange turn... even stranger than his stint as a financial guru, his failed lifestyle magazine, and legal troubles that range from embezzlement to grand theft auto to indecent exposure to holding an Uber driver at gunpoint.\n\nLenny Dykstra is one strange messed-up dude.",
