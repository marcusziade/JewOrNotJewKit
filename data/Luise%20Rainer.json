  "description": "Luise Rainer died recently, but, despite being one of the leading ladies of early Hollywood, few have ever heard of her. Some have called it \"The Oscar Curse\".\n\nThe Jewish, German-born Rainer was the first actor to win multiple Oscars, and did so in consecutive years to boot — in 1936 and 1937. And then... nothing.\n\nIt's as if those two Oscars cursed Rainer for the rest of her life. Be it because she was burned out, because she got bad advice from her husband, because of the death of her producer, or because she was blacklisted by the studios, she stopped acting. She moved to Europe and stayed out of the limelight for seven decades.\n\nRainer died on December 30, 2014, at the age of 104, outliving all of her contemporaries.\n\nPerhaps \"The Oscar Curse\" wasn't that evil after all...",
