  "description": "Ever since we set up the \"See Also\" links under each profile, the discussion of exactly who goes into that list has been heated.\n\nIdeally, we try to select profiles that are somehow related. Here's an example:\n\nBess Myerson, the first (and only?) Jewish Miss America, winning in in 1945. Who would she link to?\n\nThe obvious one is Rina Messinger, the first (and only?) Jewish Miss Universe.\n\nEd Koch, the former mayor of New York. Myerson served as New York City's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs under Koch, and the two were friends (or perhaps more than that?).\n\nAnd Winona Ryder... Why Winona Ryder? Well, in 1988, Myerson was arrested for shoplifting $44.07 in merchandise. Thus proving that though Miss America is a great honor, it's not exactly lucrative (seriously, she couldn't find $44 lying around the house?).\n\nIf only every profile was this easy.\n\nd1 = document.getElementById(\"seeAlsoPic1\");",
