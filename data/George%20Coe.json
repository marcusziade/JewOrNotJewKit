  "description": "Saturday Night Live's recent 50th anniversary special made many look back at the last half-century and run through all the casts. Here at JONJ we wondered, did we miss any important Jewish SNL alumni?\n\nNo, we haven't. We've got them all covered from Gilda Radner to Chloe Fineman. Oh, there are a few missing, but have you ever heard of Matthew Laurence, Jon Rudnitsky, or George Coe?\n\nPerhaps the latter, whose claim to fame is being a member of SNL's first ever cast. Radner! Aykroyd! Chase! Belushi! Coe! Yeah, not much Coe.\n\nCoe, whose real last name was Cohen, was part of SNL's first ever episode. He was mostly a Broadway actor who was hired to be the \"token old guy\". (He was 46. Eh... no comment.) No, he did not exactly leave a mark: Coe was the first ever cast member to get fired... as he was let go after that very first episode.\n\nPerhaps that makes him a tad more important?",
