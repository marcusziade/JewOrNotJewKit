  "description": "Let's say that your last name is Einstein. A fairly common Jewish last name. And let's say you have a son. How would you name that son?\n\nDavid is a good Jewish name. David Einstein. Doesn't sound too bad.\n\nWhat about Michael? Michael Einstein. Not too shabby.\n\nBenjamin Einstein. Samuel Einstein. Or you don't even have to go to the Jewish route. Ryan Einstein! Jayden Einstein! Xavier Einstein!\n\nThere are many many options. And we know one thing: Albert is not among them. As if the kid won't have enough trouble with that last name alone. But \"Albert Einstein\"? It's a bit too much to live up to. It's a bit too much to deal with. You'll need a big sense of humor with that one.\n\nNo wonder Albert Einstein... err... make that Albert Brooks, became a comedian.",
