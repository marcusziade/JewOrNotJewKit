  "description": "There's no movie that we've anticipated more (this includes everything in the Star Wars oeuvre) than Indiana Jones 4. Two decades of waiting led to — fingers in our ears, we can't hear what you are saying — it was alright. We refuse to re-watch it. Yes, it was alright.\n\nNow, another decade has passed, and it looks like Indy 5 is going to see the light of day... at some point. Maybe they can make up for the mistakes of 4? (Didn't we just say it was alright?)\n\n\"They\" would not include Steven Spielberg, who passed the directing reigns to James Mangold. Mangold (self-described \"half Jewish\", for those who keep track of those things) is best known for \"Logan\". He does have a wide range of films in his own oeuvre: \"Ford v Ferrari\", \"Cop Land\", \"Walk the Line\", and somehow both \"Girl, Interrupted\" and \"Kate \u0026 Leopold\". Perhaps someone with such a diverse resume can be trusted to resurrect our favorite franchise?\n\nSay it ain't so! Are we now anticipating Indiana Jones 5?!",
