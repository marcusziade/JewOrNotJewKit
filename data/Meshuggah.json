  "description": "Are we writing about band names again? Yes, we're writing about band names again. It's Meshuggah!\n\nWhat's meshuggah (lower case m)? Well, it's a different spelling of \"meshuga\" (or \"meshugah\"), meaning \"crazy\" or \"mad\" in Yiddish. (We estimate 99.9% of our readers know that one.)\n\nWhat's Meshuggah (upper case m)? Well, for those unfamiliar with Swedish heavy metal (which, we assume, is 99.9% of our readers) it's... a Swedish heavy metal band consisting of men named Jens, Fredrik, Tomas, M\ufffdrten, and, somehow, Dick. None of them are Jewish. Apparently, Jens found \"meshuggah\" in an American street slang dictionary. (Now we must ask, when was this dictionary published for Yiddish to be considered street slang?)\n\nSo, another profile about band names. What did you expect, for us to listen to the actual music?",
