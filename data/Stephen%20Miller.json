  "description": "You know what's not really fair?\n\nA lot of people are making fun of Stephen Miller for going prematurely bald.\n\nLook at him! He is in his early 30s, but looks at least 20 years older. Well, the baldness is not his fault! Blame his genes; no one has a choice there! And while the look is not exactly fetching, at least he eschewed a toupee or a fancy weave like his obviously bald, but obtusely vain boss.\n\nWho is Miller's boss? Unless you are living under a rock, you know him. It's the buffoon-in-chief in charge of our country, and Miller's role is far from blameless. The speechwriter-turned-advisor is responsible for many, if not all, of the current administration's white nationalist policies. Never mind the fact that same policies, if enacted in the past, would have stopped Miller's ancestors from entering this very country.\n\nSo leave the baldness alone. Instead, bash Miller for being a malicious, racist, hate-spewing, close-minded bigot.\n\nThat's all on him.",
