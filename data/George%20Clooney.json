  "description": "As regular readers know, we loathe to profile people who have no connection to anything Jewish. We would rather write about an obscure Jew than a famous goy. But every now and again, we break our own rules. More often than not, it's for a pretty face.\n\nSuch is NOT the case with this profile. George Clooney does have a Jewish connection! Read on.\n\nAs you might have heard, Clooney recently got married. No, his new wife is definitely not Jewish, but note the word \"new\". Clooney was married once before, from 1989 to 1993, to actress Talia Balsam. You can guess where this is going.\n\nTalia's father was Martin Balsam. While he is not exactly well-known now, he did have quite a resume. Balsam won a Best Supporting Actor in 1965, and has a Tony to his name as well. And, yes, Jewish.\n\nSo, if we were to adhere to our own rules, we should profile Balsam and not Clooney. Yet, here we are: the only reason Balsman is even mentioned is to provide a Jewish connection for his once-son-in-law...\n\nIt must be the pretty face.",
