  "description": "US Attorney General William Barr — somehow, Jewish on his father's side, although raised Catholic — clearly has trouble with reading comprehension. Since trying to understand the Special Counsel's reports is clearly too complex, we've asked Mr. Barr to interpret... nursery rhymes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary had a little lamb,\nIts fleece was white as snow;\nEverywhere the child went,\nThe little lamb was sure to go.\n\n\"The investigation did not establish that Mary owned a sheep or coordinated her activities with it.\"\n\n\n\nLittle Jack Horner sat in the corner,\nEating a Christmas pie;\nHe put in his thumb and pulled out a plum,\nAnd said, \"What a good boy am I!\"\n\n\"No conclusion was drawn — one way or the other — as to whether Mr. Horner found fruit inside a pastry.\"\n\n\n\nJack and Jill went up the hill\nTo fetch a pail of water.\nJack fell down and broke his crown\nAnd Jill came tumbling after.\n\n\"There was no evidence of Jack or Jill falling. There was, in fact, no tumbling.\"\n\n\n\nClearly, that didn't help...\n\n\n\n\nshown = new Array(3);\nfunction flip(x) {\nif (x != 1) divHide(\"nr1\");\nif (x != 2) divHide(\"nr2\");\nif (x != 3) divHide(\"nr3\");\ndivShow(\"nr\"+x);\nshown[x-1] = true;\nif (shown[0] \u0026\u0026 shown[1] \u0026\u0026 shown[2]) divShow(\"done\");\n}",
