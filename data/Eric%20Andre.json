  "description": "We read a bunch of reviews of \"Disenchantment\", which might have been a mistake. You see, they kept comparing Matt Groening's new show to \"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\", and doing so unfavorably.\n\nNone of those reviews mentioned that the first season of \"The Simpsons\" was not exactly great; the now-beloved animated family didn't get good until season two, and didn't reach classic status until somewhere around four. As for \"Futurama\", it has its fans, but we found it very uneven.\n\nSo, \"Disenchantment\"? Much better than we expected from the reviews. It's clearly a different show than Groening's previous endeavors, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a fun fantasy world with many wonderful idiosyncrasies and tons of intriguing possibilities.\n\nJews? There is probably no Judaism in the land of \"Disenchantment\", but all the three leads are voiced by landsmen: Abbi Jacobson as Princess Bean, Eric Andre as her personal demon Luci, and Nat Faxon as Elfo.\n\nSo, we're looking forward to season two. Maybe we did the right thing by reading those reviews... they kept our expectations low, so we were pleasantly surprised!",
