  "description": "Back in 2014, we were overjoyed when we discovered that Australian rules footballer Michael O'Loughlin was an Aboriginal Jew. Turns out he is not the only one.\n\nThe Krakouer family is considered the trailblazing pioneers of Aboriginal football. The most famous are brothers Jim and Phil Krakouer, who played in the 1970s and 1980s. There is a less known brother, Andrew, as well as Jim's son (another Andrew), and nephew Nathan. It's quite a footballing clan.\n\nThe Krakouers are part of the Noongar tribe, indigenous to Southwestern Australia. Their Jewish lineage comes from an Englishman named Theodore Krakouer, who married a native woman. Theodore was... a convict.\n\nAlas, it looks like the Krakouers can't escape their ancestor's past. As a juvenile, Jim served a sentence for rape; as an adult, for amphetamine trafficking. Jim's son Andrew was imprisoned as well, for kicking a man into a coma.\n\nLet's just say that we're not exactly overjoyed about these discoveries.",
