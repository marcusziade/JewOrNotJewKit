  "description": "A year ago today, August 30, 2006, two Jews with nothing better to do started this very website. We began with Lenin and Chaplin, then moved on a day later to Madonna. 136 profiles later, we're still kicking â€” surprising to even ourselves. So on this, the one-year anniversary, we wanted to come up with someone special.\n\nBut then we got busy. Or sick. Or a little of both.\n\nAh, but how can we let work or illness stop us on this special day? So let us hark back to one of our first profiles, Madonna, and talk about her former hubby, Sean Penn. Sean Penn? Jewish? Yes!\n\nWith a name like Sean Penn, one would assume him to be Irish Catholic, but that's only on his mother's side. On the father's, not only were Sean's grandparents Jewish immigrants who ran a Jewish bakery, his great-grandparents were rabbis. So what that the last name sounds goyishe? (It was Anglicized during immigration.) So what that Sean was raised secular and is now agnostic? He's got more than enough Jew in him for this anniversary profile.\n\nAnd definitely more than Madonna.",
