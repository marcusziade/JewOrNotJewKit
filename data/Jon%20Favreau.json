  "description": "\"Swingers\" was on cable the other night, so we decided to give it a whirl. After all, we haven't seen it since its initial run 17 years ago.\n\nOne thing shocked us. And no, it wasn't the lack of cell phones (in one scene, Jon Favreau's character uses a CALLING CARD to call his home ANSWERING MACHINE).\n\nIt's how thin everybody was.\n\nNow, today, Favreau (Jew) and Vince Vaughn (Not a Jew) are not exactly skinny. They are portly, if not obese. Plump, if not zaftig.\n\nIn \"Swingers\"? These are slender, gaunt, svelte men.\n\nWhat happened in these 17 years? What made Favreau and Vaughn balloon so much?\n\nAnd then we took a look in the mirror. And thought about how we looked 17 years ago.\n\nSo, what about those CALLING CARDS???",
