  "description": "We've written pretty much about every HBO show of note (and some not of note: \"Arli$$\"? Multiple profiles about freakin' \"Entourage\"? We apologize!), but somehow we missed this one.\n\nWhat's our excuse? That this show is not exactly our cup of tea? Au contraire! Some of us were really into it! (Except for the ending, natch.)\n\nWhat's there not to love? Intrigue! Murder! Exotic lands! Lies! Betrayals! Blood! Oh, so, so, so much blood!\n\nPerhaps it's because we couldn't find a Jew who starred on it? Well, here is one: Michiel Huisman, not the most important role, of course, but obviously a pivotal one...\n\nWe highly recommend \"The Flight Attendant\"!",
