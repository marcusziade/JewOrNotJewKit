  "description": "\"Why haven't you profiled Moon Knight?!\" asks the intrepid JONJ fan.\n\nWith the all the Marvelous Mayhem happening in the movies (on pause for 2020, but still happening! Eventually!) there is a certain interest in obscure men running around in tights. More than usual, anyway. Plus, it was just announced that there will be a Moon Knight TV show starring the (somewhat) Jewish Oscar Isaac! Isn't it wonderful? Shouldn't we be kvelling all over the place?\n\nWell...\n\nHere's the thing. Yes, the man known affectionately as \"Moonie\" is Jewish (the secret identity is umm, a little obvious. Was Moses Torah already a DC character?). He's also a Batman ripoff who wears an all-white costume (to contrast with Batman's darkness we suppose), throws something called a moonrang (we wish we were joking), and is completely and totally insane.\n\nYup, he's nuts. Certifiable. Coo coo for challah puffs. Which, as a comics character and future TV show subject, makes him interesting and unique. \n\nAs a Jew though? Eh.",
