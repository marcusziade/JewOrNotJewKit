  "description": "Barnett and Rose Buchalter were a typical Jewish Russian parents who emigrated to the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Like many compatriots, they settled in New York's Lower East Side. Barnett opened a hardware store.\n\nThe Buchalters were a huge family! They had five daughters: Sophie, Sarah, Minnie, Sadie, and Leah, and five sons: Jacob, Philip, Manuel, Louis, and Isador. We can only hope to count the number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren!\n\nOne of their sons became a dentist. The other, a pharmacist. A third, a professor. The Buchalters truly lived the Jewish American dream!\n\nAnd then there is little Louis, or Lepke. He rose above all... as head of notorious crime organization Murder, Inc that terrorized New York in the 1930s.\n\nWe're not sure what happened to the dentist, pharmacist, or professor, but Louis ended his life in the electric chair. Amazingly, he is the only top mob boss in American history to receive the death penalty.\n\nThey can't all grow up to be dentists. Right, Jewish parents?",
