  "description": "Barbie, the ultimate goy, a Jew?\n\nCheck out this heritage: invented by Jewish businesswoman Ruth Handler and marketed by her husband Elliot (the ell in Mattel), Barbie is actually named for Ruth's daughter Barbara. Born to Jews, named for Jews, that's downright Jew-rific!\n\nIt's a little confusing, though. After all, what's Jewish about a blonde haired, blue eyed, airhead obsessed with clothes, cars, houses...\n\nOh great. The doll that every little girl is supposed to emulate — a true American icon — and she's a J.A.P.\n \nMaybe we were better off letting her stay in the pink plastic closet.",
