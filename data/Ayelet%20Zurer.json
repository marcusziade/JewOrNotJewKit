  "description": "Why, in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit did we read \"Angels and Demons\"?\n\n\"The Da Vinci Yawn, er Code\" should have taught us our lesson. After an early passage described main character Robert Langdon as a handsomer Harrison Ford, we kinda just switched off. But the chapters were short. So that was something.\n\nBut like the literary lemmings we are, we decided to pick up the prequel cause... well, we don't know why. Gluttons for mediocrity, apparently. And, as such, we weren't disappointed. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not like we're going to be emotionally scarred by the experience (unlike, say, the writings of one Mr. Charles Dickens).\n\nStill, we have no interest in seeing it again now that it has emerged from its paper chrysalis as a full-fledged summer blockbuster. Not even when the part of Langdon's love interest (the Italian Vittoria Vetra) is played by Israeli actress (and Jew, duh) Ayelet Zurer.\n\nNow, admittedly, there have been some changes from the book. Camerlengo Ventresca is now Camerlengo McKenna, to fit actor Ewan McGregor. Perhaps they made a change to Vittoria's character as well, making her Jewish, to fit Zurer?\n\nWhatever. \n\nHere's hoping we've finally learned our lesson with this schlock. If there's a third one, we're leaving it on the shelf. Unless it has a hot Jewish chick in it...",
