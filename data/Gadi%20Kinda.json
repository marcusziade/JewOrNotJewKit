  "description": "The new Major League Soccer season is upon us, and we're somewhat interested in one of its new players. Not too interested, of course, it's not like he plays for our favorite team, but... kinda interested?\n\nHis name is Gadi, and he is an Ethiopian-born Israeli Jew! Born in Africa, his family emigrated to Israel at the age of three. Gadi made his professional debut at 17, and is considered one of the best up-and-comers in his country... This before making the trek from Jerusalem to Kansas City. Kinda a culture shock, to say the least.\n\nWho knows how Gadi will perform stateside, but so far the reviews have been positive. He even scored in both his first games for Kansas City, so maybe he is kinda good?\n\nIt's pronounced \"Kinn-dah\".\n\nWell, there goes the whole profile!",
