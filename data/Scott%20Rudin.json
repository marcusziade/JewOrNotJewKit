  "description": "Producer Scott Rudin has won the fabled EGOT: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony, so why we're not kvelling over him? A few reasons, actually...\n\nLet's just say that Rudin is not exactly the nicest Hollywood fellow. No, he is not Harvey Weinstein (as far as we know); in fact, he and Weinstein have a long-standing feud. But he doesn't exactly treat people well... especially his assistants, going through dozens every year. From verbal assaults to throwing things at them to pushing an assistant out of a moving car... There are just too many to list, so let's just limit ourselves to a small subset of reasons for Rudin firing people:\nFor saying \"My bad\"\nFor not properly wiping a table\nFor making a chart Rudin didn't understand\nFor mispronouncing a name\nFor bringing the wrong muffin\n\nThat last one literally takes the cake!",
