  "description": "There are many things in life we don't understand.\n\nAsh Wednesday. Integral calculus. Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Revolutionary War reenactors. Hot borscht. Cricket.\n\nAnd Jews for Jesus.\n\nSeriously, where do we begin?\n\nWe understand \"Jews\". That part makes sense. We understand \"Jesus\". He has his followers. It's the \"for\" that we have major problem with.\n\nClearly, Moishe Rosen, founder of movement, is cool with the combination. But that doesn't make him a visionary. Just delusional.\n\nJews for Jesus? How does that fit? What's next, Atheists for God?",
