  "description": "For two years now, we've tried to be the website that answers the question of who is Jewish and who is not. But if you are looking for answers to other Judaism-related topics, you better look elsewhere.\n\nNot all Jews practice Judaism the same way. On one side, you have Reform Judaism. In fact, we just heard of a Reform wedding that served suckling pig. Yes, that sounds unbelievable, but trust us, we're not making this up. We just can't explain it.\n\nOn the other side, you have the Hasids. A suckling pig at a Hasidic wedding? That's not unbelievable, that's impossible. Unthinkable. Absurd.\n\nAnd there are many things about Hasidic Judaism that we can't explain. Like, for instance... Oh boy. How do we say it?.. It is a family website, after all.\n\nHmmm... Well, there is a certain rumor about how Hasidic Jews make love. For details, we refer to you to \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", season 4, episode 9, when Larry meets a Hasidic dry cleaner played by Gina Gershon.\n\nWe'll skip those details, but let's just say that Larry is no closer to solving the riddle than we are.\n\nSo no, we can't tell you if the rumor is true or not. But what we can tell you is that Gershon was not only Jewish on \"Curb\", but is one in real life as well.\n\nAnd isn't that what we are here for in the first place?",
