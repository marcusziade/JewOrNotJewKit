  "description": "In a little over a week, the NFL will be handing out the Vince Lombardi trophy to the winner of the Super Bowl. Lombardi, best known as the coach of the Green Bay Packers, was Italian.\n\nThe NHL has, perhaps, the most famous sports trophy: the Stanley Cup, named for Lord Frederick Stanley, who was of English descent.\n\nIn the NBA, their trophy is named for former commissioner Larry O'Brien, who we can only assume is Irish.\n\nBaseball's trophy isn't named for anyone. It's just called the Commissioner's Trophy. Lame.\n\nBut in Major League Soccer, oh good old MLS, when you win the championship, you receive the Alan I. Rothenberg trophy. And Rothenberg is a JEW. A Jew's Jew filled with Jew-y goodness who wants to \"bring Jewish morality to professional sports\". \n\nSo it took a little digging, but, hey, we have ourselves a sports trophy named for a Jew.\n\nWhat? They renamed it last year for Philip F. Anschutz, a \"supporter of conservative Christian causes\"?\n\nUgh.\n\nWell, we suppose he deserves it and all, but it looks like we're going back to the drawing board with this one.",
