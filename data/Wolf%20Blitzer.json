  "description": "As we've discussed numerous times before, Jews often change their names to sound more gentile. We're not necessarily fans of that practice, but... it is what it is.\n\nNot so with Wolf Blitzer. Oh yes, he is indeed Jewish and Wolf Blitzer is in fact his real name (he had us fooled there). But did you know that in the 1970s, Blitzer wrote for newspapers under the alias Ze'ev Barak, the translation of his name into Hebrew?\n\nOf course, when he moved to television, Ze'ev was put to rest and Wolf was back to being Wolf. But we definitely can't blame him for trying!",
