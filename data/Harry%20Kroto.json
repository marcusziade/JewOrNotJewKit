  "description": "Harry Kroto had a dream: he wanted to open a graphic design studio. Unfortunately, Kroto's real job got in the way.\n\nKroto's real job was a chemist. In 1985, he discovered buckminsterfullerene, a spherical carbon module that resembles a soccer ball. In the scientific world, that was a pretty big deal for reasons that are too complex for us to explain. (Alright, we admit it: too complex for us to understand. Kroto got a Nobel in Chemistry for it, so it was obviously a big deal!)\n\nKroto's discovery meant that graphic design had to be put on hold and chemistry had to remain top priority. He dabbled in graphics the rest of his life, but notoriety in the scientific world prevented his dream from fully being accomplished.\n\nPriorities, right?",
