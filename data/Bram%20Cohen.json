  "description": "\"Caring means sharing!\" — Barney the Dinosaur\n\nIsn't that the truth? People who care, share. People who share, care. Thank you, loveable purple behemoth, for teaching us all a lesson!\n\nExcept... not everyone wants to share (and, by extension, care). Let's just say that there are very many who don't like Bram Cohen's creation, BitTorrent. What's BitTorrent, you ask? Well, it makes it easy for people to share files on the Internet. BitTorrent counts its users in hundreds of millions. They all love to share (and care).\n\nAnd yet record companies and music studios are not exactly fans. You see, all this sharing (and caring) cuts into their profits. Maybe they needed to watch more children's shows in their formative years...\n\n\"I love you, you love me, we're a happy family...\" — Barney the Dinosaur\n\nWe're not gonna touch that one.",
