  "description": "In his autobiography, Keith Richards writes, \"maybe it's the Jew in me...\" Whatever could he mean?\n\nWell, we got a mind-blowing revelation for you. Oh, sure, on the outside, Richards is a long-haired, English, goyishe rocker. But on the inside?\n\nIn reality, Richards is a hollow shell. He's controlled with a series of pulleys and levers by a rather bald, tiny man who resides inside that shell... one Mordechai Rosenblum. That is the \"Jew in me\" that Richards is referring to!\n\nOr, you know, not.\n\nSeriously, we have no idea why he wrote it.",
