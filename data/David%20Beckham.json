  "description": "He might not be so smart.\n\nAnd he might not be that good of a soccer player anymore.\n\nAnd he might be the world's foremost metrosexual.\n\nAnd he might be blamed by England for its failures in two of the last three World Cups.\n\nAnd he might have lent his name to an average movie that spun a lifetime of terrible puns.\n\nBut you know what? We'll still take him. Well, a quarter of him, the yarmulke-wearing quarter that was taken to the synagogue by his grandfather. So what if he wears a cross as a fashion statement? He is still the world's most famous athlete.\n\nSo pass the gefilte fish and chips and welcome to our seder, David. We'll leave a seat open for Posh Spice.",
