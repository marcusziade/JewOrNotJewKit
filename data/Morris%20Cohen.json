  "description": "Who was Morris Cohen?\n\nLondon, 1954. An antiquarian bookshop opens on Clarney Drive. It is run by a middle-age couple, Peter and Helen Kroger.\n\nExcept the owners are not really Peter and Helen Kroger. He is Morris Cohen. She is his wife, Lona. And they are Soviet spies.\n\nCohen, a son of immigrant Jews from the Russian Empire, was born in New York. He attended Columbia University on an athletic scholarship... A wonderful story of Jews making it in America. Or so it seems.\n\nFor in 1937, Cohen volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War, where he met a Soviet spy. Cohen was recruited.\n\nHe went on to fight in World War II, married Lona, and then, in 1950, fled the US for the USSR, only to reappear in London four years later under an assumed name.\n\nThe Cohens' spy activity lasted six years, and was deemed extremely successful by the Soviets. Not so for the Cohens, who were nabbed by British intelligence and sent to jail. After eight years behind bars, the Soviets swapped them for a British spy, and they returned to their adopted country, heroes.\n\nOr... do you mean Morris Cohen?",
