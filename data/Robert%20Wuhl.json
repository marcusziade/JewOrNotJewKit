It told the story of a douchebaggy (is there any other kind?) sports agent, who week after week treated some star client and learned some (douchebaggy) lesson in the process.\n\nIt wasn't risky, it wasn't groundbreaking. And for a supposed comedy, it wasn't even remotely funny.\n\nYet somehow, it lasted seven seasons.\n\nNope, in this case, it was definitely TV...",
