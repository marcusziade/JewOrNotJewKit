  "description": "We've previously expressed our beef with the various top 100 lists out there, from the Top 100 Novels (see the profile of Ayn Rand) to the 100 Powerful Women (see Irene Rosenfeld) to, yes, the Maxim 100 (see Rosie Huntington-Whiteley).\n\nBut we have no such beef with A\u0026E's Top 100 Influential People of the Millennium list. After all, they ranked Gutenberg as number one.\n\nHow can we disagree with that one? For us, Gutenberg was incredibly influential. Hell, he helped shape our childhood. Not a day went by when his presence did not affect us in some way. He made us laugh. He made us cry. His work was ubiquitous.\n\nSure, his selection was quite controversial. Sure, there many others could have been considered worthy of the top spot. But for us, Gutenberg and only Gutenberg tops the charts. Has there ever been a film more groundbreaking than \"Three Men and a Baby\"? We rest our case.\n\nWhat's this? The most influential person of the millennium was not Steve Guttenberg, but rather Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press? Well... Sure, we guess that makes sense...\n\nBut he is not even Jewish!",
