Unlikely and scary.\n\nBut then what?\n\nThe Big Bang is a nice enough idea, but what came before the Big Bang? A Bigger Bang? And before that? A Biggest Bang? And before that?\n\nAt that point, we sigh, tell ourselves that smarter men have failed to figure this out, and go back inside to our loving family.\n\nAfter all, there are more important things to worry about.\n\nLike what's for dinner tomorrow night.",
