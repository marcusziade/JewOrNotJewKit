  "description": "Heading into the Tokyo Olympics, we created a rather elaborate profile, ostensibly of rower Nathan Cohen, but in reality listing the best Jewish Olympian at every sport. And then we updated it after the Olympics, because Jews won a bunch of medals, including one in taekwondo. Taekwondo!\n\nNot all sports were listed; for example, known Jews have never medaled in archery, diving, or rugby. Well, you can scratch that last one of the list.\n\n(Yes, at some point, we had someone listed as a Jewish rugby medalist: the brother pair of Bert and Barney Solomon, who took silver for Great Britain all the way back in 1908. \"Took\", not \"won\", because there only were two teams, one game, and Britain lost to Australasia(!), 32:3. But the brothers, even through they are listed on numerous sites as Jewish, were not. Where were we?)\n\nWe now have a Jewish rugby medalist! Sarah Levy, a South African-born, Israel-raised, American! The US upset Australia (it's no longer Australasia...) with a last-second score to win (not \"take\"!) the bronze.\n\nHonestly, even if the Solomon brothers were Jewish, we'd take Sarah as the best Jewish rugby Olympian!",
