  "description": "The title card of \"The Good Place\" is simple. It's a fully green screen with the show's title and four words underneath it: \"Created by Michael Schur\".\n\nNot the show's stars: Ted Danson (an American television treasure) or Kristen Bell (she is Anna in \"Frozen\"!). Michael Schur, the showrunner. Interesting choice, isn't it?\n\n\"The Good Place\" is not the first show Schur worked on. After helping write \"The Office\" (he was also Cousin Mose!), he moved on to create \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", and is currently one of the most sought-after producers for the small screen. (He also co-created a proto-sports-blog, \"Fire Joe Morgan\". Clearly a man of many talents.)\n\nThink about it: when you open a book, the title page doesn't say a name of one of the characters... it obviously shows the author. So Schur is just taking literature and transposing is to TV.\n\nStill, a little self-congratulatory, isn't it?",
