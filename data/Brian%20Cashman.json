  "description": "For a Jew, Brian Cashman, long-serving, well-respected, browbeaten General Manager of the New York Yankees sure does some odd things.\n\nFor instance, last year as part of a Christmas-themed publicity stunt, Cashman dressed up as one of Santa's elves and rappelled 22 stories down a building in his home city of Stamford, Connecticut in the middle of December. Admittedly, this is a strange thing for anyone to do, but for a Jew it's downright bizarre. (The rappelling. We dress up as elves all the time.)\n\nAnother example: local New York bar Foley's has an Irish-American Hall of Fame. One of its newest inductees? Brian Cashman. Such things aren't unprecedented.  Chuck Norris won the Jewish Humanitarian Man of the Year Award after all. \n\nStill, pretty unique behavior for a Jew.\n\nBut Cashman is Irish Catholic. So then it all makes sense, right?",
