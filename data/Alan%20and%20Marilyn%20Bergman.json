  "description": "We've written numerous about the EGOT, winning the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. It's a rare feat, first accomplished by Richard Rodgers in 1962 and repeated rarely since. Well, Alan and Marilyn Bergman will not win the EGOT... but gosh darn it, they just might be the most awarded couple in history.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born Alan and Marilyn (nee Katz) were a songwriting team. Among their credits is \"The Way We Were\", sang by (duh) Barbra Streisand. That got the Bergmans a Grammy for Song of the Year, and an Oscar for Best Original Song to boot.\n\nOverall, the Bergmans got four Emmys (more Barbra collaborations here), two Grammys, and three Oscars, meaning all they were missing was a Tony... but despite working on Broadway, including at least one Tony-nominated musical, they were shut out.\n\nMarilyn passed away in 2022, but, as of this writing, Alan is still kicking it. Perhaps it's not too late for him? Bring Barbra back to Broadway?\n\nIt's probably best not to go for that EGOT.",
