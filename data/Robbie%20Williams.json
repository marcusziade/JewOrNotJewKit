  "description": "British pop star Robbie Williams, who was raised Catholic, is married to Turkish-American model Ayda Field, who was raised Jewish (and her father is Muslim). What a terrific, diverse couple! They have four children together.\n\nNeither Williams or Field are religious, but they do celebrate Jewish holidays, and Robbie even \"considered conversion to Judaism\". So what stopped him?\n\nTHAT.\n\nYep... that. Robbie doesn't want to go through the pain of circumcision, which a true conversion of Judaism will require. Completely understandable, if somewhat disappointing.\n\nNo, we're not disappointed in Robbie. We're disappointed in an ancient ritual that still somehow holds meaning to this day. If a grown goyishe man decides to convert to Judaism to feel closer to his family, why not just let him do so? Why force him to go through...\n\nTHAT?",
