  "description": "Simon Wiesenthal might be known as the top Nazi hunter... but, supposedly, he told a number of tall tales.\n\nFor example, he exaggerated the number of concentration camps he was imprisoned in. (Although he was in five. Can you forgive the man for losing count?)\n\nHis role in the capture of Adolf Eichmann was overstated as well. (Come on, though. Wiesenthal helped bring down Adolf Eichmann. Can you forgive him for inflating his own influence?)\n\nWiesenthal's stories also contain numerous inconsistencies, fables, and plain old hogwash. That being said...\n\nWiesenthal had a role in capturing numerous Nazi honchos. And he did become known as the top Nazi hunter. We don't care how many tall tales he told...\n\nAt least he wouldn't have to exaggerate his Jew Score!",
