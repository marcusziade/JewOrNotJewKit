  "description": "We used to work with someone, let's call him, for the sake of anonymity, J., who decided to raise sea monkeys in the office. You remember those ads in the back of comic books, right? A happy sea monkey family sitting in front of an underwater castle... All for $1.25! (Plus shipping and handling.)\n\nWell, J. tried. And failed miserably, for his sea monkeys died after a couple of days. So he bought a new batch... more death. He tried again... the sea monkey genocide would just not end. Maybe there was no light in the office. Maybe J. was just not suited to be sea monkey overlord. But we, J.'s co-workers, laughed it up. Anything to make office life more palatable, right?\n\nWell, maybe we shouldn't have been laughing. For every time J. got his new batch of sea monkeys, he was actually supporting... white supremacist groups. And, oh, it gets worse.\n\nSea monkeys were the creation of Harold von Braunhut, who also came up with such titillating products as x-ray specs (which didn't x-ray anything) and invisible goldfish (yes, really). And, sadly, von Braunhut was really Harold Braunhut, a Jew... a Jew who became a Neo-Nazi. He supported the Ku Klux Klan and contributed finances to Aryan Nation. Finances he got from gullible children (and J.) buying his various creations...\n\nWell, von Braunhut is now dead, so we are not sure where the money goes if one chooses to buy sea monkeys today. As for J., he moved on to a ficus. Thank G-d he didn't choose invisible goldfish.",
