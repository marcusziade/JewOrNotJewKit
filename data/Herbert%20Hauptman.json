  "description": "Coming to you from our socially distant basement, it's the Jewies! No, they are no longer annual, we've taken a seven year break, but what else is there to do? Today's ceremony is brought to you by Pinchas Masks: 99.4% kosher!\n\nWe'll start with a new category: strangest Nobel winner. This goes to the Jew who won the Nobel, but not in their field. The nominees are... Herbert Hauptman, who is a mathematician, but won for Chemistry (he worked with fellow landsman Jerome Karle on crystal structures, for those curious)... Daniel Kahnemann, who is a psychologist, but won for Economics... Bob Dylan, who is not exactly a literator, but won for Literature, and...\n\nOh, come on, you know who the winner is here. Sorry, Hauptman, Kahnemann, and Dylan, but we have to go with warmonger Henry Kissinger, who somehow won for Peace.\n\nLet's move on to the next category, best interpretation of charoset in a non-holiday setting... and make sure to wear Pinchas Masks: now for your face!",
