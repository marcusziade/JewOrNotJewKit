  "description": "Have you ever wondered why many Jews have long beards? Halacha, Jewish law, prohibits shaving. You want a neatly groomed chin? Tough shit.\n\nSpecifically, one is not allowed to shave with a single-blade razor. So Jews being Jews, there are always loopholes being found. Razors are bad? What about scissors? They have two blades! So clip-clip Jews go, and their facial hair doesn't turn into a monstrosity. Those clever Jews!\n\nOf course, clearing the whole beard with just scissors is rather difficult. So some go a step further. Why not use an ELECTRIC razor? After all, that's not exactly single-blade, is it? And who but a Jew to invent the rotary electric razor, Alexandre Horowitz!\n\nNow we're getting into the area of Talmudic interpretation and heated debate. Jews being Jews, no answer can be simple. So some think electric razor is OK, while others denounce it.\n\nAnd, in case you are wondering, Jewish WOMEN are allowed to shave their facial hair. Aren't you glad we're here to tell you this?",
