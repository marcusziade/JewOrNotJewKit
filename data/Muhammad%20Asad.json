  "description": "So far, we've never profiled a Jew from Pakistan, because, you know... Pakistan.* This will be a first.\n\nFor that, we don't start in Karachi or Islamabad, but in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). And we don't start with Muhammad Asad, but with Leopold Weiss, the grandson of a rabbi and the son of a lawyer. Young Leopold studied the Torah and the Talmud, but when World War I hit, ran away to join the Austrian army at the age of 14. His father dragged him home after a week.\n\nWhen the war finished, Leopold entered a period of wanderlust, meandering through Europe. He eventually ended up in the Middle East, and then... converted to Islam, changing his name to Muhammad Asad. He eventually moved to British India, where he joined the fight for the creation of Islamic state. Hence, Pakistan. In 1947, after the new country was formed, Asad contributed to its constitution, and then held numerous government posts, including ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nSo far, we've never profiled a Muhammad, because, you know... Muhammad. Told you, it's a first.\n\n\n* We did profile the former First Lady of Pakistan, Jemima Goldsmith, but calling her Jewish is a stretch. Her family does have Jewish heritage, but that's as far as that goes.",
