  "description": "Some sports make more sense than others.\n\nJudo, for example, is just fighting. Nothing odd about that. Running, swimming, throwing, these are all actions that come naturally.\n\nEven something like soccer or basketball makes sense. Carry a ball around and attempt to get it in the goal. OK. We can get that.\n\nBut running as fast as you can holding a large metal stick and then using it to catapult yourself as high as you can? What kind of meshuggenah goy thought up that one?\n\nSeriously, that's no sport for a nice Jewish boy from Siberia to get involved in.",
