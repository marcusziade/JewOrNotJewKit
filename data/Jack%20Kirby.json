  "description": "Fantastic Four #511 (written by Mark Waid with art by the late, great Mike Wieringo, not Jews) finds Marvel's first family devastated by the events of recent issues.\n\nA battle with arch-enemy Dr. Doom has left them in tatters, physically and emotionally. Reed Richard's face is permanently, horribly scarred. Ben Grimm, the ever-loving blue-eyed Jew, is dead. \n\nReed, in a last ditch attempt to bring his best friend back to life, uses his genius technology to take the team to, of all places, heaven.\n\nThere, they meet their creator, literally in this case: Jack \"King\" Kirby. He fixes Reed's face with a flourish of his pencil. Brings Ben back to life. And promises them all a happy ending to their story. Then sends them back to Earth. \n\nAnd, for the large number of us that grew up with comics and grew to love them, that's pretty much Jack Kirby. Nothing as blasphemous as a god, but as a creator.\n\nA creator of characters and worlds (and in Kirby's case, whole universes) that each of us in our own way can inhabit and make our own. The essence of the creative exchange, really. Where ideas move beyond entertainment and into something more deeply meaningful. Inspirations. Hopes. Dreams.\n\n\"See the humanity in G-d,\" the fictional Kirby tells them. Leaving all of us to see the little fragments of divinity in humanity.",
