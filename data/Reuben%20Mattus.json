  "description": "Ah, ice cream. I love ice cream, you love ice cream. We all love ice cream. Ice cream! It's great.\n\nAnd the favorite brand of ice cream for some of us at JONJ is H\ufffdagen-Dazs. Oh, the delicious pints that await us in the freezer after a long day's work! How we pine for thee!\n\nDelicious, delicious H\ufffdagen-Dazs, straight from the shores of Denmark. Oh, those Scandinavians sure know their ice cream. And how can you go wrong with an umlaut? You just can't. Hooray for umlauts! Hooray for Danish ice cream!\n\nWait a second... There are no umlauts in the Danish language? Does that mean... Oh. Wow.\n\nH\ufffdagen-Dazs is not Danish at all. It's the brainchild of Bronx Jew Reuben Mattus. In the late 1950s, to battle the mass-market competitors, Mattus created an ice cream that used quality ingredients. To make it sound more exotic, he gave it a pseudo-Danish name, plopped a map of Denmark on its packaging, and the rest is history.\n\nDelicious, delicious history.",
