  "description": "If you ever played any of the Mega Man games on Nintendo (there are at least a dozen), you know the premise: mad scientist Dr. Wily builds eight robots (it's always eight, except in the first game, where it's six). You, as Mega Man, must defeat those robots, learn their powers, then defeat the end boss: Dr. Wily! Then Dr. Wily escapes to return in the sequel. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThere is at least one variation where Dr. Wily pretends to be good. Don't believe him! He is evil! Just look at that grin. That's from the post-NES incarnation, of course. Here is how he looked in the game \noriginally.\n\nYou see that hairdo? Add it to the doctor's first name, Albert. Yep, he is named after Einstein. In the cartoon show, he even speaks with a German accent. His counterpart, the good Dr. Light, is named after Thomas Edison. Not the choices we would have made, but what can you do.\n\n(As an aside, the supposedly good Dr. Light created Mega Man, AKA Rock, to get robot supremacy. Then he created a girl robot, Roll, to do housekeeping. Who is the evil one here?)\n\nAlas, the evil one is still Wily, but we're enacting the Gargamel Law. Goyim can be named Albert and have that haircut! And they can definitely be German...\n\nfunction flip() {\nswapPic('d/dr__wily', 'wily');\n}",
