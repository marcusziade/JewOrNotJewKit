  "description": "In a fairer world, we wouldn't need to tell you who Neil Gaiman is. But then, in a fairer world we'd be writing this from our mansion in Hawaii while eating a corned beef on rye with a knish.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nBut Gaiman is one of the best writers in comic-dom. His excellent Sandman series did more than make him the patron saint of Goth chicks — it redefined what the entire milieu is capable of.\n\nHe's also an accomplished novelist with many successful books under his belt and a new movie up his sleeve (\"Stardust\", based on the book of the same name).\n\nAnd he's a Jew. Bar mitzvahed and all.\n\nSo — an excellent Jewish writer who took an entire genre to a new level and is one of the luminaries of his field. All in all it adds to up to someone we're quite proud to have.\n\nIf anyone knew who he was.\n\n(Editor's update, 2025: Now more people know who he is. Not exactly for the best.)",
