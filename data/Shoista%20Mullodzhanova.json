  "description": "Today, our eternal search for Jews in various strange countries takes us to Central Asia, specifically the ex-Soviet -stans. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan we already covered, thanks to our good friend Zhumabay Akhmetov. We can even check off Turkmenistan, since its Jewish first lady is referenced in the profile of supreme overlord Saparmurat Niyazov. This leaves Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nLet's start with Tajikistan? Not exactly a breeding ground for Jews, eh? Although there is some Bukharan Jew spillover from neighboring Uzbekistan...\n\nOne such spillover was Shoista Mullodzhanova, who was born to a religious Bukharan Jewish family, but grew up to be the then-republic's most famous performer, the \"Queen of Tajik Music\". Good job if you can get it (and check out that hat!). That being said, once the Soviet Union collapsed, the once-called \"Daughter of Tajikistan\" got out, settling in Queens.\n\nOK, so that leaves Kyrgyzstan. That's the one with bride kidnappings, right? Talk about strange countries...",
