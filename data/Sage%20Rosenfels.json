  "description": "As we've explored earlier, there definitely are Jewish football players. But there are not that many Jewish quarterbacks.\n\nBen Roethlisberger and Rex Grossman, both rumored to be Jewish, turned out not to be, as you can read in their profiles. So we're left with Jay Fiedler, who was so average that we haven't gotten to profiling him yet.\n\nBut wait... What's this? Sage Rosenfels is a Jew? The once unknown third stringer who is currently winning games for Houston! All hail our first Hebrew signal caller!\n\nWe're gonna have to slow down here. For you see, only Rosenfels' father is Jewish. And Sage is letting his wife to raise their kids Christian.\n\nLame. For we were so ready to embrace him. That's not happening now.  You weren't even that good in the first place, Sage. Just a glorified third stringer.\n\nAt this rate, we'll end up profiling Jay Fiedler sooner rather than later.",
