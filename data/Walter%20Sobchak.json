  "description": "The Big Lebowski. The Dude. His Dudeness, or, uh, Duder, or El Duderino. Is his story an allegory for Jesus?\n\nHear us out.\n\nThe Dude is clearly Jesus. Hell, he looks like him. Robe, long hair, beard, sandals. Plus he is mellow. The man for his time and place. And a good bowler. Just like real Jesus.\n\nThe Stranger is the omniscient narrator, the Dude's father figure. He has to be G-d.\n\nDonny is the Holy Ghost. He is just there... except when he is not. And then he is just dust in the wind.\n\nThe other Lebowski judges the Dude. He is Pontius Pilate.\n\nJackie Treehorn tempts the Dude. He is clearly the Devil.\n\nMaude is Mary Magdalene. This one is obvious.\n\nJesus... no, not the Dude, but the character of Jesus, the child molester. That's... ummm... We haven't figured that one out yet.\n\nWalter Sobchak? What about Jesus' best friend Saint Peter? A good Jew like him wouldn't roll on Shabbos, would he?",
