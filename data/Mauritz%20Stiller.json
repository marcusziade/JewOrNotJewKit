  "description": "Did you know that 100 years ago Sweden was at the forefront of movie-making? Yes, Sweden, the land of smorgasbord. Go figure.\n\nAnd at the forefront of Sweden's movie machine was Mauritz (Moshe) Stiller, a Finnish-born Jew. (At the time, Finland was owned by Russia, so, to avoid serving the Russian army, Moshe ditched to Sweden. He made the right call.)\n\nStiller acted in, wrote, and directed dozens of silent movies, and soon became Sweden's best-known director. Hollywood came calling, so off Stiller went, taking a young actress by the name of Greta Gustafsson with him. \n\nStiller didn't exactly made the same headway in America. He quickly got disillusioned by Hollywood's studio system and went back to Sweden. \n\nWith the invention of talkies, both Stiller's movie-making career and Sweden's movie industry as a whole took a swift nosedive. Many of his movies are now forgotten or lost completely... but at least one of his contributions had a lasting impact on movie history.\n\nThat young actress Gustafsson? You might know her by her stage name, Greta Garbo.",
