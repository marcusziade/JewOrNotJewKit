  "description": "Akiva Goldsman has an Oscar for Screenwriting, for \"A Beautiful Mind\". So why is he considered a hack?\n\nWe'll let Goldsman answer it himself. \"The screenplays I write are formally very predictable. They're essentially the one-page version of a clothing dummy. They have two legs, a middle, two arms and a head. I can dress them up pretty on a good day, but the structure is simple, and I like that.\"\n\nGoldsman keeps it simple, stupid, which keeps his screenplays simple and stupid. \"His films share a joyless, unimaginative vibe,\" said one critique. Among those are \"The Da Vinci Code\" and its sequel, one of the Transformers movies (we lost track a long time ago), the \"Divergent\" sequel that torpedoed that series, the abhorrent \"The Dark Tower\"... All of them might not be as bad as the one film Goldsman wrote AND directed, \"Winter's Tale\", holding at a solid 13% at Rotten Tomatoes. \n\nOh, and let's not forget \"Batman \u0026 Robin\". Oscar or no Oscar, that's the work of a hack.",
