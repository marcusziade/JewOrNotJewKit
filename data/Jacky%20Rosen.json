  "description": "Watch this: we are going to write a profile of a current Jewish politician without broaching the current political climate. Treading carefully!\n\nThis is Jacky Rosen, one of our country's newest senators, representing the state of Nevada. Before the Senate, she spent two years in the House. Before that, she was a computer programmer. A strange career path, for those of us familiar with the field.\n\nSo how did Rosen rise to Congress? Apparently, Harry Reid, then the Senate Majority Leader, also of Nevada, hand-picked her. She had no political experience... unless you count being president of her synagogue.\n\nLook at that, a whole profile, little to no snark, and no discussion of politics. Terrific!\n\nAs for Rosen's lack of political experience, it hasn't stopped that buffoon in the White House...\n\nCouldn't help ourselves.",
