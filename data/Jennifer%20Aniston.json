Maybe you forgot?\"\n\n\"2000, actually. I'm pretty sure I didn't forget.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you profile her?\"\n\n\"Because she is not even remotely Jewish, and there are no Jewish rumors about her.\"\n\n\"She is not? I'm pretty sure she is part.\"\n\n\"She is not!\"\n\n\"I know I read it somewhere that she has some Jewish heritage...\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure you didn't.\"\n\n\"No, no, I know I did!\"\n\n\"Are you thinking about her character, Rachel from Friends?\"\n\n\"No, not Rachel. Jennifer Aniston. You really should profile her!\"\n\n\"We are not profiling Jennifer Aniston!\"\n\nSometimes it's best not to argue...",
