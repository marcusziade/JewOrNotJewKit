The two compromised: he stayed Jewish, she stayed Catholic.\n\nAlthough, as with many compromises, there are some complications. When  son Max was born, Anne wanted to have him baptized. Mel didn't, so another compromise was reached: Max would be baptized, but also bar mitzvahed when he turned 13.\n\nAnd then, when Max became an adult, what religion did he end up choosing?\n\nJudaism.\n\nSometimes these things just work themselves out, don't they?",
