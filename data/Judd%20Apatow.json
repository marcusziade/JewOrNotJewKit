  "description": "Have you heard? There is a new King of Comedy in America.\n\nNo, it's not Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller. No, it's not Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, and Jonah Hill, although that's getting closer. Thankfully, it's not Dane Cook. Ugh, that guy is just rancid. How can anyone find him even remotely funny? But we digress.\n\nNo, the King of Comedy is writer/producer/director Judd Apatow. Not only has he helped fellow landsmen Rogen, Rudd, and Hill rise to prominence, but every movie he touches turns to gold.\n\n\"Anchorman\". \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\". \"Knocked Up\". \"Superbad\". \"Walk Hard\". \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\".\n\nEven \"Talladega Nights\". That's right, we, Jews, watched \"Talladega Nights\". A movie about NASCAR. Because Judd Apatow was involved.\n\n\"Celtic Pride\"? Well, we all had to start somewhere, right?",
