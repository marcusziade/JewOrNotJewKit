  "description": "John Fisher's parents, Donald and Doris, unleashed The Gap on America. That's right, the Jewish couple from San Francisco created the chain known for its semi-fashionable semi-overpriced clothes. As good a legacy as any, we guess.\n\nWe're not sure what John himself ever created. He had pretty much failed in business until daddy gave him a share of the San Francisco Giants. And then he got rid of his Giants ownership to buy the Oakland A's. So there you have it, John Fisher, a man who hasn't achieved anything in life without his parents' money, a man whose picture one would find next to \"failson\" in the dictionary, owns one of the 32 Major League Baseball teams and is worth north of three billion dollars. That's a lot of khakis.\n\nThose who follow baseball know what Fisher is up to now. The A's, once one of the sport's proudest franchises, have been reduced to a joke.  Good players have been traded for peanuts. Payroll has been stripped to bare bones. Attendance rivals a single-A club. Winning games is an afterthought. All because of Fisher's desire to move the A's to Vegas and raise his net worth... from three billion to four?\n\nSome legacy.",
