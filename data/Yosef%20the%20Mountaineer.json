  "description": "There are plenty of Christian colleges here in the USA and some of them have Christian mascots. Notre Dame's Fighting Irish. Holy Cross' Crusader. \n\nThere are also a few Jewish colleges (Yeshiva is the first that comes to mind). So they have Jewish mascots, right?\n\nYeah, not so much.\n\nWell, we think there ought to be: The Yeshiva Destructive Dreidel. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America Fighting Talmud. Maccabees, Rabbis, Levites. Nothing gets you excited to see your team take the field on Saturday like a giant, bearded, torah-carrying Rabbi doing backflips through a sea of cheerleaders. We know we're not the only ones who feel this way.\n\nOr has Appalachian State beaten us to the punch? Yosef the Mountaineer looks fairly Jewish, doesn't he? The beard, the hat, the name Yosef... Sadly it just isn't so. The name Yosef is meant to be Appalachian dialect for \"Yourself,\" saying that this mascot is a representative of you, the Appalachian State student. Further the plaid shirt and mountaineering career are kind of dead giveaways. \n\nSo back to square one. Some might say it's rude to have a Jewish mascot, but really it's no different than a brawling Leprechaun or a type of knight famous for murdering Arabs. We deserve a plush representative, dammit, and we're not going anywhere until we get one.\n\nGo Dreidels!",
