  "description": "Nobody likes old people. Nobody.\n\nThey've done studies. Young people don't like old people. Middle-aged people don't like old people. Even old people don't like old people. Especially old people!\n\nWell, we got news for you. You are gonna be old. Yes, you, reading this website right now. You, with all your video gaming, texting, and whippersnapping. You! Old. Decrepit. Geriatric. Senile. Old. OLD!\n\nSo stop the hate. Embrace the older generation. They have widsom to share. Stories to tell. Many hours to fill. And some of them don't even smell that bad. Okay, they all smell pretty bad. But so will you one day. You!\n\nHitch up those pants. Pick out a good walking stick. Go to the early-bird special. Move to Florida. Watch PBS. Smoke smelly cigars. Eat your food through a straw. Reminisce about the good old days. That man, the one on the left? That's you one day.\n\nAnd that day is closer than you think.",
