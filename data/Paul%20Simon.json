  "description": "Me and Chaim down by the school yard?\n\nAfter over 200 of these profiles, we've discovered a bit of a theme: If there's a group of even mildly cool people (say a rock band or an ensemble cast of a TV show) the Jewish member always turns out to be the nerdy, less desirable one. Screech, for example. \n\nAnd so, when it comes to Simon and Garfunkel (admittedly on the milder side of mildly cool) if you guessed that Art Garfunkel was Jewish, well, you'd be right. \n\nBut if you guessed, therefore, that Paul Simon is NOT Jewish? Well, then you'd be wrong. They're both Jews. Simon even sings about his own Judaism briefly in the obscure (and rightfully so) Hearts and Bones.\n\nAnd if you guessed that the true answer is that they're BOTH nerdy and less desirable? Well, you clearly have no taste in music. Or at least you've only been listening since 1990. Which is kind of the same thing, really.",
