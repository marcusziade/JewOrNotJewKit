  "description": "Jerry Krause crossed Jordan.\n\nNo, we don't mean the river in the Middle East. Krause, the short fat Jewish general manager of the Chicago Bulls, crossed Michael Jordan, only the greatest basketball player of all time (and, yes, a miserable human being, but who is counting?).\n\nAll Krause did was surround Jordan with a supporting cast that helped the Bulls to six NBA championships in eight years. For that, he was vilified. You see, Krause rubbed Jordan the wrong way, and often acquired players against his star's wishes. So Jordan despised his boss, despite all the success that he helped bring. The disdain spread far and wide; Krause was hated by everyone, from the fans, to the staff, to the coaches, to the players. When the Bulls dynasty ended and Krause was let go, he wasn't able to get a job anywhere in basketball.\n\nPerhaps we should give him a higher K Score... But we don't want to cross Jordan, either.",
