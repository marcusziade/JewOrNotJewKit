  "description": "At some point of our freshman year in high school, our history teacher decided that she needed a break, wheeled in the VCR, and plopped in a tape of \"Glory\". And for the next three days, we reveled in the Civil War, Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and racial equality.\n\nWe didn't care that \"Glory\" won multiple Oscars. We didn't care that it showed the almost-forgotten part of the Civil War. We didn't even care that the director, Edward Zwick, was Jewish! All we cared that we could watch a movie in class. Good on you, history teacher.\n\nAt some point of our sophomore year, our history teacher decided that she needed a break... and once again we watched \"Glory\". It didn't matter that the subject matter didn't exactly mesh with the class. Heck, it beat listening to her going on and on about the crusades, so we didn't complain.\n\nAt some point of our junior year, our history teacher...\n\nWe didn't take history senior year.",
