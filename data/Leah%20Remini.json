  "description": "When we found out that Leah Remini is half Jewish, we didn't get too excited. After all, she is just a sitcom actress. A poor man's Fran Drescher.\n\nAnd when we found out that she is a Scientologist, our already low level of excitement dropped to previously uncharted depths.\n\nBut then we started thinking. It seems that the list of prominent, formerly Jewish Scientologists begins and ends with Remini. Jerry Seinfeld tried it for a while, but he was wise enough to quit. It just seems that Jews are not that... what's the word we're looking for here? Gullible? Dumb?\n\nSo we're sorry for the opening paragraph, Ms. Drescher. We're gonna downgrade Ms. Remini to a poor man's Kirstie Alley. And nobody wins from that comparison.\n\n(Editor's update: Remini escaped Scientology, citing years of \"interrogations\" and \"thought modification\". She even started crusading against the cult. Good for her!)",
