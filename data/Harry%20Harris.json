  "description": "Regular readers know about our continuous lament about the lack of creative Jewish sports nicknames. How many Hebrew Hammers can there be?\n\nSo, let's go back a century to boxer Harry Harris... \"The Human Hairpin\"!\n\nTalk about a fantastic nickname! Not only does it convey Harris' stature (5'8\", 110 lbs, give or take!), but the alliteration that carries through to his real name is top notch. (He was also known as \"The Human Scissors\" and \"The Human Stringbean\", but, clearly, Hairpin rises above the rest.)\n\nHarry the Hairpin wasn't too shabby: he was World Bantamnweight champion in 1901, before moving up in weight class to featherweight. In his career, he only lost two bouts, and was never knocked out.\n\nAs terrific as that is, with a name like Harry Harris... couldn't the nickname hint that he was Jewish?",
