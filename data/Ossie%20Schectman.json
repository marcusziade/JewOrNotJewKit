  "description": "Who is the leading scorer in NBA history? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Not a Jew), of course. Non-basketball fans might remember him as Roger Murdoch in \"Airplane!\".\n\nBut who did Abdul-Jabbar pass as leading scorer? That would be Wilt Chamberlain (Not a Jew). Non-basketball fans might remember him as the man who (supposedly) shtuped over 20,000 women. Supposedly.\n\nBut who did Chamerlain pass? Bob Pettit (Not a Jew). Non-basketball fans... You know what, let's just skip to where we need to be.\n\nOn November 1, 1946, the New York Knicks played the Toronto Huskies in the nascent match of the BAA (which would later evolve into the NBA). The Knicks lineup was full of Jews: Leo Gottlieb, Sonny Hertzberg, Ralph Kaplowitz, Nat Militzok, Hank Rosenstein. And Ossie Schectman, who scored the first basket, briefly (oh, so briefly!) making him basketball's leading scorer.\n\nThe Knicks won, Schectman ending up with 11 points. He was outscored by Gottlieb (14) and two Huskies, including Ed Sadowski (Not a Jew), who exited the game with his own brief hold of the title. Non-basketball fans might remember Sadowski... Oh, right, they wouldn't.\n\nBut maybe they should remember Ossie Schectman?",
