  "description": "At the London Olympics, Felipe Kitadai of Brazil won a bronze in judo. Yes, he is Jewish: he had tasted success at the Maccabiah Games previously.\n\nKitadai took his medal everywhere, including... the shower. There, he realized a bit too late that the medal probably shouldn't get wet. So he did the only logical thing: bit on it.\n\nThe medal fell and got dented. Kitadai was understandably distraught. He pleaded to the IOC, and they replaced his medal with a brand new one.\n\nThis year, Kitadai returned to the Olympics in his home country. Unfortunately, his quest for another, undented, medal came back empty. Too bad the Schlemiel Olympics are not real, or he would be a gold medalist already...",
