  "description": "Four years ago, we profiled Martin Perl, who won the Physics Nobel for discovering the tau lepton, which, in layman's terms, is a heavy electron. As we explained in that profile, there are other subatomic particles... of which the most widely-known are probably neutrinos.\n\nNeutrinos were first theorized by another Jewish Nobel laureate, Wolfgang Pauli, in 1930, but were not discovered until 1956, by Frederick Reines (Jew) and Clyde Cowan (Not a Jew). Pauli's theory was that a neutron can be split into a proton, an electron, and... something with no charge and very little mass. Reines and Cowan discovered that something in 1956, by conducting underground experiments in a nuclear reactor, and that something became known as a neutrino.\n\nFor whatever reason, it took the Nobel committee almost four decades to reward the scientists for such an important discovery. In fact, Cowan, who died in 1974, 18 years after the neutrino's existence was proven, didn't even get the recognition. Reines did, sharing the Physics Nobel in 1995 with...\n\nMartin Perl.",
