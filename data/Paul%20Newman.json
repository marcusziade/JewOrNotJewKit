  "description": "We would gladly take (half of) Paul Newman, the actor. His best-known work might have come before our time, but what we've seen of it, as well as his later films, makes us proud to have (half of) one of the most famous leading men of American cinema.\n\nAnd we would definitely take (half of) Paul Newman, the businessman. Be it salad dressing or lemonade, the fact that 100% of the profits are donated to charities, makes us even more proud to have (half of) him.\n\nAnd we don't even have to settle for that half. Newman, half-Jewish by birth, chose to self-identify as Jewish, \"because it's more of a challenge\".\n\nAnd his salsa is delicious. Now, if he could only create Newman's Own Matzah Balls, we'd be all set.",
