  "description": "The new movie \"Booksmart\" is billing itself as the female version of \"Superbad\"... let's see how many superficial similarities we can find!\n\nBoth are movies about two best friends, both in high school, both nerds, trying to get laid before graduation. Clearly that's a good start.\n\nBoth star one Jew (Jonah Hill, Beanie Feldstein) and one goy (Michael Cera, Kaitlyn Dever) in leading roles. Both feature SNL alums (Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis and Will Forte) in supporting ones.\n\nIn both the \"kids\" are way too old to be kids â€” Hill was 23 at time of the release, Cera an almost-passable 19. Feldstein is 25 (that's really pushing it!), Dever 22.\n\nOh, and Feldstein is Hill's real-life sister! Yes, really! Don't forget that his real name is Jonah Feldstein.\n\nSo, clearly a lot of similarities. That being said, all these new versions are getting tiresome, regardless of gender. Stand on your own, movies!",
