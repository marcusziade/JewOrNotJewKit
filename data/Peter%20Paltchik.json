  "description": "VAR... video assistant referee. Oh, how soccer fans abhor the abbreviation! (Unless it works in your favor, of course. It never works in your favor. We're still infuriated with one specific call six years ago. Moving on.)\n\nSoccer, of course, it not the only sport with VAR. In the Olympics, we've seen it everywhere from beach volleyball to fencing to judo. And in judo, VAR actually determined the bronze medal.\n\nLet's set the stage. Peter Paltchik, who was born in Ukraine but came to Israel as a baby, is fighting Daniel Eich of Switzerland. Paltchik is up a point, and there are only five seconds left. All he needs to do is hold on... but there is a problem. He has two yellow cards.\n\nIn judo, unlike soccer, it's the third yellow card that means you're out. And if you're out, that's it, you lose. So with five seconds left, Paltchik gets that third yellow.\n\nBut wait! VAR! The Swiss fighter can't celebrate, as the referees review the video tape. After an agonizing minute, the yellow is rescinded, and Paltchik holds off for five seconds to win the bronze!\n\nWe guess sometimes VAR walks in your favor? (But we're still pissed off about that soccer call!)",
