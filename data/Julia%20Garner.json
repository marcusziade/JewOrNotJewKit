  "description": "There is too much TV nowadays. There, we said it.\n\nOh sure, we love to turn on Netflix and have at our disposal various series of various genres and qualities... the key word is \"qualities\".\n\nWe already mentioned that in the Noah Baumbach profile, so let's discuss another side of quality: not of shows, but of actors.\n\nTake \"Ozark\", a rather watchable show. It stars Jason Bateman (excellent), Laura Linney (wonderful), and Julia Garner (a revelation). But the rest of the cast, the various rednecks, preachers, gangsters, and FBI agents? We're not gonna name names, but these are some of the worst actors we've ever seen.\n\nNow, Garner is terrific, as we said above. She first came to the scene with a recurring role on \"The Americans\", but here she is completely transformed â€” you would never guess that her redneck is Jewish in real life. So maybe it's great that all this TV is finally giving a bigger chance to talented actors.\n\nToo bad it has to give a chance to talentless ones as well...",
