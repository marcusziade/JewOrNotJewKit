  "description": "For a while there, we were pretty sure we liked Zach Braff. \n\nHe's Jewish (that's Zach Israel Braff to you), he's from New Jersey, he's best known as the star of the quirky, under-appreciated, thoroughly enjoyable show Scrubs. And, on first viewing, we loved Zach's directorial debut Garden State as a quirky, smart, thoroughly enjoyable film.\n\nThen we saw a few interviews. And that cringe-inducing Punk'd appearance. And we discovered something about our new best bud Zach Braff: he seems a little... self-involved, maybe?\n\nThere's something inextricably human in that: There's nothing that we like less about someone we like than them liking themselves. \n\nSo does it turn us off a little? Perhaps. But it's not like we sold our Garden State DVD or stopped watching Scrubs reruns on Comedy Central. We just like them maybe 5% less.\n\nIs that keeping Zach up at night, worried about whether we love him as ardently as we once did?\n\nProbably not.",
