  "description": "Think of all the famous pairs: Abbott \u0026 Costello, Barnum \u0026 Bailey, Ben \u0026 Jerry, Cheech \u0026 Chong, Siegfried \u0026 Roy, Tom \u0026 Jerry, Trinidad \u0026 Tobago... They seem inseparable, don't they? One doesn't make sense without the other. (The one exception is Simon \u0026 Garfunkel. Well, Garfunkel doesn't make sense without Simon. But this is not about them. Where were we?)\n\nRodgers \u0026 Hammerstein. The fathers of Broadway. Forever intertwined.\n\nOr, you know, not. Before Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein, there were Rodgers \u0026 Hart. And it wasn't just a passing thought: the duo collaborated for over two decades and was responsible for much of Broadway's fare in the 20s and 30s.\n\nSo what happened? Why did Rodgers sever his very long, very Jewy partnership?\n\nWell, Hart was an alcoholic. Rodgers found it impossible to keep working with him. And while he did find success with another partner, Hart didn't. Soon after Rodgers dumped him, Hart got drunk, got pneumonia, and... died.\n\nA fate even worse than Garfunkel's?",
