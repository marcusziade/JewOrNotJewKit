  "description": "In case you haven't figured it out yet, some of us are men here at JONJ. And we like sports. Manly sports. Football. Soccer. Tractor pulling. Knife throwing.\n\nBut when the Olympics roll around and our significant others ask us to join them in watching gymnastics or figure skating, we have no choice but to acquiesce. It's the least we can do after sitting through a marathon of \"The World's Strongest Man\" (Magnus Ver Magnusson: Not a Jew).\n\nAnd to keep ourselves from getting bored while watching the said gymnastics or figure skating, we tend to play the Jew or Not Jew game out loud (to the obvious enjoyment of our significant others, as you can imagine). And there actually are quite a few Jewish figure skaters. Silver medalist Sasha Cohen, obviously. Russian silver and bronze medalist Irina Slutskaya (she's half). And Sarah Hughes, who took the gold in Salt Lake City in 2002.\n\nBut this is where it gets messy. Although Hughes is half-Jewish (as the last name reveals, on the mother's side), she listed Christmas as her favorite holiday. And then, Sarah told a journalist that her family \"does not practice a religion, but leans toward Judaism\". On the other hand, she did get elected to the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSo if it's good enough for the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, it's good enough for us. It's not like we'll have any luck finding a Jewish tractor puller.",
