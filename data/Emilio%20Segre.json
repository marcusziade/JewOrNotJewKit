  "description": "For the longest time, scientists were looking for atomic element #43. #42 (molybdenum) and #44 (ruthenium) were long discovered, as were many elements beyond. Yet that #43 stayed elusive.\n\nBetween 1828 and 1933, at least eight different scientists thought that they discovered the mystery element, giving it names ranging from \"polinium\" to \"nipponium\" to \"masurium\". All of these findings were proven to be erroneous. It wasn't until 1937 that it was uncovered, by Italians Emilio Segre (Jew) and Carlo Perrier.\n\nSegre then proceeded to discover another element, astatine, in 1940, as well as the antiproton, in 1955. All of that got him the Nobel in Physics in 1959.\n\nIt wasn't all perfect for Serge. He wanted to name #43 \"panormium\", after the Greek name for Palermo, his university. Instead, it was given the name \"technetium\", meaning \"artificial\".\n\nFor all those previous seekers did not realize that even though #43 exists in nature, it's in incredibly minute amounts. Segre and Perrier created the world's first artificial element.\n\nSometimes it's best to know not to look.",
