If you are only familiar with Deadpool movies, it's not said there, but in the comics, Wade Wilson is definitely Canadian. (Ryan Reynolds probably wouldn't have it any other way.) As for Wolverine? Canadian. Duh. (Hugh Jackman is not, obviously, but that man can pull off an accent.)\n\nDirecting the new movie? Another Canadian, Shawn Levy, and this one is Jewish. His resume is full of collaborations with Steve Martin (\"Cheaper by the Dozen\", \"The Pink Panther\") and Ben Stiller (\"The Night at the Museum\" series), but he has now latched on to Reynolds for three straight movies and a true Canadian superteam.\n\nMaple syrup and... anything?",
