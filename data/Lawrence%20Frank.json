  "description": "Lawrence Frank loves basketball. Sadly, he was never much of a player.\n\nWhen Frank failed to make his high school team, he wanted to stay close to the game, and begged the coach to make him a \"coach trainee\". When he couldn't get a whiff at the University of Indiana, he became the team's manager. And the NBA? You think that a short, white, goofy-looking, ginger-headed Jewish kid had a chance in the NBA?\n\nIt turns out, he did. For in 2004, the short, white, goofy-looking, ginger-headed Jewish kid became the youngest head coach in the NBA when he took over the New Jersey Nets at the age of 33. Holding the \"interim\" tag next to his title, he promptly racked off 13 straight wins, got the full-time gig, and held it since.\n\nWhat's that Woody Allen quote? Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym?",
