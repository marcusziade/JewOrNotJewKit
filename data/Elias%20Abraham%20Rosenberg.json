  "description": "There are a bunch of theories out there that Pacific islanders are a lost Jewish tribe. Incredibly flimsy, we know.\n\nThat being said, let's go back to the 1800s and the court of Kalakaua, the last King of Hawaii. By then, the islands were pretty much Christian, but Kalakua wanted to revive old Hawaiian ways. In that, he found an unlikely ally: Elias Abraham Rosenberg.\n\nLittle is known about Rosenberg's past, but apparently he dabbled in peddling and fortune-telling. In any case, he arrived in Hawaii and quickly earned Kalakaua's trust, becoming a key advisor. (Supposedly, the two liked drinking together. There are worse ways to bond.) Apparently, Kalakaua liked Rosenberg's stories from the Old Testament and tried to learn Hebrew. Rosenberg even claimed that there are references to Hawaii in \"ancient Hebrew texts\"!\n\nRosenberg didn't last long in Kalakaua's court, as jealous locals made sure his influence was short-lived. That being said, under the Jew's watch, Kalakaua continued to move away from Christianity and embraced Hawaiian cultural identity, the effects of which we see to this day.\n\nThey eat a lot of pork in Hawaii. Definitely not a lost Jewish tribe!",
