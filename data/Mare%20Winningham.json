  "description": "In the Kinky Friedman profile, we gave 2 to 1 odds on finding another Jewish country singer. We've written close to 1000 profiles since then, and that search is still barren.\n\nLet's face it... Jews and country music don't exactly mix. The next time a Jew decides to write a song about getting drunk and beating up his wife (that's what country music is all about, right?) will be the first.\n\nSo how do we find a Jewish country singer? Strangely, with a goyishe-born actress.\n\nYou might remember Mare Winningham from her turn as the virgin in \"St. Elmo's Fire\". She also guest starred on \"ER\" and even has an Oscar nomination. And, at some point of her life, Mare decided to become a Jew. Not even because of marriage; she just thought that Judaism was the right religion for her.\n\nAnd, at another point of her life, Mare decided to branch out from acting and became a country music singer. No, she is not exactly Reba McEntire, but will you see Reba release a country album with songs about her Judaism conversion? Mare did.\n\nSo let's cash in on those odds! What, we can't win by betting against ourselves?\n\nRats.",
