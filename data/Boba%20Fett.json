Boba Fett speaks four freakin' lines in the original (aka, only, as far as we're concerned) Star Wars films. He's an ancillary character, at best, mostly added to the canon because his action figure sold well following the ill-conceived Star Wars Christmas special from 1978. \n\nAnd yet, on the list of most popular Star Wars characters, Boba beats almost everyone else. There are aspects of nerd culture we can claim to understand, but this isn't one of them.\n\nSo if we're so contemptuous of Mssr. Fett, why are we writing about him? Well, those four amazing, Tatooine-shattering, lines were spoken by a Jew (Jason Wingreen, also known for \"All in the Family\", amongst other things). \n\nSee, now there's an obsession we can understand completely.",
