  "description": "Pictured is Gunilla Backman. She is a perfectly nice, perfectly normal, perfectly goyishe Swedish lady. Gunilla is a stage actress and singer, performing in Swedish versions of \"The Sound of Music\", \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\".\n\nSo why such a high O Score?\n\nYou see, this is not a profile of Gunilla Backman. Well, it actually is a profile of Gunilla Backman, but it's also a profile of...\n\nKatz.\n\nThat's right, Katz. In the 1980s, Miss Backman, together with Henriette Johnsson, formed a pop music duo called Katz. KATZ! Their one album, pictured if you clicked the link above (you did click the link above, right?), was titled \"Female of the Species\" and just might be the most 80s thing ever... KATZ!\n\nDear Internet, we beg you, please help us out... Why did they call themselves Katz? Was it a kewl way to misspell \"Cats\"? Is there some hidden Swedish meaning? Was it a tribute to, oh, to pick someone at random, Zionist activist Shmuel Katz? Or did Gunilla or Harriette harbor some hidden Hebrew roots? We would really like to know...\n\nAnd we would also like to know what happened to Miss Johnsson. Help us out, Internet.\n\nKatz!\n\nmemorize();\nsetImage('gunilla_backman');\nsetTitleOnly('Gunilla Backman');\nsetSubhead('June 18, 1965 \u0026mdash;');\nfunction loadPic(x) {\nremember();\nif (x == 1) setImage('katz');\n}",
