  "description": "It's time for JONJ trivia!... Pop star Beyonce is related to which Jewish musician?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect! Apparently, someone from Mahler's family moved to America, where they became related to Beyonce's creole/black ancestors. We're pretty sure that there is no blood relation, and this was a long, long time ago, but still...\n\nMakes you wonder, doesn't it? If Gustav Mahler and Beyonce are long-distant cousins, what does that say about any given pair of people? Maybe your hated boss is a long-lost uncle? Maybe the girl you've been dying to ask out hides the secret of a thankfully-undiscovered relation? Maybe Beyonce is not just related to Mahler, but also to Bernstein, Goodman, Mendelssohn, Roth, and Simmons? Maybe ALL of us are related, somehow?\n\nOr, you know, not.\n\n\n\nfunction answer(x) {\n if (x != 3) { alert(\"Wrong!\"); return; }\n  document.getElementById(\"text\").style.display = 'inline';\n}",
