  "description": "Steve Carell is a funny, self-deprecating, big-nosed (yes, big-nosed, might as well come out and say it) actor/comedian whose family Anglicized its name. Jewish, right?\n\nWrong. Believe it or not, there are some funny goyishe actor/comedians out there: Carell and... well, we'll let you know when we think of another one. The Anglicization came from the Italian Caroselli, which is also the likely source of Steve's enormous schnoz. (We covered it before: not all Jews have big noses. Not all big-nosed people are Jews. If it was only that simple, there would be no need for this website.)\n\nCarell's mother is Polish; nee Koch. That gave us a ray of hope, for Koch is one of those ambiguous last names: it could be German, Czech, Polish, or Jewish. But there is no evidence out there that Miss Koch was anything but a plain old Pole. Sigh.\n\nOh... we got it! Ricky Gervais. The other funny goyishe actor/comedian. Good luck finding a third.",
