  "description": "Did we like \"The Rise of Skywalker\"? We've been struggling with that question ever since watching the movie (opening day, natch).\n\nWe think we liked it, but... it could have been better? We exited the theater satisfied, but the more we think about it, the more certain aspects bother us. Like the marginalization of Finn and Rose. Like the unexplained survival of (spoiler alert!) the Emperor. Like Kylo Ren's whole arc. Like the usage of Carrie Fisher.\n\nEpisode VII's was Han's movie. VIII was Luke's, and IX was supposed to be Leia's; alas, Fisher passed away prior to filming. But with Leia being the only one of the original triumvirate to survive the first two sequels, J.J. Abrams tried to shoehorn her in. And it just... doesn't work. If Fisher's scenes seem separate from the rest of the film, it's because they were: they were unused footage from VII and VIII.\n\nAnd then there is the scene with young Luke and Leia, a quick glimpse into the past... and someone who sort of looks like young Fisher. In reality, it was her digitized face on top of Billie Lourd's body. That would be Carrie's daughter Billie Lourd, who played Lieutenant Connix in the new movies, but here had her mother's face pasted on. (Which, let's face it... creepy!)\n\nThat being said... we liked the movie. After all, Chewie did finally get his medal. Spoiler alert...",
