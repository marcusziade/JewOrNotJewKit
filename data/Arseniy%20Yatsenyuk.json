  "description": "Every few decades, the Russian bear awakes from its slumber, decides that his cave is not large enough, and starts looking westward. It tramples everything in its way, rests, is pushed back, wakes up again... Repeat, repeat.\n\nIt looks like the bear has once again awaken.\n\nNo, we don't know what will happen out of the current conflict with Ukraine. It's possible that it will all be resolved diplomatically. But we wouldn't put it past Russia to extend its claws past Crimea and into the rest of the country. It has happened before, after all, time and again.\n\nWhat is it that makes Russia such a beast? Why can't it let things be, why does it try to show its supposed might to the surrounding nations that want little to do with it?\n\nThey even spread antisemitic rumors, for instance claiming that the current Ukrainian Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, is Jewish. There is absolutely no evidence that he is.\n\nSomeone should shoot that bear.",
