  "description": "Emmanuel Lubezki won the third straight Oscar for Cinematography this year, which is pretty darn impressive. No one has ever achieved that before.\n\nHis most recent Oscar came for \"The Revenant\", a sprawling survival tale set in the far north. The first came for \"Gravity\", a mesmerizing survival story set in space. (So, lots of survival.) The Oscar in the middle was for \"Birdman\". Let's talk about \"Birdman\".\n\n\"Birdman\" won the Best Picture Oscar as well. It was adored by critics. Alejandro Inarritu, who worked on Lubezki on the latter two of these films, got a Best Director nod.\n\nWe hated it.\n\n\"Birdman\" was absolutely atrocious, self-obsessed schlock, plotless, pretentious, and pointless. It was a perfect example of the Oscars rewarding an undeserving film. Well, except in one aspect.\n\nLubezki's cinematography.\n\nAs much as we despised the movie, it was shot amazingly. The story took place over several days, but looked like it was filmed in one continuous take. Making outer space and the arctic look grandiose? Lubetzki has to be applauded. Doing so with a story set in a cramped theater? That's something else.\n\nMexican Jew, in case you were wondering.",
