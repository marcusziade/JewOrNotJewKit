  "description": "We had Olympic Week all neatly planned out. We were going to profile five Jewish Olympians, from five different countries, in five different sports.\n\nAnd even though we knew that there were a bunch of Jewish swimmers on the American team, it was pretty clear that the American swimmer were going to profile was Dara Torres. And we did just that.\n\nLeave it for Jason Lezak to ruin our plans.\n\nIf you missed it, Lezak swam the anchor leg for the US 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay. The favored French, who, prior to the race, boasted that they would crush the Americans, held a huge lead after three legs. What did Lezak do? Swam the fastest split in history, beat the French by fractions of a second, and helped USA crush the world record in the process.\n\nAnd for the record, two of Lezak's teammates, Garrett Weber-Gale, who swam the second leg, and Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who swam in the prelims, are Jewish as well.\n\nSo hooray for Jewish American Olympic heroes! At this pace, Olympic Week might just become Olympic Month. And you know what? We wouldn't mind it at all, best made plans or not.",
