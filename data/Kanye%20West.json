  "description": "Fine, readers. Fine! Not a day goes by without a Kanye West suggestion in our inbox. Fine! We're gonna do it!\n\nYou think we're gonna drop that rare Triple Zero score, don't you? You think this antisemite is going to join a very rare club? Alas, we can't. Oh, he comes very close, but there is one small problem.\n\nKanye, despite his pronounced love of Christianity, thinks he is Jewish. Of course, that's this week. Next week, he might think he is the avatar of Vishnu. The week after, that he is a rhinoceros. Who the hell knows.\n\nSo how can someone who thinks they are Jewish be such a virulent antisemite? Honestly, we don't have the energy to parse it. In any case, that insane belief gets him an I point and an exclusion from the Triple Zero Club. This week, at least.\n\nSo, no 0/0/0 here. But a perfect 5/5/5 score on IdiotOrNotIdiot.com!",
