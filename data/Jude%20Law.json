  "description": "According to the almost-infallible Intertubes, some people think that Jude Law is Jewish, because his name is German for \"Jew\".\n\nAhem.\n\nYou got us, goyim. This is what we Jews do. We just love to advertise our Jewishness, and what better way than with a name like that! Of course, we gotta be careful, and \"Jew Law\" sounds just a tad much. (It also sounds like a Law \u0026 Order: Israel spin-off.) So we seek out the German translation: Jude! It's just like the Beatles song! That'll be a good cover if people ever ask...\n\nAnd here's the kicker: Jude is actually his middle name! He is really David Jude Law. Oh, goyim, we thought we could trick you, but you sure got us!\n\nAhem.",
