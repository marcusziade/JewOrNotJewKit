  "description": "Let's see, here. We've covered mice, bears, ducks, dogs, cats, wolves... what about monkeys?\n\nWell is there a more famous monkey than Curious George — the happy little scamp who causes mischief wherever he goes? \n\nSure he doesn't seem Jewish. No stealing of yarmulkes for this fine fellow. And yet, would you believe he has quite the Hebrew pedigree?\n\nHans Augusto and Margret Rey who wrote and illustrated the manuscript for the talented Mr. Curious were both Jews living in Paris in the late 1930s. Then the Nazis showed up and the three of them (two authors and one fictional monkey) were forced to flee on homemade bicycles. Several close escapes and an Atlantic Ocean trip later, they found themselves in New York City, safe and sound with their little future celebrity just a publisher away from worldwide success.\n\nJewish parents, escaped from Hitler, moved to the Lower East Side... Sounds pretty Jewish to us! \n\nOn the other hand, George's original name was Fifi before they changed it for the US audience. \n\nEh — whatever — we'll still take what we can get.",
