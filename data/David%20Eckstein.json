  "description": "Far be it from us to propagate stereotypes here at JONJ.com, but there does seem to be a certain type of Jewish baseball player. Tall. Power hitter with low average. Serviceable fielder. Slow on the basepaths. Smart, but not tricky. Think Gabe Kapler. Or Shawn Green.\n\nThen there's David Eckstein. Gamer. Dirty uniformed, slap hitting, slick fielding, quick moving David Eckstein. In fact, he doesn't fit the stereotype of the Jewish baseball player at all. And that makes sense.\n\nBecause he's not Jewish.\n\nNot even a little bit. Of course, if one's Judaism  were determined by a name, then David would be MVP of the Hadassah instead of the World Series. But Judaism isn't name deep. David's just a hard-working goy playing on Rosh Hashanah and getting slapped on the tuchus after a clutch hit. \n\nOh well. There are worse people to be accidentally tied to. Eckstein may not be the best player, but he is one of the most popular. So we'll take the association if we can't have the man. Just remember to say a prayer thanking G-d on Shabbas that it wasn't Barry Bonds.",
