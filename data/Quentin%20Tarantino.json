  "description": "You can use many words to describe Quentin Tarantino.\n\nHe is a brilliant director. A motormouth. A visionary. A geek. An auteur. A trailblazer. A gargoyle. A terrible actor. A harbinger of violence. A connoisseur of feet.\n\nA feminist? A misogynist? Tarantino is known for giving women deep, complex roles, but also having them beaten, raped, or killed. On the screen, that is, but in real life there are rumors that he is not exactly a gentleman. Better than some of his Hollywood brethren (long-time collaborator Harvey Weinstein, COUGH), but still.\n\nWhere does fiction end and reality begin? Who knows. That being said, apparently Tarantino has sowed his wild oats and recently got hitched, to Israeli singer Daniella Pick, 20 years his junior. They married in a Jewish ceremony, but he did not convert.\n\nFor all the words to describe Tarantino, \"Jew\" is not one of them. He is a lapsed Catholic, if you're curious.",
