  "description": "Look at the man pictured on the left. He is behind one of the most iconic movie characters of all times. He has been quoted non-stop for over thirty years. Who is he?\n\nWe'll give you another hint. He is responsible for an iconic television role as well. For three decades, he made people of all ages laugh. Did we mention that role was of a female?\n\nStill have no idea?\n\nThen we guess piling on more facts, such as that he directed a number of rather funny movies, including \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" and \"What About Bob?\", will not help. Or that his parents, a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, were Holocaust refugees. Unless we mention that one of this man's treasured possessions is a puppet his father made of Hitler and hid under the ground in Belgium, only to dig it up after the war?\n\nFor the answer lies in puppetry, and the man pictured is Frank Oz, whose roles were Yoda and Miss Piggy.\n\nIconic? Make that legendary.",
