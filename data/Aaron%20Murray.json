  "description": "For the last two decades, the Southeastern Conference has been the epicenter of college football. It has produced numerous national champions, and sent many great players to the pros.\n\nMany of the NFL's best quarterbacks went to an SEC school: the Manning brothers, Matthew Stafford, Dak Prescott, Cam Newton (feel free to add Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa when they are ready). Heck, you can go back to names like Bart Starr, Joe Namath, and Mannings' father Archie. But none of the above were statistically the best quarterback in SEC history.\n\nThat would be Aaron Murray. Who?\n\nMurray played four seasons at the University of Georgia, and set all kinds of records. He is the SEC's all-time leader in passing yards  and touchdowns. And, yes, Murray is Halachically Jewish, attendance at Jesuit High School be damned.\n\nSo how did Murray do in the NFL?\n\nThis profile is about college football!",
