  "description": "In \"The Shining\", directed by Stanley Kubrick, the main character, played by Jack Nicholson (Not a Jew), trades his soul for a drink and then attempts to murder his wife and son. It's a happy tale.\n\nDon't agree? Then take it up with the director. According to Nicholson, Kubrick called his film optimistic because \"anything that says there's anything after death is ultimately an optimistic story.\"\n\nWith that belief in mind, it kind of makes sense that, although he was born in a Jewish family, Kubrick moved away from death-as-end-all Judaism toward afterlife-or-nothing Christianity and started celebrating Christmas with his wife and family. But then, there are reports that Kubrick was an atheist, so maybe...\n\nWell, it's all academic now. Kubrick passed on ten years ago so he's not telling. (Unless he is now a ghost, and, much like in \"The Shining\", communication with ghosts is possible...)\n\nBut if death really is a happy ending, well, at least Stanley Kubrick now knows for sure.",
