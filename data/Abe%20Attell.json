  "description": "Abe Attell, the featherweight boxer, was quite a champion at his time. The man known as \"The Little Hebrew\" held the world title from 1906 to 1912.\n\nAbe Attell, the gangster, was quite a scoundrel at the time. Friends with Arnold Rothstein, he played a large part in the 1919 Black Sox scandal that saw the Chicago White Sox throw the World Series.\n\nFor his efforts in the ring, Attell was inducted into: the Boxing Hall of Fame, the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and numerous others.\n\nFor his efforts behind the scenes, Attell denied eight baseball players a chance to continue their careers (the Black Sox were banned for life). One of the players indicted, \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, one of the greatest hitters of all time, lost his chance for the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nIt doesn't seem fair, does it?",
