  "description": "Boris Becker looks like a perfect Aryan specimen. Blond hair, blue eyes. Legendary athlete. Champion. If one was to write an encyclopedia entry on Germans, with a photo attached, Becker would be a perfect candidate.\n\nYou probably see where this is going. After all these profiles, you know what the above paragraph leads to. Something is not what it seems in Beckerland. There must be some Jew in him!\n\nNot exactly.\n\nBecker is only half-German. The other half comes from his mother, a Czech, who was raised Catholic, but does have Jewish family members. How exactly those are related to Becker is not clear. And obviously, Boris himself doesn't consider himself a Jew...\n\nWell, at least he is not full Aryan?",
