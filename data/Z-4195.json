  "description": "\"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen 'Antz'.\" â€” Michael Scott\n\nPremise #1: Every character played by Woody Allen is Jewish. Find one who is not, we'll wait! (Don't say Mickey from \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", who tried to convert to Catholicism. That's cheating.)\n\nSo, Z. Z, who starts out the movie by talking to a psychiatrist. Z, who might as well be Woody Allen shrunk and stuffed into a shell. (The shiksa he pines for: Sharon Stone!) Z has to be Jewish, right?\n\nOne problem: Z is the middle child in the family of 5 million. So does that mean all of Z's siblings are Jewish too? Is the whole ant colony full of Jews? Uh... Let's just say that human rules of Jewishness don't apply to insects, and Z is the one MOT in a million. Well, 5 million.\n\nPremise #2: \"Antz\" is a much better movie than \"A Bug's Life\". Prove us wrong, we'll wait...",
