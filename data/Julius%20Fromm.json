When the Nazis came to power, he was forced to sell his factories for pfennigs on the mark, and then emigrated to England.\n\nStill, next time you put on a condom (see, it's one of those profiles!), thank this mostly-forgotten Jew that you're not strapping on animal intestines!\n\nJulius Fromm did not invented the condom, but he did perfect it...",
