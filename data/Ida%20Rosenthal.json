  "description": "Breasts. Let's talk about breasts. Brassieres, specifically. We'll keep it civil.\n\nDid you know that the bra is a fairly modern invention? It evolved from the corset and was popularized at the turn of the 20th century. Before you ask, it wasn't invented by a Jew. But a Jew sure did more than her share to popularize it!\n\nHer name was Ida Rosenthal (nee Kaganovich), and she was a Russian immigrant who moved to America and became a seamstress. Ida saw an opportunity: the clothing of the day did not emphasize the woman's breast (for shame!). So she started a business, Maidenform, which specialized in garments that did the opposite. Which means, yes, bras.\n\nSoon, Maidenform took over the market. By the end of the 1930s, Ida's bras were selling all over the world.\n\nAnd while she didn't invent the brassiere itself, she did create a number of variations, including the maternity and nursing bras. She is also the one who came up with cup sizes. So next time you think of double Ds, think of a little Jewish lady!\n\nSee, we kept it civil!",
