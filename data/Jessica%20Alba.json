  "description": "Hello, Miss Alba! Welcome! Make yourself at home.\n\nYes, we heard all about the recent revelations about your Jewish ancestry. Your four-times-great-grandmother, is it? Who's counting, really!\n\nLet us give you a tour... here we have a library, where we have tome after tome filled with Jews arguing with each other. Here is the kitchen, where we can prepare such delicious dishes as kishkes and... Latkes are good! Who doesn't like latkes?\n\nFeel free to hit us up with any questions about Judaism and Jews. Did you know that Sylvester Stallone has Jewish ancestry too? Well, he does!\n\nAnything else you would like to know? Why yes, Jewish men do make great husbands! You are so well-informed!\n\nNo, the creators of this website are not available. Stop it, Miss Alba! You're making us blush!",
