  "description": "If you watch \"Saturday Night Live\", as sometimes (despite its lack of creativity and originality) we do, you must have noticed the show's lack of performers of color. Sure, they have Kenan Thompson, who has to stretch his limited acting talent to play almost every black role imaginable. And they have Maya Rudolph, who plays not only black, but often Hispanic. Or Italian. Or anything else with even a hint of color.\n\nWell, Maya Rudolph is not Hispanic. Or Italian. Yes, she is black â€” on her mother's side. Her father's side, as you might have guessed from her inclusion on this site, is Jewish. And the combination gives Maya just that necessary bit of color and exoticism that allows her to show off her range in front of her mostly talentless castmates.\n\nStill, we're not talking exactly about Gilda Radner here. Rudolph might be adequate on it, but SNL still sucks. So why are we still watching it?...",
