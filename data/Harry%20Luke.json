  "description": "Today, our Jewish tour around the world is taking us to Oceania. You know, Oceania, the various islands speckled on the mighty Pacific Ocean. Not too many Jews on those rocks...\n\nSo, just like our tour's numerous visits to Africa, we will turn to that underappreciated category, colonial administrators! Watch us mark off half of Oceania with one simple profile!\n\nFor that we turn to Harry Luke, whose long illustrious career in bureaucratic administration took him everywhere from Azerbaijan to Barbados to Sierra Leone. Between 1938 and 1942, Luke served as the mighty High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. He was in charge of the British Western Pacific Territories, a vast Oceanian region that spanned the modern countries of Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\n\nTo be fair, we can't exactly call Luke Jewish, as he had a Catholic mother and converted to Anglicanism. However, during his stint as  Lieutenant Governor of Malta, he was subject to numerous antisemitic attacks due to his Hungarian Jewish heritage...\n\nDid our tour take us to Malta yet?",
