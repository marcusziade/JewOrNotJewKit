  "description": "You may not think that Jews and Buffalo-area sports fans have much in common, but we do.\n\nSuffering.\n\nWho has suffered more than Buffalo? \n\nThe Sabres have never won the Stanley Cup, and their fans have watched in despair as favorites like Hasek and Mogilny have fled to win championships with other teams. The NBA Buffalo Braves left in 1978, never to return, but still haven't shaken the curse â€” they became the moribund Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nAnd the Bills? The team that Buffalo lives and dies by became synonymous with disappointment when they made the Super Bowl four times in a row only to lose all four times. The recent future isn't much rosier: their last playoff appearance came in 1999, when they were victims of the Music City Miracle.\n\nSo you take all the little joys you can get in Buffalo and Marv Levy, co-architect and coach of those great early 90's Buffalo teams, is definitely more than a little joy. A certified Hall of Fame sports figure and a certified Hall of Fame Jew. It doesn't get much better than that. Of course, for you Buffalars you may have to squint a little on that K score to see a 5, but trust us, it's there if you want it to be.\n\nBecause, let's face it, you deserve a break. To be Jewish AND a Buffalo sports fan? Oy, we can't imagine...",
