  "description": "If there is a mold for making defensive linemen, then Igor Olshansky comes from it:\n\nBig (6'5\", 315 lbs). Strong (he pressed 505 lbs in college, a team record). Mean (he once punched Broncos' center Tom Nalen in the face during a game). \n\nBut, y'know what isn't in the mold for a defensive lineman? How about two Star of David tattoos?\n\nYes — big, strong, mean Ukrainian Igor Olshansky is a Jew. An overt Jew who attended Jewish day school, married a Jew, and seems quite happy to be recognized for his heritage. And we're more than happy to recognize him. \n\nWatch out goyim — Igor Olshansky is coming to crush your quarterback.",
