  "description": "Lion Feuchtwanger was considered Public Enemy #1 in Nazi Germany. Was he a daring revolutionary? A communist agitator? A clandestine spy?\n\nFeuchtwanger was a writer of mostly historical fiction. His wrote novels about Goya and Flavius Josephus, Edward II and Benjamin Franklin. Many of his books are still widely read today.\n\nOh, and he also wrote a fictionalized story of the rise and fall of the Nazis. That was in 1930, three years before they took power for real. Hitler wasn't exactly a fan of his work.\n\nFeuchtwanger became an outspoken critic of the Nazis, was jailed, released, jailed, escaped (disguised as a woman), and then made a miraculous trip from Europe to America.\n\nOh, and two of Feuchtwanger's most famous novels are \"Jew Seuss\" and \"The Jewess of Toledo\".\n\nNazi Germany's Public Enemy #1 was Jewish? Of course!",
