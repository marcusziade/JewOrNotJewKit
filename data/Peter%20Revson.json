  "description": "There are not that many Jewish playboys. (Hugh Hefner is not Jewish, we checked.)\n\nThere are not that many Jewish race car drivers. (We didn't check. We didn't have to.)\n\nThere are not that many Jews who die young. (Ever since that guy 2000 years ago, we learned to take care of ourselves.)\n\nThere are, however, a few Jews who are heirs to cosmetic fortunes. (The Factors. The Lauders. In this case, the Revlons.)\n\nSo yes, Peter Revson was at one time the Revlon heir. And, unlike other Jews (to be fair, he was only half Jewish), he got the first three mentioned categories covered. A playboy who once dated some of the most beautiful women in the world. A race car driver, the last American-born one to win a Formula 1 rice. And a young death, crashing during a practice run at the South African Grand Prix.\n\nSo, young Jewish (and half Jewish) cosmetic heirs, if you don't want Revson to stand alone here, the ball is in your court. All you need to do is date a bunch of supermodels, and drive a race car to your death. In that order, preferably.",
