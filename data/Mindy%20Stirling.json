  "description": "Mindy Stirling often gets confused for... Mindy Stirling.\n\nThat will be Mindy Stirling, pictured here, the actress best known as the rather German Frau Farbissina of the Austin Powers movies, and Mindy Stirling, not pictured here, a singer/songwriter. The latter Mindy is the daughter of actress June Vincent, so, if you google \"Mindy Stirling mother\", it will tell you \"June Vincent\". Which is obviously true, if you are talking about the other Mindy Stirling, but we are not!\n\nOur Mindy Stirling's mother was a dancer named Florence, whose parents were Lithuanian/Polish Jews. The other Mindy Stirling is as goyishe as Frau Farbissina.\n\nMindy Stirling often gets confused for... Rhea Perlman.\n\nYou know, we can see the resemblance!",
