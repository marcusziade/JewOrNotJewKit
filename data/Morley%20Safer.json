  "description": "We like our job. We don't love it, of course. It's a job. It pays the bills. It has its ups and downs. And irritating co-workers. And absurd rules. And pointless meetings. Many, many pointless meetings. No, seriously, we don't hate it. It's OK.\n\nThat being said, we can't wait until retirement. On our terms, of course. The day when we won't need to work any longer. The day when we can walk into the boss's office, drop our badge, and quit. And then... kick up our heels, and... travel? Start collecting stamps? Write the great American novel? Do nothing? That's decades away, of course.\n\nYou know what will then be awful? Dying. Well, dying is awful by definition, but to die right after retirement? That would be the worst. No travel. No stamps. No... well, you get it.\n\nMorley Safer retired from 60 Minutes on May 15, 2016, at the age of 84. Four days later, Morley Safer died.\n\nThat being said... we're willing to bet that Morey Safer liked his job a little more than we do...",
