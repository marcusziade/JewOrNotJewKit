  "description": "It's time for another installment of our \"Ask Jew or Not Jew\" feature, where young readers write in for advice. Here's a letter we recently received.\n\nDear Jew or Not Jew, I'm running for class president in a school with many Jews. Should I claim I'm a quarter Jewish or something? Will that help me get any votes? â€” Abigail Hansen, 17, Millburn, New Jersey\n\nOh Abigail, Abigail, Abigail...\n\nPoliticians claiming Jewish heritage for votes is an American tradition! And we say \"American\", we're not limiting it to the US. Take a look at Brazil, where President Dilma Rousseff claimed she is part Jewish.\n\nDid it help Dilma? We doubt it. Brazil's Jewish population is 100,000 in a land of 200 million. Of course, she won anyway, and is now... universally hated, with approval rating hovering below 10%.\n\nNow, you say your school is more Jewish than Brazil... But here's our advice:\n\nIf you need to claim you're Jewish to run for office, maybe you shouldn't run in the first place.",
