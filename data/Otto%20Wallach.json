  "description": "Hooray! Somebody brought doughnuts into the office today! A cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast!\n\nUgh, all the chocolate ones are gone. But that strawberry one sure looks delicious, doesn't it? Now to bite into that fruity goodness...\n\nHmmm... strawberry, you say? Let's read the ingredients of that fruit filling. Water, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavor, guar gum, titanium dioxide (color), salt, polysorbate 60, potassium sorbate... Ummmm... did a single strawberry die to make this doughnut? Artificial flavor?\n\nYes, artificial flavor. Not just in that strawberry doughnut, but in the majority of mass-produced food.\n\nOur guess is that Otto Wallach, who won the Nobel in 1910, had no idea what his organic chemistry research would lead to. Other than artificial flavors, his contributions were also used in perfumes. Maybe we have to thank him for that faux strawberry smell as well.\n\nOh well. This profile is done, and so is this doughnut. Artificial flavor or not, it wasn't too bad. Perhaps we'll have another!",
