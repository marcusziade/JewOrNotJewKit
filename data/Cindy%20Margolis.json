  "description": "You might have noticed a small change on JONJ today. The Businessmen category, which contains a motley crew from all walks of life, from Russian billionaires, to gangsters, to infomercial salesmen, to hockey commissioners, has been renamed. It is now called \"Businesspeople\".\n\nFor Cindy Margolis, our subject today, is a BusinessWOMAN. No, not a typical businesswoman, but one who propelled herself from obscurity to being named the \"Queen of the Internet\" and landing in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most-downloaded person.\n\nAnd that \"Queen of the Internet\" is Jewish. A little unexpected, of course, but not completely. We all know that Jewish parents try to instill their offspring with a certain work ethic and determination. It's just that in this case, they also instilled Cindy with 34D-25-37 measurements.",
