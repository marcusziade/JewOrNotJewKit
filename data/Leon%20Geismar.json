This creates a problem in a lot of regions, especially Africa. That being said, we've gotten quite good at Jew-finding, as evidenced by the map below:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a large portion of the continent is covered, including such Jews as boxer Victor Perez (Tunisia), prime minister Leon Kengo (DR Congo), and anti-apartheid activist Ruth First (South Africa and Mozambique). And now we can fill even more gaps with just one profile. Witness!\n\nFor that, we need to go back to the well of colonial administrators. Leon Geismar, a French Jew (he supposedly converted to Catholicism after marriage, but what can you do), was the Governor-General of French West Africa: modern day Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo!\n\nNow, he was only in charge for four months in 1938, and was later kicked out by the Vichy government because of his Jewish origins (that Catholic story didn't play), but we'll have to count it. (Not like we'll have much luck finding another Jew in Burkina Faso...)\n\nA few gaps still left... we'll keep looking!",
