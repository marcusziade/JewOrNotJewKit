  "description": "Many scientists have won Nobels. It's an exclusive club, sure, but over the years, the numbers have added up. The scientific elite of the last century plus, if you will. (For the purpose of this profile, we will exclude the Peace and Literature prizes from discussion.)\n\nAnd you know what all those brainiacs have in common? Be it if they won in Chemistry, Physics, or Medicine, whether they come from Europe or America, if they are goy or Jew... They all have PhDs. Of course, they do.\n\nWell, there are some exceptions. Very, very few exceptions, but we got one right here: Gertrude Elion (Jew, of course), who shared the Nobel for Medicine in 1988. Her contribution is the development of numerous medications, including one that led to the creation of AIDS drug AZT.\n\nSo, just in case you do not want to continue your education but have the dreams of joining that scientific elite...\n\nOh, who we are kidding. You're not winning that Nobel. Sorry.",
