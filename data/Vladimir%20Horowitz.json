  "description": "\"There are three kinds of pianists: Jewish pianists, homosexual pianists, and bad pianists.\" â€” Vladimir Horowitz\n\nLet's test that maxim!\n\nHorowitz himself was Jewish, of course. No doubt about that. And he was very likely homosexual... there is enough evidence out there to suggest it, but we will leave that for our non-existent colleagues at GayOrNotGay.com. Still, he checks the Jewish box, so no need to explore further.\n\nFeel free to play along, but here are some famous pianists:\n\nArthur Rubinsein: Jewish\nEmil Gilels: Jewish\nBenjamin Britten: Gay\nBilly Joel: Jewish\nMichael Feinstein: Jewish\nLiberace: Gay\nMartha Argerich: Jewish\nMyra Hess: Jewish\nVan Cliburn: Gay\nVladimir Ashkenazy: Jewish\nMarvin Hamlisch: Jewish\nElton John: Gay\nArtur Schnabel: Jewish\nLeonard Bernstein: Jewish and gay\n\nSo, if you play the piano, and you're not Jewish, and you're not gay...\n\nGood luck?",
