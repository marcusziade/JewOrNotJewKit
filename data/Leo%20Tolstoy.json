  "description": "Confession: we've never read \"War and Peace\" or \"Anna Karenina\". Now let's talk about Leo Tolstoy.\n\nWhy is his name translated into English? Not transliterated, but actually translated? In Russian, his name is Lev. So why Leo?\n\nHere's a thought: perhaps it's done to avoid setting off the Jewdar? After all, \"Lev\" does sound a tad Jewish (and that beard is not helping), so covering it up with \"Leo\" would erase all doubts. (Adding the titular \"Count\" in front wouldn't hurt either.)\n\nTolstoy, obviously, was not Jewish at all: the Russian Lev is a rather standard name for both goyim and Jews. Now, if he was Leyb Tolstoy!\n\nStill, his translation stands pretty much alone. Not like Fyodor Dostoevsky is known as Ted...\n\nConfession: We've never read \"Crime and Punishment\" or \"The Brothers Karamazov\" either.",
