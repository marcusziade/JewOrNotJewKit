  "description": "Bob Geldof: Rocker. Humanitarian. Creator of Live Aid and Band Aid. Bono? Bono's got nothing on Geldof. Especially since... well, let's ask the man himself.\n\nWhen asked if he was proud of his Jewish ancestry, Geldof said:\n\n\"I could not give a fucking shit.\"\n\nWell, we be damned. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Geldof goes on, \"I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing â€” the nothing won.\"\n\nBut this is not NothingOrNotNothing.com! (Quick Nothing Score: 2/4/5, we'll let you work out the particulars.) This is JewOrNotJew.com, for crying out loud! And people... people give a fucking shit, Bob. About your Jewishness, at least.\n\nBut we, Bob, we don't give a fucking shit about YOU.\n\nYeah, we said it. And we won't take it back. It's not like you'll ever give enough shit to visit our website.",
