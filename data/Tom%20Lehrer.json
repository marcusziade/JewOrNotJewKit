  "description": "Tom Lehrer had quite a mufti-faceted career. He was a well-known musician and satirist, with a career spanning half a century. He was also a renowned mathematician, and had taught at various top universities. In fact, Lehrer owns one of the lowest Erdos-Bacon-Sabbath numbers on record (see the Ray Kurzweil profile for the explanation).\n\nHe also invented the jello shot.\n\nYeah, let's talk about that one.\n\nAfter serving in the Army, Lehrer joined the NSA. To bypass the agency's liquor restrictions, he came up with an idea of adding alcohol to gelatin mix, creating the world's first jello shot. You'd think that this was attempted before, but no... It took a piano-playing, zinger-making, math-professing, army-serving Jew. High school parties haven't been the same since.\n\nTalk about a modern renaissance man!",
