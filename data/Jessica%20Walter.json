  "description": "Oh boy, a Jessica Walter profile! Will we talk about Arrested Development? Or perhaps the critically acclaimed Archer?\n\nNope. We're gonna talk about Dinosaurs.\n\nNo, not dinosaurs. \"Dinosaurs\". Remember? Of course, you don't.\n\nIn the 90s, dinosaurs were everywhere. Not actual dinosaurs, natch, but their likeness. From movie screens to sports arenas to kids' lunchboxes, you couldn't escape those prehistoric creatures. And TV followed suit, to the tune of a sitcom named, aptly, \"Dinosaurs\".\n\nIt followed all the usual tropes: blue collar father, homemaker mother, two teenagers, a baby that kept hitting his father with a frying pan... Yes, these dinosaurs had frying pans. This is the 90s, what do you expect!\n\nIn any case, Walter starred as a matriarch of the family. And since we've known to transpose the Jewishness of actors to the characters they play, could we actually consider her allosaurus to be at least somewhat Jewish?\n\nYes, Jewish dinosaurs. That's what we're getting to.\n\nMaybe we should have just talked about Arrested Development...",
