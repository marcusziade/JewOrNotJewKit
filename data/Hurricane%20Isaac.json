  "description": "Those of us who live in North America are expecting a special guest this week. Is it the prophet Elijah? No, it's Isaac! And instead of bringing some rugelach from the city or a well aged red like a mensch, he'll be brandishing 70 mile an hour winds, 18 inches of rain, flooding, and category 1 destructive forces! Hooray!\n\nBut with such a biblical name, could our new blustery bud be Jewish?\n\nWell, Isaac was born from the combination of several nameless tropical storms in the Caribbean, so there's little we can really know about his parentage. Isaac will also be cold, windy, and loud, which... OK, yeah, that could totally be Jewish.\n\nOn the other hand, Isaac also plans on driving thousands of people from their homes, whereas any good Jew would always choose to stay at a hotel rather than inconvenience anyone.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, Isaac's final destination? New Orleans.\n\nNow, if he was heading for Florida, we could see it, but Louisiana?",
