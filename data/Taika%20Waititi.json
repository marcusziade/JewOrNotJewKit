  "description": "Our quest for a Jewish Eskimo took over four years, 999 profiles, and the lives of two unfortunate walruses. Our quest for a Jewish Maori? All of four minutes. And we're not even exaggerating.\n\nThe Maori, of course, are indigenous people of New Zealand. Known for their tattoos and their (former) cannibalism, they are about as far from Jews as one can possibly fathom.\n\nYet here we have it, a rather famous Jewish Maori: director/actor Taika Waititi, whose credits include episodes of HBO's \"Flight of the Conchords\", starring those wacky Kiwi darlings (and no, not Jews), Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie. He is due to appear in the big-screen adaptation of \"Green Lantern\" as Thomas Kalmaku, (wait for it...) an Eskimo.\n\nInterestingly, like many Jews, Taika had used a pseudonym to hide his true origins: his mother's maiden name, Cohen. Go figure.\n\nSo where are we off to next? Will we find Jews in African savannas, Asian mountains, or South American pampas? We'll keep that under wraps for now. One thing for sure: even finding a Jew inside Mars' craters won't surprise us at this point.",
