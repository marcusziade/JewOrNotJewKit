  "description": "Shake those hips and sing Hava Nagila, the King is one of us! Or... is he?\n\nIf it was only so simple. One theory states that Elvis had a Jewish maternal great-great-great-grandmother, which would make him Jewish in the Halachical sense. The other theory states that that great- (let's skip a few greats) grandmother was a myth, a figment of the imagination of a delusional relative who lied to a biographer.\n\nAlas, it is the second theory that is true. However, Elvis definitely showed some reverence for the chosen people. As a child, he was a shabbos goy for a rabbi neighbor. As an adult, he donated to Jewish charities. He even wore a Chai necklace (sometimes paired with a cross), saying \"I don't want to miss out on going to heaven on a technicality.\" (Of course, if he really was Jewish, he'd know that our concept of heaven quite differs from the Christian one. But can't blame a guy for trying.)\n\nAnd you can't blame us for wanting Elvis on our team. We certainly would prefer him to that OTHER Jew known as \"The King\", right?\n\n(Editor's update: We're fully aware of claims and even \"proof\" that Elvis had Jewish lineage. However, actual genealogical research has shown otherwise. So, Not a Jew.)",
