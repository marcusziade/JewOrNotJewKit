  "description": "Everyone knows that James Watson and Francis Crick got credited for discovering DNA, and most know (or should know) that Rosalind Franklin should have really gotten the credit, but few know the role that Max Perutz played. So let's talk about Perutz.\n\nPerutz, born in Vienna to a Jewish family that converted, got out as many (former or not) Jews did, when Hitler annexed Austria. A chemist (his parents were disappointed that he didn't become a lawyer; you can't stop being Jewish so easily, conversion or not), he taught at Cambridge, where one of his students was Crick. Franklin was also at Cambridge at the time.\n\nSo Perutz took Franklin's unpublished research and shared it with Crick. The rest is history: Watson and Crick got the accolades, and Franklin... died. It's only recently that she has been getting the credit, but it's not like \"Who is Rosalnd Franklin?\" is the default Jeopardy question to \"This Brit discovered DNA\". Perutz tried to defend his actions, saying that Franklin demonstrated her findings in a lecture that Watson attended, but come on.\n\nPerutz was a renowned scientist himself, winning the Nobel for Chemistry in 1962, the same year Watson and Crick (but not Franklin!) won for Medicine. Good thing no one stole his research...",
