  "description": "Would you believe that a Jew actually won the America's Cup?\n\nFor those not up on elitist sports, the America's Cup is the world's most prestigious yacht race, held every four years or so. Not too many Jews involved, unless you count Larry Ellison, who owned the American boat that lost this year to New Zealand, but won the previous edition.\n\nAnd yet, in 1962 and 1967, the winning yacht was skippered by Emil Mosbacher.\n\nEmil is probably the lesser known of the Mosbacher brothers: his younger brother Robert (who converted to Christianity) was Secretary of Commerce under George Bush Senior.\n\nEmil himself had a stint in politics. After retiring from yachting, he served as an advisor to Richard Nixon.\n\nFrom winning the America's Cup to advising Nixon... No, that's not exactly what you expect from a Jew.",
