  "description": "Davos, Switzerland, February 1936. A student named David Frankfurter walked into a house, looking for a man named Wilhelm Gustloff. Gustloff was talking on the phone, so his wife escorted the visitor to the study.\n\nFrankfurter sat down at Gustloff's desk, opposite a giant portrait. Gustloff, his conversation now over, entered the study. Frankfurter introduced himself.\n\nHe then took out a gun and shot Gustloff five times.\n\nFollowing that, he went to a neighboring house, called the police, and confessed to the murder.\n\nWilhelm Gustoff was the leader of the Swiss Nazi party. David Frankfurter was a proud Jew.\n\nGustoff was made a martyr by the Nazis, who used his death in propaganda leading up to Kristallnacht. Frankfurter was tried in the supposedly-neutral Swiss court and put in jail. He was pardoned after the end of World War II.\n\nWas it worth it? Hard to tell.\n\nBut it sure makes a rather awesome story...",
