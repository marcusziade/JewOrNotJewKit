  "description": "Time to look in our mailbox! Here we have a five-year-old fan from Pennsylvania who wants us to profile somebody named Francine Alice Frensky. We have no idea who this Francine is...\n\nWait a minute! Did we just say, \"five-year-old fan\"???\n\n(Now we know what you're thinking. Hey, Jew or Not Jew, you're making this up! Nope. We're not. The five-year-old got her aunt to write us, saying that we \"missed one\", begging to profile Francine...)\n\nSo: Francine Alice Frensky. A Jewish orangutang(!) from PBS's \"Arthur\". She loves sports, and is rather tomboyish. And props to PBS â€” not only do they have a token Hanukkah episode, there is a Yom Kippur one as well! We've never seen that on other networks! (That is, until our possibly written sitcom, \"That's Treif!\", makes it to the air. But we've said too much.)\n\nSo, as you see, we can't say no to a five-year-old fan. Come to think, how come our own five-year-old hasn't sent in a suggestion?",
