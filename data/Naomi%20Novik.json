  "description": "Are there Jews in European fairly tales? Of course, there are! You haven't read our re-telling of the \"The Jew Among Thorns\" by the Brothers Grimm? Click the link below!\n\nBack already? Yeah, not the best example. Doesn't paint Jews in the best light, to say the least. Anything else?\n\nWell, there's Rumpelstiltskin, but we clearly don't think he is Jewish. Just read his profile... Click the link below!\n\nBack again. So, yeah, no real quality Jews in European fairy tales. So here we are recommending American fantasy author Naomi Novik, whose Hugo-nominated recent novel \"Spinning Silver\" re-tells the story of Rumpelstiltskin by placing it in fictionalized magical Poland. (Poland is anything but magical in real life.)\n\nAre there Jews? You betcha! Novik, who is half Jewish, half goyishe Polish, uses both sides of that heritage to weave (pun intended!) a magical tale. We enjoyed it immensely. (Her other novel in the same vein, \"Uprooted\", is really good as well.)\n\nSo, we'll settle for the Jews of \"Spinning Silver\". It beats \"The Jew Among Thorns\", that's for sure.",
