  "description": "Sometimes, our quest of determining Jews finds inconsistent  information. In those cases, we try to find quotes from the profilees themselves to sway our verdict one way or another.\n\nTake Julianna Marguiles, best known for \"ER\" and \"The Good Wife\". Some places list her as Jewish. Some, as a Jewish Christian, whatever that is. Well, let's see what she says.\n\n\"I wasn't raised Jewish. My parents are Jewish, but my mother had herself baptized when I was five years old. She took a Christian path â€” not born again, but Christian spiritual.\"\n\nAlright. Since Julianna  says she wasn't raised Jewish, it looks like the Jewish Christian, whatever that is, crowd might win. Let's see if we can dig some more. Here's what she says when asked about playing a Hasidic Jew in a movie. \n\n\"I think I'm the only Jew [in the cast], even though I'm not really religious.\"\n\nOh. So she does consider herself Jewish. Well, good for her, it looks like her mother's path did not rub off. But let's keep on reading.\n\n\"I was fascinated to find out about the Jewish Hasidic life. It's a very sexist religion and a very sexist community. And I can't imagine why anyone would want to be in it.\"\n\nWe're not gonna even gonna try to touch that quote.",
