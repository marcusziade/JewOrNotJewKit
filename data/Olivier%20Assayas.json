  "description": "Olivier Assayas is an award-winning director of such films... well, you haven't seen any of them. He is a an award-winning French film director. Let's leave it at that.\n\nAssayas found out he was Jewish on his thirteenth birthday, when his father told him that it should have been his bar mitzvah today. So we probably shouldn't go above \"Borderline Jew\" for Assayas. Let's leave it at that.\n\nFor fifteen years, Assayas was involved with actress Mia Hansen-Love, who is 26 years his junior. Can we leave it at that? We can't!\n\nWhat's a quarter a century between friends, you say? Nothing can stop true love, you argue? Well, Assayas met Hansen-Love when she was 17!\n\nBut they are French, and you know how French people are! Besides, 17 is almost 18! And they didn't start dating until she was 20!\n\nIf you have to come up with so many excuses... You probably should just leave it.",
