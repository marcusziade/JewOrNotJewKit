  "description": "\"The Godfather\" saw Marlon Brando win the Best Actor Oscar. A trio was nominated for Best Supporting: James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino (they all lost). All four are giants of American acting.\n\n\"The Godfather Part II\" saw Pacino rise to Best Actor nominee (he lost). Once again, there was a trio up for Best Supporting: De Niro (he won), as well as Lee Strasberg and Michael Gazzo. All giants of American acting?\n\nWe're not sure about Gazzo, but in Starsberg's case, you can actually make that statement, and not necessarily because of his role as Hyman Roth. His list of credits might be barren (just seven movies in a career that spanned five decades), but his success as acting coach is undeniable. While the Russian Konstantin Stanislavski is credited with \"The System\", Strasberg was its foremost practitioner in America. Among his students were the aforementioned Pacino and De Niro, as well as Marilyn Monroe, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman, Anne Bancroft, James Dean...\n\n\"The Godfather Part III\"? Let's just move on.",
