  "description": "Today, we're going to solve a mystery: is soccer player Daniel Lovitz related to master thespian Jon Lovitz?\n\nFeel free to skip this profile. We understand that the intersection of American soccer fans and Jon Lovitz acolytes is rather limited. For the few of those in the same boat as us, read on.\n\nThe short answer: unlikely. Daniel, who currently plays for Nashville in MLS and has appeared for the US national team, is 5/8 Jewish. His ancestors came from Russia with the name Lovitz.\n\nJon, only one of the funniest people in the history of people, comes from Jewish Romanian stock. But his family's name is not originally Lovitz; it was changed from Ianculovici.\n\nSo it looks like they are not related. Oh well. If only we could solve the bigger mysteries:\n\nWhy is Jon Lovitz so underappreciated?\n\nWill the general populace ever care about American soccer?",
