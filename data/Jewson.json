  "description": "Let's say you're in England and hire a building contractor. Maybe you're tired of your flat in the city and want to build a cottage in the countryside. You need space for your sheep to graze. It's a hypothetical situation.\n\nIt's quite likely that this builder will go to Jewson, one of the biggest chains in England that sells everything from wood to insulation to toilets. It's like Home Depot, but for contractors. In the UK. And, yes, it's named Jewson. It's there in big letters and everything.\n\nNo, Jewson is not exactly Jewish. It was started all the way back in 1836 by a man named George Jewson, who wasn't exactly Jewish either. It's obviously possible that he had Jewish heritage down the line, but the fact that he served as a deacon kinda puts a damper on things. Still, Jewson. Selling pipes and paint.\n\nIn this situation, the contractor builds you a very nice cottage and doesn't overcharge you a pence. Again, purely hypothetical.",
