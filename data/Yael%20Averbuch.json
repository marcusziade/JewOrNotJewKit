  "description": "Yael Averbuch has had a rather accomplished soccer career. She has carved a successful niche in leagues here and abroad, and has appeared for the US national team 26 times. Alas, none of those appearances came in the World Cup or the Olympics.\n\nThat being said, Averbuch can lay claim to something none of her more famous, gold-medal-winning teammates cannot: she scored the fastest goal in (women's) soccer history.\n\nFeel free to find it on Youtube by searching \"Yale Averbuch fastest goal\", but we'll give you a quick rundown. Playing for the University of North Carolina in a college game against, ahem, Yale, Averbuch lobbed a goal directly off the kick-off and into the net. It was an amazing shot, to say the least, clocking in at under four seconds.\n\nJewish, of course. She's Yael, not Yale.",
