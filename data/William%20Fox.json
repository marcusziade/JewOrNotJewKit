  "description": "CNN stands for \"Cable News Network\". NBC, \"National Broadcast Company\". HBO, \"Home Box Office\". What does FOX stand for?\n\nFirst of all, \"FOX\" is not an acronym, and that is important. In 1985, the film studio 20th Century Fox merged with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Murdoch kept the Fox name on the studio, and handed it to his fledgling television network, and later the cable news channel and various other outlets.\n\n20th Century Fox was created in 1935, when Twentieth Century Pictures merged with the Fox Film Corporation. Fox Film Corporation was created in 1915. Based in Fort Lee, NJ, it was a leader in early filmmaking, both silent and sound.\n\nThe owner of Fox Film, once a titan in the movie industry, lost almost all in the stock market crash in 1929. A year later, his corporation was subject to hostile takeover, which led to the merger mentioned above. That original owner? William Fox, Jew. So, yes, FOX is named after a Jew.\n\nGood thing he changed that name from Fuchs, right?",
